Olaf Sleijpen: Counting what's missing - building sustainability 
statistics in a data-scarce world
Speech by Mr Olaf Sleijpen, President of De Nederlandsche Bank, at the opening of the 
Irving Fisher Committee Satellite Seminar on "Sustainability data issues and central 
banks", Amsterdam, 4 October 2025.

A warm welcome to you all, welcome to De Nederlandsche Bank. And thank you for 
giving me the opportunity to come to the office on a Saturday. I must say I don't do this 
very often, except on very special occasions. And this is a very special occasion. We 
are proud to host the Satellite Seminar of the Irving Fischer Committee on Sustainability 
data issues and central banks' experience.
And I think it is rather fitting to hold this seminar on World Animal Day. Because in a 
way statisticians are like animals. There are many different species of you, you are 
essential to the economic ecosystem, but you are not always treated very well. And 
some of you are even under threat from some nasty examples of Homo sapiens.
So on a day like this, and also on World Statistics Day later this month, it is good to 
remind the world how crucial reliable data are for global progress. Good data, and good 
statistics based on that data, are key to making informed decisions in a complex world 
and a modern economy.
Now let's zoom in a bit on the role of central banks. Central banks play an important 
role in providing high-quality statistics on the economy and the financial sector. That is 
because, as monetary authorities and often also as financial supervisors, central banks 
gather a lot of data. And we have the skills and the knowledge to organise, analyse, 
and interpret these data to draw meaningful conclusions.
In this rapidly evolving world, there is a need for statistics that are both timely and 
responsive to current developments. This is particularly the case for data on 
sustainability and climate risk. Climate change and nature degradation form a risk for 
financial institutions, financial stability and long-term economic development and may 
impact price developments. And that's why climate change and nature degradation are 
well within the mandate of central banks and prudential supervisors..
There is huge demand for reliable statistics on climate risk. But sustainability data and 
statistics are still a relatively new field. There are still significant data gaps. For financial 
institutions, there are currently no global and consistent legal requirements to submit 
sustainability data. Reporting mandates still differ greatly in terms of stringency and 
scope across countries.
So the situation is not ideal. But given the urgency of the climate problem and the 
demand for data, we cannot wait for the perfect dataset. We need to get to work with 
what we have and collect and make use of existing and available sustainability data.

Over the past years, many of us have gained experience in unlocking the value of these 
data. And today we are here to share these experiences and ideas for the future of 
sustainability data and statistics.
Alternative data sources can be of great value here, and looking at today's schedule I 
am glad to see that multiple sources are being explored, from payment system data to 
data from companies' balance sheets.
A great example of an alternative data source that I recently became aware of is 
PortWatch. This is an open platform designed by the IMF that uses satellite data to 
monitor and simulate disruptions to maritime trade flows. It turns out you can use 
PortWatch to simulate the effects of alternative climate scenarios on world trade. The 
platform shows that the impact of climate change on the economy, and therefore on the 
financial sector, is broad. Indeed, climate change is a many-headed monster.
On top of using alternative data sources, new data science techniques can also help 
generate better statistics and insights.
For example, we rely on many different data sources to create sustainable finance 
statistics, and these datasets often need to be combined. In many cases, a unique 
identifier or clear definitions are still missing. So this is quite a complex task. New data 
science techniques can be of great help here.
Because one thing is really important. And that is that we should aim for consistency 
and transparency in how data is collected and stored. Whether this means linking 
macro to micro data, combining reported, satellite, modelled or proxy data, or merging 
data from public and commercial sources. Because if we don't, we will only make it 
harder to compile and harmonise statistics to enable comparison across countries.
Another example of new data science techniques is nowcasting. This is a technique 
that may help overcome specific challenges stemming from the dependency on data 
that become available only following a delay. Commercial data on carbon emissions for 
instance. At DNB and in cooperation with the ECB, we have therefore applied a data 
science technique called 'nowcasting'. Thanks to this technique we can provide more 
timely carbon statistics for the euro area, as users of our data have often requested.
In a world that is scaling back on corporate sustainability reporting, there will obviously 
be an impact on the availability of source data to compile statistics. One possible 
outcome is that we will need to rely more on modelled and imputed data for the time 
being. This makes it all the more important to base these data on transparent and 
harmonised methods across jurisdictions.
So, to wrap up, we need to be creative, we need to be smart, and we need to work 
together. And that's also what this seminar is about. Climate change is a global 
problem, and there is a global need for better data. The issue is new and complex and 
we are all facing the same types of challenges, so cooperation is both logical and 
necessary. The Data Gaps Initiative is a very good example of this. Also, committees 
like the IFC provide a valuable platform for cooperation.

I understand this seminar is only the first stage of a true statistics tour through the 
Netherlands. The ISI World Statistics Congress kicks off next Monday in The Hague. 
But for some, a full week of statistics is still not enough. Here at DNB on the 13th and 
14th of October, we will host the International Working Conference on primary 
emissions data at the product level.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Tonight, we are taking you on a boat tour along the 
canals of Amsterdam. After all, somewhat in the spirit of World Animal Day, statisticians 
can be seen as a special kind of animal, and we do care about your wellbeing.
I wish you a wonderful day.
