SPEECH
The digital euro: maintaining the autonomy of the
monetary system
Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of
the ECB, University College Cork Economics Society Conference 2025
Cork, 20 March 2025
It is a pleasure to participate in the annual conference of the UCC Economics Society. Today, I wish to
discuss the digital euro, which is an important project at the ECB.[ ] Draft legislation has been proposed by
the European Commission and is currently under consideration by the Council of the European Union and
the European Parliament.[ ]
A few years ago, archaeologists excavated two silver coins at Carrignacurra Castle, not too far from here.
[ ] The first was a groat (a coin worth four pennies) from the 1200s depicting Henry III; the second was a
coin from the 1400s featuring Edward IV. These two coins indicated a society that regarded precious metal
as the embodiment of intrinsic value and closely associated money with sovereignty.
Over the centuries, the currency circulating in Ireland has changed multiple times. From 1927 until the
launch of the euro, the Irish pound (the punt) was the national currency of Ireland. The punt was not
backed by a precious metal, such as gold or silver. Rather, it was a fiat currency that derived its value from
government regulation, the assets backing the currency and trust in the issuing authority, the Central Bank
of Ireland and its forerunner the Currency Commission. Until 1979, the punt was pegged to the British
pound sterling at a 1:1 exchange rate, reflecting the historical linkages with the United Kingdom and the
significant bilateral trade volumes. It operated as legal tender until around a quarter century ago, when
Ireland along with ten other EU Member States introduced the euro (twenty countries are now members of
the euro area). By adopting the euro, Ireland reinforced its commitment to European integration, while also
reducing its dependence on the UK monetary and financial system.
The developments in Ireland’s currency over time demonstrate how monetary systems are shaped by
broader societal and economic transformations. For instance, the history of Irish money includes two
episodes of free-banking money, whereby private banks issued banknotes that were used by the public as
means of payment.[ ] In this aspect, the monetary history of Ireland resembles that of Scotland, England
and the United States. This history can shed some light on the current debate about the new forms of
private money that are emerging today, such as stablecoins in the context of a digitalising society – a trend
that has become more pronounced in recent years.[ ]

In an increasingly digitalised society, in which the role of physical banknotes issued by the central bank is
receding, the question arises whether the European Central Bank should issue a central bank digital
currency (CBDC) for the euro area.[ ]
Today, I will explain why it is imperative for the ECB to introduce a digital euro.[ ] I will first discuss the
roles of central bank money and commercial bank money over time, before describing a range of
scenarios that suggest a digital euro is necessary to preserve the monetary autonomy of Europe. Finally,
before concluding, I will outline the benefits of the digital euro for Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union.
Our current monetary system
The three main properties of money
Let me begin by recalling the three main characteristics of money: (i) it serves as a unit of account, (ii) it
provides a medium of exchange, and (iii) it is a store of value.
The unit of account property solves a basic coordination problem in any economy: it is a lot easier to set
prices and wages vis-a-vis a single benchmark (a loaf of bread is priced at, say, €2) rather than firms and
households resorting to a diversity of benchmarks (a loaf of bread is priced at 10 apples). Through its
interest rate and balance sheet policies, the central bank can provide overall price stability by ensuring
that average prices do not rise by more than two per cent per year over the medium term.
The medium of exchange function reflects the superiority of monetary exchange to barter-type alternative
systems. Suppose someone earns income by working as a university professor but wishes to consume a
wide range of goods and services: it is a lot simpler to receive her salary in euro and pay for her desired
goods and services in euro rather than searching for suppliers that might be willing to exchange a
particular good or service for a customised university lecture. A huge volume of transactions occurs every
day, with firms and household buying and selling products in exchange for monetary payments. The
central bank anchors the payment systems that process these transactions. In particular, a request by a
customer with an account in Bank A to make a €100 payment to a merchant with an account in Bank B is
settled through an interbank transaction in which €100 is deducted from the reserve account of Bank A at
the central bank and €100 is credited to the reserve account of Bank B at the central bank.
Money also acts a store of value. Alongside other financial and non-financial assets, households also hold
bank deposits and banknotes in order to transfer purchasing power from one period to the next. Since
overnight bank deposits (current accounts) pay nil or very little interest and banknotes do not pay interest,
money is typically dominated by other assets in relation to long-term saving and investment plans.[ ] At the
same time, money provides a highly-liquid store of value and its roles as a unit of account and medium of
exchange are closely connected to its role in preserving liquidity from one period to the next.
Two sides of the same coin
In essence, our monetary system consists of two layers: “central bank money” and “commercial bank
money”. The use of the term “money” here does not mean that we are speaking about two independent
6
7
8

types of money. In practice, central bank money and commercial bank money are intertwined: indeed, it is
essential that households and firms view these as equivalent. The label simply refers to the type of entity
that issues the respective components of the aggregate money supply. More general terms for these two
layers underline how money is created and distributed in the economy: since central bank money
(banknotes and the central bank reserves held by commercial banks) is issued by the central bank, it
originates outside the private sector and is referred to as “outside” money. By contrast, commercial bank
money (bank deposits) originates from, and circulates within, the private sector and is called “inside”
money (seen from the perspective of the private sector).
As central bank money is issued directly by the central bank, from an accounting perspective, it is backed
by the assets of the central bank. That is, the Eurosystem can increase the supply of euro “outside” money
by crediting the reserve accounts held by commercial banks at the central bank in exchange for assets.
This can be done by providing a loan to a bank (strictly, a temporary collateralised loan under its
refinancing operations) or by acquiring bonds.[ ] As noted above, the reserve accounts held by commercial
banks at the central bank are an essential component of the overall monetary system, since most
monetary transactions involve an interbank transfer from the customer’s bank to the merchant’s bank
whereby funds are deducted from the reserve account of the customer’s bank and credited to the reserve
account of the merchant’s bank. In turn, this implies that a commercial bank can only efficiently provide
banking services to its customers (and maintain the trust of its counterparts) if it has sufficient central bank
reserves to meet payment and withdrawal requests. Currently, commercial banks hold about €3 trillion in
reserve accounts in the Eurosystem (corresponding to about 20 per cent of euro area GDP). As euro
liabilities of the central bank, these reserves are the ultimate safe asset: there is zero credit risk. Moreover,
reserves are the highest form of liquidity (one euro is always one euro), which is the foundation for
reserves as the settlement asset for inter-bank transactions.
The supply of euro “outside” money also includes about €1.6 trillion in banknotes (about 10 per cent of
euro area GDP). Mechanically, banknotes are supplied via the banking system: an individual bank might
request €10 million in banknotes to feed its ATMs or in response to the currency demands of its corporate
customers and its reserve account with the Eurosystem is duly debited for this amount. If the bank does
not have enough reserves for that operation, it must borrow them either from another bank or from the
central bank itself. In the aggregate, this means the central bank also funds its acquisition of assets by
issuing banknotes.
Unlike standard liabilities of other institutions, central bank money is not redeemable for commodities
(such as gold) or alternative means of payment or stores of value. Instead, its intrinsic value comes from
its acceptance as currency, which is deeply connected to the credibility of the monetary policy of the
central bank in maintaining its value in terms of purchasing power (that is, maintaining price stability). This
credibility is crucial because it shapes public trust in the currency and its stability.
In turn, the authority and credibility of the central bank are intrinsically linked to its sovereign foundations.
In national currency systems, the central bank is established by the nation state as the monopoly provider
of “outside” money.[ ] In the euro area, the ECB was established by the Treaty on European Union and
9
10

controls the issue of euro as a currency, with the mandate to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem
(comprising the ECB and the national central banks of those EU Member States whose currency is the
euro) decides and implements monetary policy decisions.
By contrast, commercial bank money is created through the lending and intermediation activities of
commercial banks. Mechanically, when a bank makes a loan to a firm or household, it creates a deposit in
the account of the borrower, thereby increasing the overall money supply (the sum of outside and inside
money). The value of commercial bank money – mainly bank deposits – is pegged to central bank money:
a €50 deposit has the same value as a €50 banknote. In turn, this means that retail transactions can be
settled either by transferring funds from the bank account of the customer to the bank account of the
merchant or by paying in banknotes.[ ] The equivalence of bank deposits and banknotes is maintained
through the promise of convertibility of bank deposits into banknotes (and vice versa): in particular,
customers always have the outside option to withdraw their deposits in favour of banknotes that are
backed by the central bank.
While banknotes (and coins) are still widely used to purchase goods and services, the central role played
by commercial banks in an efficient payment system reflects the transactions services provided by banks
to their depositors: inside money is particularly attractive as a means of payment, especially for large-scale
transactions.[ ] [ ] For all these reasons, commercial bank money today accounts for the bulk of the
money in circulation. For instance, in the euro area, the size of our broad monetary aggregate M3 is ten
times that of the banknotes in circulation.[ ]
Inside money is ultimately backed by the assets of the commercial bank, primarily loans and, to a lesser
extent, bonds. Put differently, commercial bank money is not completely “information insensitive” in the
following sense: its value is conditional on the creditworthiness of borrowers and the financial health of
banks. For this precise reason, commercial banks are heavily regulated and closely supervised. In
addition, deposit insurance limits the risk that a liquidity shortage may hamper the capacity of the bank to
convert deposits into cash in full and on demand, while central banks typically respond to systemic stress
events by elastically providing liquidity to the banking system. While these safeguards are extensive, the
traditional ability of customers to convert bank deposits into banknotes has played a foundational role in
ensuring that the value of inside money is anchored by the value of outside money. In particular, outside
money is entirely “information insensitive” since it is the central bank that statutorily issues currency, which
is the ultimate means for discharging liabilities in the economy. Furthermore, the direct access of the
general public to outside money in the form of banknotes has underpinned the stability of the unit of
account: in this way, everyone in society has had a personal (and, indeed, emotional) connection to
central bank money.
An evolutionary process towards a flexible but stable monetary system
This two-tier monetary system emerged gradually over the centuries.

The coins that were discovered in the nearby excavations in Cork are clear examples of state money –
complete with depictions of a sovereign that reinforced the authority of the state backing the coins. Of
course, the emergence of state money goes further back. In ancient civilisations such as the Roman
Empire or imperial China, state money provided a degree of standardisation in terms of weight, metal
content and design that ensured trust in the value of the coins.[ ] This way, state-issued coins were
recognised and accepted across the vast territories of the empire; these were “information insensitive” –
facilitating trade and taxation and, in general, monetary exchanges. The standardisation was a public good
which generated widespread benefits that individual agents could have not easily produced on their own,
thus improving social welfare. A broadly accepted means of payment facilitated the local exchange of
goods and fostered trade over longer distances. As indicated earlier, this contrasts with the disadvantages
of the direct exchange of goods (or barter), which requires the “double coincidence of wants”.[ ]
The need for more efficient financial instruments to support the expanding trade networks and economic
activities in those economically dynamic empires also gave rise to the origins of inside money. In the
China of the Tang Dynasty (the High Middle Ages in western chronology), the “feiqian” or “flying cash” was
developed to solve the challenges of long-distance trade. The “feiqian” functioned as a promissory note,
allowing the holder to redeem it for cash at a designated location. That experience paved the way for the
issuance of “jiaozi”, the first exchange notes, which appeared before the end of the first millennium. These
circulated freely in the market, becoming the first paper money, which helped China overcome challenges
such as coin shortages in the context of a rapidly growing economy.[ ] Moreover, it is worth noting that
Song China’s paper money was initially freely issued by private merchants and later taken over by the
government to ensure stability and trust. The lessons from China’s monetary history do not end there:
over-issuance brought paper money to an end during the 15th century (Ming dynasty).[ ]
The complex societies of Rome and imperial China also generated early forms of banking.[ ] However,
the economic revival of late medieval and Renaissance Europe recreated banking in a way that expanded
its activities to accepting deposits, making loans and engaging in trade remittance, with a proliferation of
letters of exchange. All that came with a simple, but crucial, technological innovation affecting ledgers:
double-entry bookkeeping improved the accuracy, transparency and reliability of financial records.[ ]
Nevertheless, Renaissance Europe experienced challenges related to the complexity and fragmentation of
the system, with numerous kingdoms, principalities and city states each issuing their own currency. In
certain cases, this gave rise to a sort of “currency substitution”, with a widespread acceptance and use of
certain currencies well beyond their issuing region due to their perceived stability, the economic and
political power of their issuers and the trust these commanded in international trade.[ ]
Still, the public deposit banks of that period, which were precursors of central banks as we know them
today, contributed to the stability to the monetary system and reduced its complexity. These public deposit
banks offered settlement of payments in their accounts and some of them were pioneers in creating
certificates of deposits that could be used as proto-banknotes.[ ] Indeed, it was that government backing
15

that helped the banknotes issued by the Swedish Riksbank (founded in 1668) and by the Bank of England
(founded in 1694), the oldest central banks that still operate today, to achieve widespread acceptance in
the course of the 18th century.[ ]
The popularity of banknotes reflected a tacit acknowledgement that a monetary system solely consisting of
precious metals was not only inconvenient but could not keep pace with the rapidly growing needs of
commerce.[ ] Without a government monopoly in the issuance of banknotes, private institutions not linked
to the government also started issuing banknotes, as had already occurred in China almost a millennium
earlier. The apex of that development occurred during the free-banking experiences in the 19th century, a
system characterised by competitive note issuance with low legal barriers to entry, and little or no central
control of the assets backing these banknotes.[ ] At that time, these assets mainly consisted of scarce
commodities such as gold or of certain securities deemed to have low enough risk.
However, repeated panics and banking crises during the century led early central banks such as the Bank
of England and the Riksbank to de facto assume the role of lender of last resort – one of the classical
tasks of a modern central bank, as articulated in Walter Bagehot’s Lombard Street: a description of the
money market in 1873.[ ][ ] By ensuring that banks had sufficient liquidity to meet requests to exchange
bank deposits for cash, the frequency and severity of banking crises were reduced and the resulting
system helped bridge the gap between outside and inside money. The gap was further closed by the
growing moves towards the central bank’s monopoly as sole issuer of banknotes and the legal
establishment of state-backed paper money as legal tender.[ ]
However, at the time, central banks and governments had not yet developed the institutional frameworks
and policy tools necessary to manage such fiat currencies effectively.[ ] Rather, credibility relied on
backing currency with metallic standards. The straitjacket of a metallic standard constrained their ability to
flexibly respond to macroeconomic fluctuations and financial crises – as evident, for instance, during the
gold standard period.[ ]
As the twentieth century progressed, the monetary system evolved beyond the constraints of metallic
standards. The comprehensive regulation of banks, the establishment of deposit guarantee schemes and
the abandonment of the gold standard, particularly after the Bretton Woods system collapsed in the early
1970s, permitted the transition to our layered fiat currency system. In that system, privately-issued means
of payment in the form of scriptural inside money is valued to the extent that there is sufficient confidence
that it can always be converted in full and upon demand into what has become the foundation of the whole
monetary architecture: unbacked outside money issued, in the form of paper banknotes or electronic
reserves held by commercial banks, by a sovereign or a central bank acting in the public interest.[ ][ ]
Modern central banks now operate within institutional frameworks that prioritise transparency,
independence, and accountability. By relying on these flexible and credible setups, and within the
guardrails of their statutes that mandate them to the pursuit of clear objectives, central banks have
23
24
25
26 27
28
29
30
31 32

acquired and retained the tools for managing the currency in a way that fosters price stability and
balanced growth.
The historical evolution of our monetary system highlights several key lessons. Central banks, by ensuring
standardisation of outside money, trust in its value, and fungibility, provide an important public good: price
stability as the prerequisite for macroeconomic stability. At the same time, inside money enhances the
efficiency of the monetary system by addressing practical challenges, leveraging technological
innovations, and meeting the liquidity and transaction needs of complex economies. The lesson of history
is that inside money is best safeguarded through regulation and supervision of banks, the provision of
deposit insurance and the willingness of the central bank to act as the lender of last resort in the event of a
systemic liquidity crisis. In summary, an optimal combination of both inside money and outside money
creates an efficient and resilient monetary system that can adapt to changing technological and economic
conditions while maintaining stability and public trust in the currency.
CBDC as a robust response to digitalisation
This evolution has brought us to the stable two-tier monetary system that I highlighted earlier. Central bank
money serves as the monetary anchor: the central bank has full sovereignty over monetary policy; all
forms of commercial bank money are convertible at par with central bank money; and payments can be
made with both inside and outside money.
We are now witnessing a profound technological revolution that is reshaping economies worldwide.
Naturally, as has always been the case, money will adapt to these shifts. I am referring to three trends in
particular.
First, the increasing digitalisation of our economy is changing payment methods and behaviours. For
instance, e-commerce now accounts for around one third of non-recurring payments in the euro area.
Similarly, e-payment solutions (e-payment wallets and mobile apps) are gaining traction, growing at
double-digit rates.[ ] These developments highlight the diminishing role of physical banknotes as a means
of payment in an increasingly digital world.[ ]
Second, entirely new forms of financial assets are emerging in in the wake of this digital transformation.
Decentralised finance applications and crypto-assets such as bitcoin aim to bypass traditional financial
intermediation. Of particular relevance as a medium of exchange are stablecoins. The proponents of
stablecoins seek to combine the advantages of distributed ledger technologies with a stable conversion
rate into traditional currencies. By contrast, crypto-assets such as bitcoin are not well suited to performing
the medium of exchange function due to high price volatility and an incapacity to process high volumes of
transactions at speed.
Third, digital ecosystems – platforms such as Alibaba and Alipay that integrate proprietary forms of money
with other services – are creating closed environments that encourage consumers to remain within
specific systems.[ ]
33

35

These technological advances offer opportunities, such as a more efficient and innovative financial
system, but also pose challenges. These have the potential to disrupt the delicate balance of the two-tier
monetary system and could threaten the sovereignty of central banks over monetary policy. Taking a
forward-looking perspective is crucial because network effects heavily influence how money and payment
systems evolve. The more widely a form of money or payment application is used, the more attractive it
becomes to others – a dynamic that can entrench suboptimal developments if these take hold. For
instance, once the adoption of a payment system or a communication app reaches a certain threshold,
people tend to continue using it because others are also using it, which makes it more convenient but also
“locks in” users. At that point, reversing the adoption trend becomes exceedingly difficult.
It follows that we need to anticipate this type of development and be prepared if it materialises, because
our responsibility is to ensure that the foundations of a monetary system that has proved its value are
preserved for the future. I would like to explore the three trends that I have just identified in more detail
and understand their implications. Those trends are likely to occur simultaneously and to various degrees,
and are likely to interact with each other. Nevertheless, to simplify the analysis, let me analyse these
trends one by one.
A decreasing use of banknotes by the public
Within an ever-expanding digital economy, there is an increasing share of online transactions. The ECB
remains committed to continue providing physical cash in the future and ensuring cash acceptance
throughout the euro area. At the same time, the more transactions are made online, the lower the
possibility for consumers to pay with physical banknotes, which are the legal tender and – together with
their electronic counterparts, the central-bank-issued euro reserves held by banks – constitute the current
form of central bank money.[ ] This is obviously a natural technological progression, but it raises profound
questions about the role of central bank money and the stability of the monetary system.
Will monetary policy remain effective and the monetary system cohesive if that trend continues?
Traditionally, cash has played a critical role in maintaining trust in the convertibility of commercial bank
money into central bank money and supporting effective monetary policy. Cash issued by the central bank
acts as a “glue” and vivid reminder that all forms of money – whether commercial bank deposits or other
forms of inside money – owe their wide acceptance in commerce to their convertibility into central bank
money at par. This possibility of convertibility fosters trust in the value of deposits and helps to contain the
“information sensitivity” of commercial bank money to a minimum, such that transactions of goods and
services are fluid and unhampered by a constant need to verify the standing of the means of payment
offered in exchange.
Conversely, the absence of such a monetary anchor could slow down and fragment the web of daily
transactions that form the modern-day multi-trillion payment system. In addition to fostering trust, having
public access to central bank money serves as a disciplining mechanism, providing a reliable fallback
option to using commercial bank money.[ ] In turn, the option of using central bank money for payments
limits the scope for commercial payment systems to exploit monopoly power to charge excessive payment
36
37

fees.[ ] As the share of online transactions increases, the extent to which the option to make payments in
cash can act as a disciplinary tool against market power decreases.
The convertibility stipulation that lies at the foundation of our layered monetary system necessitates that
commercial banks are granted access to central bank money in sufficient amounts to always be able to
convert deposits into banknotes upon demand. As noted earlier, the central bank creates reserves – an
electronic form of cash that can only be held by commercial banks – by making loans to the banks or by
purchasing assets. Together with the interest rates charged on loans to banks, the interest rate paid on the
reserves held by banks is the lever through which a modern central bank influences interest rates across
the financial system, thereby affecting monetary conditions across the economy.[ ]
Without positive demand for central bank money, this link would weaken or disappear, undermining the
ability of the central bank to guide monetary conditions. As inflation is determined over the medium term
by monetary policy, dwindling demand for central bank money could threaten the control of the monetary
authority over inflation and risk price indeterminacy.[ ]
Even if there was zero demand for banknotes and the general public did not directly hold money issued by
the central bank, there would still be demand from commercial banks for the electronic cash (reserves)
issued by the central bank in order to have sufficient liquidity to cope with high and volatile volumes of
interbank payments and to be in a position to meet deposit withdrawal requests.[ ] In principle, under
normal conditions, the central bank could continue to deliver price stability by raising or lowering the
interest rates paid on the reserve deposits held by commercial banks and the interest rates charged to
supply extra reserves through making loans to commercial banks.
However, if the general public did not directly hold central bank money, an important and historic
safeguard would no longer be available, namely the ability of firms and households to make direct
payments in central bank money – banknotes. Moreover, the absence of a default central bank payments
option that sits outside the commercial banking system could also endanger the capacity of the central
bank to deliver price stability, especially under stressed conditions. In particular, if the payments system
were to be totally dependent on the soundness of commercial banks, this would further raise the stakes in
scenarios in which liquidity provision to commercial banks might run against the appropriate monetary
policy stance. In summary, while the private incentives of individual commercial banks and the array of
safeguards discussed above go a long way in underpinning monetary stability, the weakening of the
effective capacity of the general public to transact in central bank money directionally increases risk in the
monetary system.
Stablecoins as a medium of exchange
What are the challenges facing our monetary system in an era of rapid technological change? Intuitively,
distributed ledger technologies can provide the technological platform for a decentralised system in which
private issuers could offer to settle transactions in secure and apparently “information insensitive” forms of
money outside traditional central bank systems. For example, bearer-based stablecoins – digital
38
39
40
41

representations of private electronic banknotes that are designed to be backed by safe assets such as
government bonds or bank deposits – could bypass settlement via central bank reserves altogether,
thereby creating a monetary ecosystem that flies under the radar of central bank oversight.[ ]
In particular, central bank money would play a much-diminished role in the payments system, if
households and firms were to maintain their primary transaction accounts in stablecoins and only use
commercial bank accounts to upload and download funds from these transaction accounts.[ ] In a sense,
a stablecoin provider would resemble a so-called narrow bank that only holds high quality liquid assets
and promises to maintain a stable value of its liabilities (the funds held by customers in their stablecoin
accounts). While the pros and cons of narrow banking have been much debated over the decades, a
material decline in the volume of deposits held in commercial banks would disrupt the role of commercial
banks in credit provision, which is especially prominent in the bank-based European financial system.
Moreover, even if stablecoins were fully backed by deposits in the commercial banking system (that is the
stablecoin provider would match stablecoin liabilities with deposit assets), these deposits would effectively
constitute “wholesale” deposits rather than “retail” deposits, resulting in a lower liquidity coverage ratio
(LCR).[ ]
Indeed, stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or pool of
assets, have already gained a significant foothold in the crypto-asset universe.[ ][ ] Their appeal lies in
their ease of use and innovative features and in the possibility for fast, low-cost transactions.[ ] While
stablecoins play a central role in settling transactions in other crypto assets, it is clear that stablecoins are
also attracting interest in the facilitating low-cost cross-border transactions in the “traditional” economy and
financial system.
In particular, despite significant technological progress, cross-border trade between countries remains to
this day costly and inefficient, with large-value payments going through the correspondent banking
network, which can take days to settle. There are unrealised positive network externalities, which are
particularly evident to companies that maintain global supply chains.[ ] Subject to being credibly backed
by high-quality liquid assets, stablecoins can acquire a degree of global acceptability in wholesale
transactions that can, in principle, address the inefficiencies that merchants face when making large cross-
border payments through banks.
At the same time, as these digital assets continue to evolve and gather pace, one has to carefully assess
their potential spillovers for domestic retail payments and consider the implications for the monetary
system more broadly. In particular, as noted earlier, an equilibrium could emerge in which households and
firms maintain transaction accounts with stablecoin providers, causing bank deposits and banknotes to
lose relevance as a medium of exchange. Indeed, it is possible to imagine workers receiving salary
payments in stablecoins (or immediately transferring salary payments from bank deposits to stablecoin
accounts).
Let’s consider two potential situations.
42
43
44
45 46
47
48

To start, imagine a situation in which euro-based stablecoins assert themselves as new dominant players.
Imagine the pool of safe assets backing the stablecoins being directly or indirectly backed by the reserve
accounts of commercial banks with the Eurosystem. These new instruments would essentially represent a
novel form of inside money within our euro-based monetary system. Their strength would lie in their
accessibility and transferability, potentially increasing the efficiency of the monetary system, especially in
cross-border transactions or in facilitating so-called smart contracts.[ ] Unlike traditional money market
funds, such stablecoins could seamlessly serve as both savings and payment instruments.[ ] Critically,
the ultimate nature of the two-layered system I was describing before would be preserved, with euro
reserves issued by the Eurosystem providing the foundation of the new monetary order: the commercial
banks that stablecoin providers deposit their funds with would need to hold larger reserve accounts to
accommodate withdrawal requests from the stablecoin provider.
Still, a two-layer monetary architecture in which “inside money” transactions are dominated by stablecoins
rather than by commercial banks would pose new challenges. First, the new form of money would be less
“information insensitive” than the inside money created in the current institutional environment. The reason
for this is essentially inadequate regulation and supervision. Recent experience has shown that, given the
regulatory and supervisory vacuum in which these operate, some stablecoins can fail to maintain their
intended stability, deviating (sometimes in dramatic fashion) from par value with their underlying reference
asset.[ ] While this risk would be minimal if the assets backing stablecoins were exclusively composed of
deposits in the commercial banking system, stablecoin providers would naturally be tempted to hold
higher-yielding but riskier securities in their asset portfolio. If the conversion rate between inside money –
the stablecoins – and the anchoring asset can change, it is up to the holder and the payee in a transaction
to verify whether parity holds. This process is costly and prone to changes in sentiment. A change in
sentiment about the capacity of the issuer to redeem the stablecoins at par could lead to systemic shocks
and runs of the sort seen in the era of free banking, when private banks were given the authority to issue
their own currency backed by Treasury bonds.[ ] In summary, while the “moneyness” of stablecoins relies
on one-to-one convertibility into currency, this promise carries less credibility for stablecoin providers,
which do not perform bank-like tasks such as credit provision to the economy and are not supervised or
back-stopped by the central bank.
Second, as funds shift towards these new instruments, the stability of the financial system could be
affected. At least part of the asset pool providing collateral for the stablecoins would be in the form of bank
deposits.[ ] However, as indicated above, this recycling of household and firm deposits back into the
banking sector would only partially compensate the losses that banks would suffer in the first place as
those cheap and more stable deposits migrate to the stablecoins domain. This shift would increase bank
funding costs and negatively affect credit supply. Additionally, large stablecoin issuers would likely
concentrate their holdings in safer, more liquid banks, further intensifying the effects for other banks in the
economy. As stablecoin-managed assets grow, competition for liquid resources would increase their
scarcity and price, resulting in still-higher costs for banks to maintain their buffers of liquid assets.

A second scenario imagines a new world with an increasing prevalence of stablecoins that are effectively
backed by assets denominated in a foreign currency.[ ] Given that the majority of existing stablecoins are
linked to the US dollar, this is not a purely hypothetical scenario.[ ] At some level, dollar stablecoins make
it easier for European households to acquire low-risk dollar assets (typically, it is not easy to open a dollar
bank account for European residents). The macro-financial implications of lower frictions in international
capital mobility are well understood, both in “normal” times and “crisis” times. However, the open question
is whether dollar stablecoins could also gain a foothold in domestic transactions in the euro area, whereby
the domestic payments system becomes directly or indirectly anchored by the dollar rather than the euro.
[ ][ ]
While the likelihood of this scenario is hard to quantify, a full risk assessment warrants inspection of even
tail-type scenarios. A growing prevalence of digital dollarisation would undermine monetary sovereignty by
compromising the ability to control the unit of account within its jurisdiction. This means the domestic
currency would risk losing its status as the dominant currency for expressing prices and settling most
trades. Although ‘dominant’ lacks a precise defining threshold, as the share of transactions settled in the
domestic currency decreases, the capacity of the central bank to implement effective monetary policy and
maintain price stability is significantly impaired.[ ] For the euro area, the erosion of monetary sovereignty
would also have a historic symbolic meaning. Such an erosion would affect the euro as a symbol of
European identity and the perceived cohesion of the entire monetary system.[ ]
Platform-based payment systems
The challenges and risks associated with a potential fading role of currencies anchored in a public function
are amplified if one considers the closed and captive environments in which private digital alternatives are
sometimes created. Many privately-issued forms of digital money are offered within ecosystems that are
designed to generate such powerful network effects as to make it difficult for users to seek alternatives.[ ]
By bundling payments with other services and restricting interoperability, platforms can establish so-called
walled gardens, leveraging network effects to lock in users and making the loss of convenience or the cost
of leaving the platform prohibitively high.[ ] Transaction accounts would be reduced to a “club good”
offered in return for the payment of a fee or membership of a platform. In addition to the loss of monetary
sovereignty, if combined with monetisation of payment data, such a scenario would entail the build-up of
market power imbalances, inefficiencies and, ultimately, an unprecedented degradation of a competition-
based economy.[ ][ ]
The digital euro as a robust policy response
The trends I have outlined highlight the potential for technological innovation to disrupt monetary
transmission, monetary sovereignty, the singleness of money, and the welfare and fairness of society.
Central banks have a mandate to safeguard monetary stability in all circumstances. This responsibility

calls for a cautious yet forward-looking approach, ensuring we are ready to address challenges and
forestall risks before they materialise.
A powerful and forward-looking response to these challenges lies in the issuance of a digital euro – a
digital form of cash that would be available to the general public. Following a prudent risk management
approach, introducing a digital euro would minimise the likelihood of adverse economic outcomes in the
future and ensure the resilience of our monetary system in an increasingly digital world.
In a scenario in which the use of physical cash declines substantially, the digital euro can preserve public
access to “information insensitive” central bank money and protect the capacity of the central bank to
deliver its macroeconomic mandate in a digital world.
The digital euro is also an effective tool to limit the dominance of foreign digital currencies, including the
monetary sovereignty risks created by widely-adopted foreign-currency stablecoins.[ ] Furthermore, in a
world dominated by platform-based payment systems, where payments are bundled with other services in
closed ecosystems, a digital euro would provide an open and interoperable alternative, preventing the
fragmentation and limited interoperability of money. A digital euro could help to ensure a socially optimal
level of data protection and would enable citizens to transact in the digital economy while enjoying the
privacy benefits associated with cash.[ ] With appropriate design features, the digital euro can deliver
these benefits without destabilising financial institutions or disrupting monetary policy implementation or
transmission. For example, appropriately calibrated limits on digital euro holdings can prevent excessive
outflows from commercial banks while still providing individuals with access to secure digital money.[ ]
In essence, issuing the digital euro is not just about adapting to technological change. It is about
safeguarding the core principles that underpin our monetary system – stability, trust, and inclusivity – in an
era of rapid transformation.
Securing the future of the euro area: the strategic importance of the
digital euro
The special case of a monetary union
For the multi-country euro area, the benefits of a CBDC are more extensive compared to the calculus for
an individual nation state with its own currency. It addresses challenges unique to our monetary union,
while strengthening the position of the euro in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical world.
In particular, let me now turn my attention to the domestic payments system in the euro area. The
payments system is multi-layered: a customer might pay her mortgage, rent and utilities bills by direct
debit from her account but will typically use a card or e-wallet for electronic transactions in-store or online.
In this multi-layered system, the customer pre-loads funds onto a card or into an e-wallet, or has a line of
credit (as with a credit card).[ ] These cards and e-wallets offer many advantages but also pose some
risks, especially if the intermediaries offering cards and e-wallets are not European.
64

Against this backdrop, the digital euro presents a unique opportunity to overcome the persistent
fragmentation in retail payment systems across the euro area. Unlike single-nation currency systems, the
monetary union faces distinct challenges due to diverse legacy national standards and a non-unified retail
payment system.[ ] This fragmentation has led to a shortage of pan-European payment options, creating
barriers for customers and businesses engaging in cross-border transactions within the euro area.[ ]
While some of these frictions are so embedded to the point of near-invisibility from the point of view of
many households, it is not cost free that customers must generally rely on non-European card or e-wallet
providers to make payments across the euro area, with the partial exceptions of some domestic-only or
regional card/e-wallet schemes in some countries or if a customer and a merchant happen to both have
accounts with a particular fintech firm.
This has inadvertently strengthened the dominance of foreign companies in our payments landscape,
especially for card payments, which currently account for the majority of retail payment transactions by
value.[ ] This fragmented landscape undermines competition, limits consumer choice, drives up costs and
restricts the ability of the euro area to fully harness the advantages of digitalisation for its citizens and
businesses.[ ][ ]
By mandating acceptance of the digital euro (by extending the legal tender status of banknotes to the
digital world), we can create instant network effects that unify our fragmented market. Moreover, a
standardised, pan-European platform would enable private payment providers to innovate, while benefiting
from economies of scale, ultimately reducing costs for consumers and businesses alike. While, in
principle, an integrated area-wide “fast payment system” (FPS) could alternatively be developed by
forceful regulatory initiatives and highly-coordinated investments across the universe of private payment
providers, this is less feasible in the context of a multi-country monetary union with possibly non-aligned
interests across different legacy payment systems.[ ]
For banks and payment service providers, the digital euro would serve as a catalyst for collaboration. It
provides an economic incentive for these institutions to join forces to build a unified and innovative
payment system that spans all retail use cases – whether peer-to-peer, point-of-sale transactions, or e-
commerce. In particular, by linking customers and merchants across the euro area via the system of digital
euro accounts, card and e-wallet providers could focus on providing additional payment services under
which the underlying payments “travel” via the digital euro system. This unified approach would strengthen
the financial ecosystem of the euro area, enabling it to compete more effectively with large foreign
technology firms by delivering innovative products at scale and at competitive prices.[ ] As a not-for-profit
venture, the digital euro would reduce costs for merchants and businesses, thereby increasing bargaining
power vis-à-vis international card schemes, both for physical stores and in e-commerce.
Importantly, unlike private entities that often monetise payment data for commercial purposes, the digital
euro prioritises user privacy, ensuring that citizens can transact securely in a digital economy without
compromising their privacy.[ ]

Geopolitical considerations
The digital euro would also play a crucial role in strengthening the strategic autonomy of Europe in an
increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape. We are witnessing a global shift towards a more
multipolar monetary system, with payments systems and currencies increasingly wielded as instruments of
geopolitical influence and competing jurisdictions seek to assert their independence from foreign monetary
powers.[ ]
The rise of cryptocurrencies that enable direct, intermediary-free transactions, challenges the traditional
financial system. In addition, China’s development of the digital yuan, the exploration by the BRICS
nations of a platform to link their central bank digital initiatives (the BRICS Bridge), and the mBridge
project, involving China, Thailand, Hong Kong and the UAE exemplify how digital currencies can offer
efficient cross-border payments. These are clear indicators of the ongoing global multipolar monetary
trend.[ ]
In this context, Europe faces significant vulnerabilities. In the absence of attractive pan-European digital
payment solutions, Europe’s reliance on foreign payment providers has reached striking levels.
International card schemes such as Visa and Mastercard now process sixty-five per cent of euro area card
payments. In thirteen out of the twenty euro area countries, national card schemes have been entirely
replaced by these international alternatives.[ ] In addition, mobile app payments, dominated by non-
European tech firms (such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal), now account for nearly a tenth of retail
transactions and are showing double-digit annual growth.
This dependence exposes Europe to risks of economic pressure and coercion and has implications for our
strategic autonomy, limiting our ability to control critical aspects of our financial infrastructure.[ ] When we
rely on international cards, apps or stablecoins, we effectively outsource our payment infrastructure. This
leaves European payments vulnerable to changing terms of use or to service withdrawal threats.[ ] As
discussed in the previous section, these risks could be further compounded by the growing dominance of
foreign technology companies and a potential increase in the holdings of foreign-currency stablecoins.
Currently, ninety-nine per cent of the stablecoin market is linked to the US dollar, and European interest in
these instruments is increasing rapidly.[ ][ ]
The digital euro is a promising solution to counter these risks and ensure the euro area retains control
over its financial future. It would provide a secure, universally-accepted digital payment option under
European governance, reducing reliance on foreign providers. From a strategic perspective, the digital
euro would curtail the risk that domestic-currency stablecoins might gain a significant market share in the
domestic payments system, which would be highly disruptive for the banking system and credit
intermediation. Likewise, the availability of the digital euro would also limit the likelihood of foreign-
currency stablecoins gaining a foothold as a medium of exchange in the euro area.[ ] However, especially
taking into account the power of network externalities, these risks would increase if there were delays in
launching a digital euro.

Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The monetary system – and the currencies within that system – has seen a substantial transformation
over the centuries. This transformation continues today. As societies become increasingly digital, central
banks are exploring the benefits of introducing CBDCs to align with the needs of consumers and keep the
monetary system fit for purpose in the digital age. The case for a CBDC is especially strong for a monetary
union, especially in the context of a fragmented and externally-dependent payments system.
At a time of geopolitical uncertainty and shocks, the euro has maintained its reputation as a strong and
stable currency. Well over three-quarters of citizens in the euro area now support the single currency – a
record high.[ ] And at eighty-nine per cent, Irish support for the euro is among the highest in the euro
area.[ ] However, as technology and the economy evolve, we need to ensure that we retain the monetary
autonomy to preserve monetary stability under all circumstances.
The digital euro is not just about making sure our monetary system adapts to the digital age. It is about
ensuring that Europe controls its monetary and financial destiny, against a backdrop of increasing
geopolitical fragmentation.

An RTGS (real-time gross settlement) system is a payment system that facilitates the continuous, real-
time settlement of high-value or time-critical financial transactions on an individual basis. Typically
operated by a central bank, RTGS systems entail settlement in central bank money (each participating
institution has a reserves account at the central bank). The euro area RTGS is known as the T2
(previously Target2) system and is run by the ECB. For a comprehensive introduction to payments

“fedi di credito”, deposit certificates that could be passed on as a decentralised paper means of payment
in central bank money. See Bindseil, U. (2019), Central banking before 1800: a rehabilitation, Oxford

The Bank of England decided to issue “running-cash notes” from its onset, it did not issue banknotes in
fixed denominations until 1725. In Sweden, the Stockholms Banco, a precursor of today’s Sveriges
Riksbank, issued the first banknotes in Europe in 1661. Faced with an outflow of deposits when the fixed
exchange rate between copper and silver was changed in 1661, Stockholms Banco replaced the
cumbersome copper coins with credit notes, i.e. notes issued by the bank with printed and round
denominations that could be transferred to third parties. These notes worked very well initially and became
very popular due to their convenience. They were not linked to any deposit, and their acceptance was
based on the general public's confidence that the bank would pay the value of the note in coins upon
demand. However, demands to redeem the notes led the bank to fail in 1664 and the Council of the Realm
banned the use of the banknotes. Paper money in Sweden was not issued again until 1701 in the form of
Transport notes. See Ögren, A. (2024), "Johan Palmstrüch, a Copper Money Doctor: Stockholm Banco
and the Emergence of Banknotes in Seventeenth Century Sweden." in Money Doctors Around the Globe:

The convenience gain of using banknotes can be illustrated by the bulkiness of some of the coins
circulating at that time. For instance, during the 16th and 17th centuries, Swedish copper coins reached

weights of up to 20 kilogrammes, which was the weight of the 10 daler coin, equivalent to about €1,500 in
today’s money.

The state theory of money or "chartalism” emphasises the role of the state in declaring what constitutes

Woolf in which Keynes criticises the decision made by Winston Churchill, then Chancellor of the

economically unsound and discussed the potential negative consequences, which foreshadow the
eventual crisis of 1931.
31.
The Great Depression was a pivotal event: Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931 and the United
States enacted the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, establishing deposit insurance and an enhanced regulation
and supervision of banks. These moves paved the way to the regime forged in the Bretton Woods
agreements. By combining the anchor of the gold standard and the flexibility of the adjustable rate regime,
that system provided monetary and macroeconomic stability. However, the lack of credible enforcement
incentives also contributed to its relatively short-lived nature.

The ECB offers several options for banks that wish to borrow from it (on a collateralised basis). The main
refinancing operations (MROs) offer loans on a seven-day basis; the longer-term refinancing operations
(LTROs) offer loans on a 90-day basis; and the marginal lending facility (MLF) offers loans on an
emergency basis at a penalty rate. These facilities are not much used at present: around €7.9 billion is
currently outstanding in the MRO facility, €17 billion in the LTRO facility and just €20 million in the MLF.
When warranted by the prevailing monetary conditions, the ECB has, in the past, also offered very long-

term refinancing operations (VLTROs) and targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). The ECB
does not pay interest on the minimum reserves that must be held by banks in the current account facility
(currently about €188 billion) but does pay interest on the “excess” (above minimum) reserves held by
banks in the deposit facility (currently around €2.81 trillion). This deposit facility rate (DFR) is the rate
through which the ECB steers the monetary policy stance.

In a seminal paper, Woodford (1998) argued that, under specific conditions, monetary policy would remain
effective in a cashless economy (understood as an economy without central bank money). However, the
assumptions and conclusions of his analysis remain fundamentally debated. For instance, Rogers (2006)
critically reviews Woodford’s assumptions and points out conceptual and methodological errors. Moreover,
Rogoff (2014) raises the point that it is not necessarily established that the economy converges to the
same equilibrium with and without central bank money. Lastly, De Grauwe and Storti (2001) argue that the
absence of central bank money would render monetary policy ineffective, thus threatening the capacity of
the central bank to control inflation. However, the academic discussion remains purely theoretical, with
models abstracting from important considerations relevant in practice. See Woodford, M. (1998), “Doing
without money: controlling inflation in a post-monetary world”, Review of Economic Dynamics, Vol. 1,
Issue 1, pp. 173-219; Rogers, C. (2006), “Doing without money: a critical assessment of Woodford’s

A regulatory source of demand for central bank money is imposed via minimum reserve requirements, i.e.
the obligation on banks to hold a certain proportion of their liabilities in the form of electronic or physical
cash. In the euro area, the minimum reserve requirement for banks corresponds to one per cent of
deposits. However, as noted in the main text, banks like to hold substantial amounts of reserves in excess
of the minimum requirement in order to have sufficient liquidity to cope with high and volatile volumes of
interbank payments and to be in a position to meet deposit withdrawal requests.

In truth, there might be several layers in the payments system. A household might upload funds from its
bank account to an e-wallet and in turn use the e-wallet account to buy stablecoins. In reverse, the
proceeds of a sale in stablecoins could be initially lodged in the household’s e-wallet and an additional
step would be required to draw down these funds back to the household’s bank account.

issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and e-money tokens (EMTs). For instance, the draft regulatory
technical standards establish that significant EMTs must always keep at least 60% of the funds received in
deposits with credit institutions, although for significant ARTs that percentage refers to the amount
referenced in each official currency (for ARTs that are not significant, that percentage is 30%, while EMTs
that are not significant are not subject to reserve requirement unless established ad hoc by the

The design of the digital euro ensures that transactions and accounts would remain anonymous to the
Eurosystem. Just as banknotes are sourced via the ATM of a commercial bank, an individual would
maintain a digital euro account with a commercial bank, which would be responsible for “know your
customer” procedures and related checks. See also Garratt, R. J. and Van Oordt, M.R. (2021), “Privacy as

While the implementation of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) in the early 2000s successfully
addressed cross-border payment challenges for credit transfers and direct debits within the euro area, a
similar degree of harmonisation has not been achieved at the retail level. Retail payments remain narrowly
focused on national markets, addressing only specific use cases and lacking the comprehensive reach
needed across the euro area. See, e.g., Cipollone, P. (2024). “Innovation, integration, and independence:
taking the Single Euro Payments Area to the next level”, speech at the ECB conference on “An innovative
and integrated European retail payments market”, Frankfurt am Main, 24 April.

A unified European card scheme was never developed, leaving existing national card schemes non-
interoperable and unable to facilitate cross-border transactions in the euro area. As a result, international
card schemes have become essential for card payments across European borders and increasingly within
national EU markets. These international schemes have expanded beyond their traditional sectors – such
as travel and entertainment – into areas typically served by national card schemes. See Plooij, M. (2020),

role of instant payments therein” Financial Stability Review, Banco de España, Autumn.

For instance, the average net merchant service charges in the EU increased from 0.27% in 2018 to 0.44%

including as regards relevant aspects of the application of the Interchange Fee Regulation – Final Report,
5 February). This increase occurred despite regulatory efforts to contain it, as international card schemes
exploited their strong negotiating position to raise the non-regulated components of the merchant service
charge, such as scheme fees. See also Cipollone, P. (2024), “Monetary sovereignty in the digital age: the

According to Stephan Miran, if the reserve asset is considered the lifeblood of global trade and financial
systems, then whoever controls this reserve asset and currency can exert some degree of control over
trade and financial transactions. Since the US dollar serves as the world’s reserve currency, this enables
the United States to impose its will in foreign and security policy using financial force rather than physical
force. See Miran, S. (2024), A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System, Hudson Bay

Scholarly research suggests that countries are incentivised to digitise their fiat currencies, such as by
launching CBDCs, due to the need to enhance currency adoption in a digital world and to address the
growing competition from private digital money like stablecoins. The decision to digitise currencies is
strategic and a pecking order appears: countries with strong but non-dominant currencies have the highest
incentives and are likely to digitise their currencies first. Those with dominant currencies, like the United
States, follow next in response to competition. By contrast, countries with very weak currencies have little
to gain and may forgo digitisation. Although competition from private digital money can hinder digitisation,
rivalry among fiat currencies actually speeds it up. For further details, see Cong, L. and Mayer, S. (2022),
