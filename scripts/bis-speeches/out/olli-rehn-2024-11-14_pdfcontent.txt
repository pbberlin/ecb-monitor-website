1/2 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Olli Rehn: Disinflation on track amid geopolitical uncertainty
Remarks by Mr Olli Rehn, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the UBS European 
Conference, London, 12 November 2024.
* * *
Let me first thank UBS for kindly inviting me to address this distinguished audience. To 
kick off, I will briefly discussthe economic outlook in the euro area and the ECB's 
monetary policy approach.
Overall, it is fair to say that the ECB's monetary policy has been relatively successful in 
taming . Rate hikes have helped keep inflation expectations anchored to  inflation
around 2%. Somewhat unusually for a tightening cycle, the euro area appears to have 
avoided recession, and unemployment has stayed at a record low. The ECB's inflation 
target was revised in 2021, and the revised symmetric target of 2% over the medium 
term has worked well during the past poly-crisis years.
The big picture now is that disinflation in the euro area remains well on track. In 
October, inflation stood exactly at 2%, and it is expected to stabilise more sustainable 
next year. The progress with disinflation has prompted us to make three 25 bp. rate 
cuts since June.
Even though a soft landing seems plausible in the euro area,is projected to  growth 
remain sluggish. The manufacturing sector, in particular, is underperforming, not least 
in Germany but also elsewhere.
What does this imply going forward? As you may be aware, we  for monetary policy 
have been preaching and practising data-dependency.
So, I am indeed looking forward to our December broad macroeconomic projections, 
especially on two issues.
Will the projections indicate that inflation is stabilizing at our 2% target in early 2025 
already? Will they confirm the weakening of growth momentum?
As for the ECB's monetary policy stance, we are approaching a neutral level of interest 
rates – although nobody knows this will be reached. The of  exactly when   direction 
rate changes is clear, but the of rate cuts will depend on our overall  speed and scope 
assessment at each meeting of : the outlook, the dynamics of three factors  inflation   
inflation and the strength of monetary policy .underlying   transmission
The question in the title of the panel – How far and how fast do we move in reversing 
– can also be tackled by scrutinising the natural rate of interest, r*. the tightening cycle? 
R* provides a meaningful analytical framework for thinking about monetary policy, 
although its estimates are highly uncertain and it is, therefore, not a concrete 
policymaking tool. Unlike academics, we policymakers don't have the privilege to simply 
say that r* cannot be measured – we need an educated guesstimate.

2/2 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Generally, estimates of r* for the euro area are now slightly above zero, between 0 and 
1. The Bank of Finland researchers estimate it to be in the range of 0.2% to 0.8%. This 
is in the same ballpark, if somewhat above, as the New York Fed's estimate of r* for the 
euro area, made with its broadly recognized Holston-Laubach-Williams model.1
Against this backdrop, current market data and simple (or simplified) maths seem to 
imply that we would leave restrictive territory sometime in the springwinter next year 
2025. But that is just an observation from my side, not a commitment. My commitment 
is instead to our inflation target and reaction function, as discussed earlier.
Before concluding, one final point. Geopolitics, especially Russia's illegal war in 
Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East and China's strategic ambitions, is 
overshadowing the economic outlook in Europe. It is also seriously affecting the 
operational environment for monetary policy – and will probably continue to do so for 
years, if not decades.
So far, we have witnessed a certain retreat but not a broad-based reversal of 
globalization. The specifics of US trade policy under the incoming new administration 
are still unknown, but what we do know is that the significant import duties spoken of 
could have detrimental ramifications for the world economy. What should we make of all 
this?
First, a new trade war is the last thing we need amid today's geopolitical rivalries – 
especially among allies. If a trade war were to start, Europe must not be unprepared, as 
it was in 2018.
Second, the political turmoil in Germany and France underscores the importance of the 
European Commission in providing leadership and direction for Europe.
The Eurosystem must, within its mandate, act as an anchor for economic and financial 
stability in this landscape of great challenges. No one should doubt that we will shoulder 
this responsibility in full.
Thank you very much for your attention!
I look forward to the panel discussion.
