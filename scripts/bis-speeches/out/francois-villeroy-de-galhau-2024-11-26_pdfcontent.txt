Ladies and Gentlemen,  
今日,皆様とご一緒できて光栄です [I am honoured to be with you today]. It is a 
great pleasure to attend this Paris Europlace summit in Tokyo with my colleague 
and friend Governor Ueda . I also wish to thank Jean- Charles Simon for the 
invitation and the Embassy of France for hosting this gathering.  I would like to 
take this opportunity to give you an update on the economic outlook in France 
and in Europe, and emphasise the uncertainty that surrounds our horizons (I). I 
will then discuss how central banks can foster innovation ( II), which is key to 
unlocking productivity and growth. 
 
I. Europe and France remain resilient despite uncertainty 
Let me start with an update on the economic situation in Europe and in France.  
 
Inflation stood exactly at our target of 2.0% in October in the euro area, and fell 
below 2% for the second month in a row in France (1.6%), slowing down faster 
than initially expected.i In the euro area, September ECB projections anticipate 
inflation to average 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. But markets expect inflation 
to fall to below 2% already in 2025; and based on the latest actual data, it could 
already be sustainably at 2% early 2025.  When it comes  to activity, Europe’s 
economy remains resilient. Growth was positive in Q3 2024 at 0.4% in the euro 
area as well as in France. According to our latest forecasts, GDP should grow 
by 0.8% in the euro area and 1.1% for France in 2024. In my country, two pieces 
of good economic news are making a positive contribution to this resilience: the 


Page 2 sur 5 
 
long-term effect of disinflation, which boosts real income; and the temporary 
impact for Q3 2024, of the success of the Olympic Games hosted by Paris.  
This “Parisian m omentum” extends to financial services. For the fifth year 
running, France has been Europe’s most attractive country for foreign  
investment.ii More specifically, the steady rise in exports of financial services 
since 2020 has resulted in a positive net balance, reflecting  partly the growing 
attractiveness of Paris as a financial centre. A new law adopted in June 2024 
and promoted by former MP Alexandre Holroyd, is further boosting our 
competitiveness. It brings several improvements, to facilitate new public listings 
and to support trade finance, to name just two. The ACPR, the French banking 
and insurance regulator, remains strongly committed to pursuing an open 
dialogue and facilitating the implementation of innovative projects in Paris.  
I would now like to discuss one takeaway from this economic outlook and 
emphasise one important caveat. First, and this is excellent news, t he victory 
against inflation in Europe is in sight.  Let me stress that the latest rise in 
negotiated wages in Q3 (+5.4%) is a somewhat backward looking indicator, 
mainly driven by the lagged effects of past negotiations in Germany. And it was 
already taken into account in our September projections
. The balance of risks 
on growth and inflation is indeed shifting to the downside, and possible US tariffs 
are not expected to alter significantly the inflation outlook in Europe. Based on 
this assessment, our Governing Council decided on October 17 to lower the 
deposit facility rate by 25 basis points to 3.25%. This was the third cut in interest 
rates, and it will not be the last. Looking forward, the path is clear in my view – 
we should continue to reduce the degree of monetary policy restriction. But the 
pace must be determined by an agile pragmatism: we maintain full optionality 
for our upcoming meetings. By the way, this monetary easing creates favourable 
conditions for the fiscal consolidation which is needed in many countries 
including France. 
And now for my caveat: like the fishermen tossed around by the “Great Wave 
off Kanagawa” by the famous Japanese artist Hokusai, our two economies are 
navigating increasingly uncertain waters. Frank Knightiii (1921) famously coined 

Page 3 sur 5 
 
the difference between risks, which are measurable and hence hedgeable, 
and uncertainty, with unknown probabilities and outcome. Today’s world is more 
and more “Knighti an”iv, while  uncertainty negatively affects investment 
decisionsv as well as household consumption.  
In the wake of the US presidential election, the world economy may be further 
confronted with an  adverse fragmentation. At the international level, this calls 
for greater cooperation between like -minded jurisdictions to deliver on 
existential global public goods such as financial stability in the face of increased 
global debt or ecological transition to address climate change, to name just two 
of them. Europe and Japan believe in an open multilateralism based on 
internationally agreed  standards. In particular, we must reaffirm our strong 
commitment to ensure a level playing field between different jurisdictions and, 
consequently, a fair application of Basel III  standards that are essential 
safeguards for the stability of the international monetary and financial system.  
 
II. Innovation and central banks 
Innovation is the primary explanation for the widening gap in GDP growth 
between Europe and the United States, with the cumulated increase of GDP per 
capita reaching 26% between 1999 and 2023, compared with 39% in the United 
States.  
 
The Draghi report recently gave its thorough diagnosis: too slow innovation, 
insufficient investment in ICT and too low productivity.

First, central banks can contribute to an innovation-conducive environment. This 
starts with our mandate to maintain price sta bility. Our commitment to bring 
inflation back durably to 2% in Europe  underpins household and business 
confidence, and helps ensure a low cost of financing , which is a necessary 
condition for innovation to thrive.  
While preserving their independence and making clear that they are not the 
decision-makers in this field, central banks in Europe can also have a supportive 
role.vi They can provide their insights and expertise  to governments regarding 
structural economic challenges, which includes innovation policies that are vital 
to foster future growth and productivity . In today’s Europe and today’s world, 
non-monetary action is both more necessary and more difficult than ever , due 
to the weakening of governments in many countries. W e, as central bankers,  
will for example continue with President Lagarde to advocate the Draghi and 
Letta reports. 
Second, central banks are supporting innovation through their own projects. Let 
me focus today on our progress regarding central bank digital currencies  
(CBDCs) through two distinct spaces.  
Starting with the retail space, like the Bank of Japan  with the yen , the 
Eurosystem is preparing for a digital euro. This new form of public money would 
be comparable to a “digital banknote” : it would be accepted everywhere i n the 
euro area, with a high level of privacy and free of charge for individuals. It would 
be distributed by banks and other private intermediaries, therefore preserving 
financial intermediation. Private pan-European projects, such as the European 
Payments Initiative (EPI),  could take advantage of its open and harmonised 
standards. In this sense, the digital euro would help overcome the fragmentation 
of payment solutions in Europe.   
In the wholesale space, the Banque de France has been a pioneer in exploring 
the use of CBDC in various settlement processes,  launching an ambitious 
experimental programmevii as early as 2020. In 2024,  thanks to our initiative, 
this work broadened with an extensive exploratory program me within the 
Eurosystem. Since its launch in May, the Eurosystem has been testing three 

Page 5 sur 5 
 
interoperable solutions viii for large tokenised payments transactions and for 
settling tokenised financial assets using central bank money. Such work is 
crucial in a quickl y evolving landscape, where traditional infrastructures are 
likely to coexist with new DLT systems. The euro area could later build a shared 
ledger, understood as a shared utility platform where tokenised financial 
instruments, tokenised settlement assets (CBDC and tokenised commercial 
bank money, or tokenised deposits), and potentially a digital euro, could coexist. 
 
At a global level, Project Agorá  is bringing together private financial firms and 
central banks (including the Bank of Japan and the Banque de France as the 
Eurosystem’s representative), for making this vision a reality.

Let me conclude this speech on a musical note by telling you how delighted we 
are to welcome  back in a few days the renowned Japanese pianist Junko 
Okazaki to the Bank of France.  Ms Okazaki is regularly invited to play at the 
Bank – she notably gave a concert in our Galerie Dorée for the 150th anniversary 
of the French-Japanese relations in 2008. She is a living testimony of the fruitful 
interaction between our two countries, be it at the cultural or financial level. In 
today’s Knightian world, rest assured that we, central bankers,  will do our part, 
in close cooperation,  as “anchors” of confidence, to reduce uncertainty and  
promote innovation. Rather than paralysing us, uncertainty should prompt us to 
accelerate our structural transformation s.ご清聴ありがとうございました
