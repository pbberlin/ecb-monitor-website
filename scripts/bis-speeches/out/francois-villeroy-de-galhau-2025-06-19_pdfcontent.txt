Ladies and Gentlemen, 
I am delighted to participate in this latest edition of the Paris Finance Forum, 
and I would like to warmly thank Augustin de Romanet and Jean-Charles Simon 
for their invitation. This year, Paris has once again demonstrated its vibrancy by 
climbing to fourth place in the OFEXi ranking of global financial centres. The fact 
remains, however, that this has been an unprecedented year, both for the global 
economy and for finance. I propose taking solace in the words of the German 
poet Hölderlin: “where there is danger, a rescuing element grows as well”.ii I will 
outline three threats (1) before inviting us to take three winning gambles (2). 
1) A pivotal year with a combination of three threats 
1.1. (Geo)political unpredictability 
The first threat is clearly (geo)political unpredictability, amplified this year by the 
shift in US policy.  
 
From an economic standpoint, the global outlook – primarily in the United States 
– has been significantly weakened by the new US administration’s shift towards 
protectionism and its persistent unpredictability. But  it is also undermining 
financial stability, causing exceptionally high short-term volatility, particularly in 
US bond markets , which have failed to play their traditional safe -haven role. 
Confidence in the dollar as an international reserve currency could be eroded ,iii 
while the international role of the euro could be fostered as clearly explained by 
Christine Lagarde in Berlin a fortnight ago. 
In this volatile environment, the ECB is a pillar of stability, having successfully 
normalised its monetary policy over the past year with eight successive cuts to 
short-term rates. I expressed this wish back in January, when our rates were 
still at 3%, that we would return to 2% by the summer. Since last Thursday, we 


Page 2 of 7 
 
have been in the favourable “2 and 2” zone, with inflation forecast at 2% this 
year – which is our target – and our key rate at 2%, well below the US and UK 
levels of 4.25%. But in such an uncertain environment, this favourable zone 
does not mean a comfortable zone or a static zone : we will remain pragmatic  
and data-driven, and as agile as necessary. 
1.2. Technological disruptions 
The second threat comes from technological transformations in the financial 
sector. These developments create as many vulnerabilities as they do 
opportunities, particularly in two critical areas: crypto -assets and artificial 
intelligence (AI).  
Crypto-assets are back in the spotlight, particularly stablecoins, which are 
mostly backed by  the US dollar iv and strongly promoted by the new US 
administration.  
 
They pose a serious risk of a “de-Europeanisation” and privatisation of the 
currency,v they currently have no robust federal framework in the United States 
and expose their users and the financial system to numerous financial risks. The 
development of AI is a decisive boost for productivity – whose gains can be 
estimated at between 0.3 and 1% per year –; but it may also contribute to the 
amplification of financial vulnerabilities. For example, AI market concentration 
could increase the risk of dependence on third party players . The use of the 
same types of tools could also amplify herd behaviour, resulting in greater 
volatility and procyclicality. 
1.3. Disintermediation of the financial system  
The third threat stems from developments in the financial system itself. Two -
thirds of financial sector growth since 2008 has come from non -bank financial 


Page 3 of 7 
 
intermediation (NBFI),vi which now account s for nearly 50% of global financial 
assetsvii. 
 
This development could help diversify the sources of financing for the European 
economy. However, in recent years, several episodes have highlighted the 
vulnerabilities associated with NBFI: too opaque, highly interlinked, sometimes 
too leveraged. First, hedge funds, whose use of leverage is rising in Europe and 
the United States  currently account for more than 50% of transactions in the 
secondary European government deb t market. While they can contribute to 
boosting market liquidity, they can potentially also amplify volatility in the event 
of tensions. Another area of vigilance  is growth in private credit: in 2024, total 
assets under management in Europe reached EUR  430 billion, compared with 
EUR 150 billion in 2014 .viii Banks’ exposure to these private funds remains 
difficult to accurately assess for supervisors, and sometimes even the banks  
themselves, due to the opacity of the market and the multiple layers of leverage 
in the ecosystem.  
2) Three winning gambles? 
I want to turn now to three paradoxical gambles. Gambles because we haven’t 
won yet and our game is not yet up to scratch. And paradoxical because they 
require shaking off our form of collective stupefaction, in order to transform these 
emerging threats into opportunities.  
2.1. Regulation can help innovation to go hand in hand with stability 
The first gamble is that well-tailored regulation can help to innovation go hand 
in hand with stability. This is only an oxymoron in appearance : without trust, 
innovation can only be temporary; without innovation, financial stability is just 


Page 4 of 7 
 
stasis. Crypto-assets are a good illustration of this. France and Europe were 
pioneers in the field, with the creation of the DASP statusix in 2019, followed by 
the adoption of a harmonised European framework based around the MiCA 
Regulation.x MiCA is a decisive step forward: it supports the secure and lasting 
development of tokenised finance while also help ing to regulate dollar -backed 
stablecoins. Their rapid growth, which is set to accelerate further, must not come 
at the expense of European monetary sovereignty.  
Our first response to the rapid development of dollar-backed stablecoins is the 
wholesale central bank digital currency ( CDBC) and the digital euro, which will 
make it possible to maintain central bank money’s key role in the digital world.  
In the interbank arena, the Eurosystem is advocating a tokenised settlement 
offering in central bank money and is working to provide an initial solution to 
banks and financial markets by the start of 2026 , to be followed by further 
stages. These “tokenised bank reserves” will constitute a secure and liquid 
settlement asset for financial players, in a highly dynamic payment universe and 
a financial sector undergoing tokenisation. In the retail arena, the Eurosystem is 
preparing to issue a digital euro . This “digital banknote +” will also reduce our 
dependence on international networks, which account for 66% of card payments 
in the euro area . Its distribution will rely on a “public -private partnership” with 
commercial banks, based on a balanced economic model. 
At the same time , the emergence of euro -backed alternatives – euro 
stablecoins, tokenised deposits, tokenised money -market funds – deserves, in 
collaboration with market participants, increased attention, including with regard 
to their cross -border use. The European authorities must also closely monitor 
the implementation of MiCA and start considering a possible “MiCA 2” regulation 
that takes better account of these sovereignty issues.  
 
Lastly, it is vital that we equip ourselves with adequate monitoring tools and a 
regulatory framework adapted to non-bank finance. In order t o better account 
for the risks posed by interlinkages with the financial sector, the ACPR and the 
Banque de France, together with the AMF, are preparing a pilot systemic stress 
test this year involving banks, insurers and investment funds. This exercise has 

Page 5 of 7 
 
no regulatory implications, but will allow us to better understand the nature of 
the risks and their transmission channels.  It is a first in Europe, where no such 
exercise is being considered in the near term. 
2.2. Europe can benefit from America’s policy shift 
The second paradoxical gamble consists in seizing “Europe’s moment” in 
response to America’s radical policy shift. We have the ability to make this leap, 
provided we have the firm and lasting will to do so. Let’s be frank: we are 
currently falling short of the mark. We’ve got the right diagnosis, with the Draghi 
and Letta reports in 2024, then the strategy laid out by European Commissioner 
Albuquerque in March 2025 . But what we need now to act is a general 
mobilisation, based around 3 imper atives – “3 i’s”,xi or, if you prefer, size 
multiplied by muscle multiplied by speed. 
 
First, we need to better integrate the single market. This means capitalising on 
our size – which is equivalent to that of the United States – by removing internal 
barriers. Second, we need to invest better, giving greater priority to the most 
promising disruptive innovations and avoiding falling into the “middle technology 
trap” highlighted by Jean Tirole .xii To do this, we need to develop Europe’s 
financial muscle through a genuine SIU. Europe lacks neither savings nor loans: 
it does lack secure and liquid assets to attract international investors, and lacks 
capital to finance innovation. Our main priority should therefore be to increase 
equity financing, which amounts to 215%  of GDP in the United States for non -
financial corporations, compared with 88% in the euro area.

In terms of venture capital, five times less funds were raised in the EU than the 
United States between 2013 and 2023. Institutional investors could be brought 
on board for this, taking inspiration from the French TIBI or German WIN 
initiatives,xiii but scaled up to a European level. Pan-European funds could also 
be developed, with a new v ersion of the European Tech Champions Initiative 
(ETCI) of the EIB open to private investors. Finally, we need to innovate faster 
with less bureaucracy. For the financial sector, this means adopting a European 
approach to simplification,xiv consisting in making regulations less complex but 
without eschewing our financial stability objective or the international Basel 
standards: fewer standards but better implementation to make them more 
effective. I welcome the creation of two high -level task forces at the ECB and 
EBA on this issue,xv which are expected to submit concrete proposals later this 
year. 
But to turn these good intentions into action, we need to set a mobilising 
deadline,xvi as Jacques Delors did in the past with 1 January 1993 for the single 
market, and 1 January 1999 for the single currency. It is up to the Commission 
to propose this deadline, but why not 1  January 2028? Whatever the case, we 
need to step things up a gear if we want to emerge from the Trump years on a 
stronger footing and with greater sovereignty. 
2.3. France and Paris are in a stronger position within Europe 
Finally, within Europe, we can take a gamble on France and the Paris financial 
centre. Although our country faces serious economic and fiscal challenges, it 
still has many strengths. Our businesses, from the largest – international leaders 
that rival Germany in number – to the youngest (some 400,000 firms were set 
up in 2024, 30% more than ten years ago). The gross financial savings of French 


Page 7 of 7 
 
citizens, which amount to EUR 64 trillion,xvii placing France’s financial 
institutions among the leading players in Europe . Lastly, the Paris financial 
centre that you represent – for the sixth year in a row France has been ranked 
the most attractive European country for foreign investors, xviii and Paris is now 
the top tech ecosystem in Europe, according to the Global Tech Ecosystem 
Index 2025 ,xix ahead of London, Stockholm and Munich. The Holroyd 
“Attractiveness” lawxx of June 2024 has also strengthened our post -
Brexit competitiveness by facilitat ing new stock market listings and supporting 
the financing of global trade. 
* 
I began with Hölderlin, and I shall conclude with Paul Valéry: “The future is not 
what is going to happen, but what we are going to do”.xxi Over the past ten years, 
we have succeeded in learning  the lessons from the crises and preserv ing 
financial stability. But today, history is accelerating, and Europe and France 
must for their part also move forward with regulation that combines innovation 
with stability, and with a general mobilisation that constructs the economic and 
financial sovereignty of our  continent. France has the advantage of having 
Europe's leading financial sector. Our country combines both the strength and 
the ambition to seize this moment of acceleration. Thank you.
