“The Savings and Investments
Union: (Finally) turning an idea into
actions”

Ladies and gentlemen,
It gives me great pleasure to speak before you to mark the publication of
the 158th edition of the Revue d’économie financière,  which is devoted
to an essential question: “Where Do Savings Go?” I would like to pay a
friendly tribute to the remarkable work of the AEFR, its President
Pervenche Bérès, and the two coordinators, Marie-Laure Barut-
Etherington and Pierre Bollon. Today, I shall focus on one of the three
main issues they raise: mobilising European savings to support the
European economy. For that, I shall take another look at a project that is
not new but has recently had something of a “makeover”: the Savings
and Investments Union (SIU). To keep it brief, clear and concrete, I shall
start by recalling three stylised facts about European savings and
investment (1), before going on to dispel three doubts (2) and then
proposing five principal levers for finally turning an idea into actions (3).
1.Three stylised facts about European
savings and investment
1.1. Europe does not lack savings or credit, it
lacks equity. 
i

AEFR 11 September 2025
First of all, the euro area has a significant and frequently overlooked
asset: a higher household saving ratio than in the United States – 15.3%
of gross disposable income compared with 10.8% across the Atlantic.
The gap is less stark in financial savings – due to the size of real estate
savings in Europe – but the main problem is how these financial savings
are allocated: they are predominantly invested in low-risk assets and far
less in shares or investment funds. Europe has a wealth of savings but it
lacks equity capital, which is vital to enable firms to innovate due to the
higher associated risk. Non-financial corporation (NFC) equity financing
amounts to just 85% of GDP in the euro area, compared with 220% of
GDP in the United States. Conversely, euro area NFCs have higher levels
of debt.
1.2. Europe does not lack investment, it lacks
productive investment, and above all
innovative investment

AEFR 11 September 2025
As a share of GDP, total investment   in the euro area is almost the same
as in the United States. However, productive investment (excluding
investment in construction) is much lower in the euro area (10.5% of GDP
compared with 14.3%). In innovative investment in particular – calculated
as the sum of investment in ICT, software, databases and research and
development – the gap between the two countries was already
significant in 2020 (8.8% of GDP compared with 5.1%), and it has since
continued to widen.
1.3. A “European” puzzle: a surplus of financial
savings but a high cost of equity

AEFR 11 September 2025
For more than a decade, Europe has had a net financial savings surplus –
EUR 400 billion last year or 2.6% of GDP – which is invested in the rest of
the world, especially in the United States; or it lacks productive
investment – which is basically just another way of saying the same
thing. But at the same time, the cost of equity   remains higher on our
continent than in the United States, and half of our large firms’ capital is
held by non-residents, a significant portion of whom are American.
I’m not describing this landscape to depress you, but rather to shed light
on the goals of the Savings and Investments Union. We’ve often talked
about reducing fragmentation. Yes, but firstly to achieve a quantitative
goal: mobilising European savings for European investment. Even more
importantly, it’s about achieving a qualitative goal: supporting innovation
in key sectors (digital and artificial intelligence, energy, defence). On a
broad level, in “macro” terms, we have plenty of financial resources to
bolster the European economy in the face of America’s radical policy
shift.

2. Dispelling three doubts

The idea of a Savings and Investments Union was first put forward back
in 2014, and the amount of time that has since passed occasionally gives
rise to scepticism.
2.1. “Why would this time be any different?”
The project has had a new name since last year and is part of
Commissioner María Luís Albuquerque’s portfolio. This is much more than
just a change of brand: today, the SIU adds together, or unites, the old
Capital Markets Union and Banking Union projects. We have finally
stopped making that slightly theological distinction between banks and
markets. Most of all, the new brand explains “what for” rather than just
talking about the means: we’ve gone from a plethora of technical
measures – over 30(!) – in the Commission’s 2015 and 2020 plans, to a
strategic ambition endorsed by political leaders. 
2.2 “You’re just paving the way for the US
champions”
A second doubt – which is less openly admitted – is that by reducing
fragmentation and regulatory barriers, the SIU simply leaves the door
wide open for US champions. There’s clearly an advantage to keeping
European markets open – notably to lower the cost of equity – but we
have the means to develop European champions – because yes, we do
have some, in banking, insurance and asset management. We need to
pay closer attention to them on a political and strategic level – including
to those in corporate and investment banking (CIB) which is a field too
often neglected. And, of course, we need more cross-border
consolidation to achieve critical mass.
2.3 “It’s not a lack of funding but a lack of
projects”.

The third doubt is the suggestion that the real obstacle may not be a
lack of financing but a lack of projects and economic opportunities in
Europe. Let’s be honest, both could be true. But the answer here is “top-
down”: the Letta and Draghi reports combine a deepening of the single
market and a Savings and Investments Union, economic sovereignty and
financial sovereignty. Rather than asking ourselves where to start, it is
high time we put a complete package on the table. And that we mobilise
around a deadline for putting all this into place.   Jacques Delors
succeeded when he set 1 January 1993 for the single market and 1
January 1999 for the single currency. In Strasbourg yesterday,   the
Commission President mentioned a 2028 roadmap for the first time. We
now need to really emphasise this, and go even faster.
3. Five levers for turning an idea into
actions
I shall now take the risk of prioritising five concrete levers for action.
Only five, compared with the 21 in the excellent roadmap published in
March by the Commission. But a “Top 5” to focus our energy on the
central objective of increasing equity and venture capital. So I will not
talk this evening about securitisation or innovative market technologies
or simplification – without deregulation – or about euro-denominated
safe assets, which are four desirable components, but which do not
bring in capital. The order here is of no particular importance, and none
of the levers can claim to be a “silver bullet”, the surefire solution. But
each can and must be launched, unconditionally.

1) A genuine European supervisory framework for investment funds,
based on the American SEC model, as proposed by Christine Lagarde,
because it is vital to accelerate the scale-up from national to “pan-
European” funds that are therefore genuinely cross-border. Between
2014 and 2025, venture capital funds raised the equivalent of 0.39% of
GDP in the United States, while in Europe they raised less than a fifth of
that, or 0.07% of EU GDP. What’s more, the European venture capital
fund that raised the most money from 2019 to 2023 – which is actually
Swedish, so from outside the euro area – is smaller than the tenth largest
venture capital fund in the United States.
2) The creation of an optional “28th regime” could lower administrative
costs for firms, especially the “cost of failure”. As highlighted by Olivier
Coste in particular, Europe’s higher restructuring costs compared to the
United States can discourage risk taking on the continent. The
consultation  on the 28th regime launched by the Commission in July
2025 is therefore a promising step forward, although questions still need
to be answered: will the regime be just for start-ups or for all firms? Will
it apply only to new inflows or to existing structures as well? Will it
initially include only insolvency and company law, or will it also include
labour and tax laws? Ideally it should combine ambition with speed. But
if we have to choose, it will be better to go fast than to aim too broadly.
3) The Commission is stressing the need to gradually develop European
retirement savings and pension funds, which could generate
significant social and economic gains; they could provide long-term and
patient savings. In Europe, the funds in the Netherlands and the Nordic
countries are by far the most developed, and these countries manage to
combine both strong social cohesion and better innovation.
4) The development of ambitious public-private partnerships in
venture capital is another way of increasing the size of funds. There are
some national initiatives – BPI France and TIBI in France, WIN  .in
Germany. But here again we need to scale up to a European level: the
EIB/EIF’s European Tech Championship Initiative (ETCI) has enabled joint
investments of EUR 2 billion in venture capital funds; let’s aim for at least
EUR 10 billion.

5) This leaves the retail sector and the launch of savings products that
are accessible to households. I hear two objections to this: investing in
equity capital should be left to the professionals, to institutional
investors. Yes, but we should not underestimate the potential of the
retail sector for increasing the political ownership of the “Union” or the
financial literacy of European citizens. Second, it will ultimately be a
question of taxation, and there will be a need for European
harmonisation or at the very least substantial tax breaks. The former is a
somewhat utopian vision, while the latter, in my view, are not essential at
this stage. There is genuine scope for simplification and standardisation.
The “Finance Europe” label launched in June by France, in conjunction
with Spain and Germany in particular, is a first positive step. The
Swedish model, based on the widely distributed ISK  investment savings
account, is one example that has proved its worth: at the end of 2023,
51% of Swedish households’ financial savings was invested in listed
shares, compared with just 21% in the euro area.
I shall conclude with another of the treasures found in this new issue of
the REF,  the rediscovery of the Dickens classic, A Christmas Carol. In
a single night, the old money-lender Ebenezer Scrooge radically changes
his attitude to savings and discovers the joys of sharing them... or, in our
case, of using them wisely. It’s a similar awakening that I would like to
see in Europe, centred around a genuine SIU. We will probably need
more than one night, but it is high time we set ourselves a mobilising
deadline and transformed a good idea into a few concrete actions: a
little, done well and seen through to the end. Thank you for your
attention.
