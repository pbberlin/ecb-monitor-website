 
Climate change and the ECB: we need both enthusiasm and realism  
 
Speech by Governor Pierre Wunsch | CFO Award Trends-Tendances 
 
21 October 2021 
 
 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
It is a pleasure for me to have been invited here and to share my views on 
this very important topic.… As you know, climate change is one of the 
toughest challenges for the planet and the global economic system. All 
economic actors, including central banks, need to think about the role they 
can play to tackle it. This is exactly what the ECB has done recently, in the 
context of its strategy review. Our plan in that context – including some 
reflections that I have about it – will be an important part of my speech. 
Before jumping to my main messages, I should mention that I will only be 
talking about how climate change can affect the conduct of monetary 
policy. I will leave its implications for the other important job of central 
banks, namely financial supervision, for another occasion.  
So, let me start by summarising the five main takeaways of my speech: 
1) Climate change is real and we need to act. That can be done at a 
reasonable cost. 
2) The correct price for emissions is the key (but not only) instrument to 
steer our collective efforts. 
3) Central banks have a rather limited role to play in this, given their 
mandate but also the instruments at their disposal. 
4) However, the consequences of climate change for monetary policy and 
the central bank balance sheet need to be factored in… and the action 
plan that the ECB announced in July will just do that.  
5) Funding the transition to net zero will benefit from advances in 
disclosures and taxonomy but making sure sustainable ac tivities are 
profitable is the key priority.

1. Climate change is real and we need to act. That can be done at a 
reasonable cost. 
Let’s start with my first message. Climate change is real. This has been 
made clear in many studies by renowned scientists and institutions. From 
these studies, it appears that the ecological, social and economic cost of 
no action is ultimately very high. While most forecasts predict that the 
consequences of climate change will be quite mild in Western Europe in 
the coming decade, the July floods have shown the devastating impact of 
extreme weather events. So, t he risks related to climate change in our 
regions might need some re-assessment. 
But in any case, our focus should now be o n mitigation measures. We 
have agreed to net  zero in 2050. Let’s do it! And let’s do it while keeping 
the economic and social costs as low as possible. 
Even during the COVID-19 crisis, when large parts of the world economy 
came to a halt, carbon emissions only fell slightly. Positive news on the 
recovery implies that emissions will again start to grow if we do not take 
any additional measures. Clearly, we are currently not meeting our 
commitments. Emissions should come down by more than 5  % per year. 
We are not there yet! 
I am a strong believer in the capacity of markets to adapt to the new reality. 
But they need clear and stable rules of the game. I therefore welcome the 
new Commission package that aims to extend and deepen our climate 
toolbox, in particular the ETS system. Clear and ambitious long -term 
targets are essential, but they have to be translated into actual instruments 
to cre ate the sense of urgency that is now required. Price signals and 
regulations are needed for climate considerations to be incorporated into 
the decision -making process of all economic actors. It should not be a 
matter of belief… or a matter of being (or not ) sensitive to peer 
pressure…These rules should be binding so that we all act accordingly. 
But let’s be honest. The path towards a carbon -neutral world will not 
necessarily be a happy transition. Taking the right measures to achieve 
this goal will have an economic cost. It will generate opportunities for some 
but be a burden for others. It will for sure disrupt current business practices 
and society at large.  
The precise cost for the economy is heavily debated and estimates differ 
substantially. The overall cost may well not be too high. According to the 
European Commission for example, the impact on aggregate GDP in 2030 

 3/14 
could be n egative or positive, depending on the hypotheses and 
assumptions that are used.  
To put this cost in perspective, let me mention a few numbers. Belgium 
emits some 110 million tonnes of CO2 each year. What about the average 
cost of abat ement? It is not easy to pin down. Some green technologies 
are already competitive. Others are still exp ensive. Costs are also 
expected to fall as technology advances. In the industrial sector, carbon 
capture provides us with some upper bound for the costs. Estimates of the 
cost vary between 100 and 200€ per tonne. I guess 150 euro per tonne is 
therefore a number we can use here as an “upper bound” for the average 
cost of abatement in the entire economy. This would imply a cost of some 
16-17 billion euro per year  to reach net zero in Belgium . As a share of 
today’s GDP, that is some 3.5  %. But we have until 2050  to achieve net 
zero. Therefore, starting today, the yearly cost will gradually increase and 
reach the 16-17 billion figure in 2050. But by then, with a larger economy, 
it will probably be closer to 2 than 3 % of GDP. These numbers are smaller 
than the drop in GDP during the 2008 -2009 great financial crisis and  will 
come about much more gradually. Another way of putting it is that, each 
year, aggregate income growth would be some 0.1 of a percentage point 
lower between now and 2050. 
I know I am taking a risk in mentioning a number. But then, we will only 
know in thirty years’ time. So, nobody can prove me wrong. Also, and most 
importantly, I strongly believe that we need a realistic message on the 
economic impact of climate change. It will not be “party time with free 
money” BUT neither will it be all “doom and gloom”. Our best estimate is 
that the impact will not be any higher than that of previous economic 
shocks – like the oil shocks or financial crisis – but then spread over a 
much longer period. I might be wrong, but this is my best understanding 
of the issue from the many readings I have done on the topic.  
Anyway, even if the numbers suggest that the overall economic impact 
might not be too bad, some important remarks have to be made.  
First, they only consider the long -term impact on GDP and therefore 
overlook the intermediate period. The climate transition requires us to  
gradually factor in the cost to others from carbon emissions. This is a 
negative supply shock. It will constr ain the means of production available 
to us. Also, part of the capital stock will be made economically obsolete  
earlier than foreseen or technically feasible . This is in addition to the 
negative impact on LT potential growth. There is therefore a trade -off 
between speed of action and the negative impact on the existing capital 
stock.

Secondly, large investment  will be needed to reduce emissions. Such 
additional investment can mean lower consumption. And green 
investment might even lead to other necessary investment being crowded 
out. This is probably less of a risk in the short run, given current low interest 
rates, but it cannot be ruled out, especially in the longer run if interest rates 
start rising  again. Another way to look at this risk of crowding-out is 
perhaps easier to imagine: if virtually all research and innovation efforts in 
companies all over the economy are redirected to reduce emissions, other 
welfare-generating projects and activities could be put on hold or simply 
be abandon ed. Productivity – the key source of welfare creation in an 
ageing society – would suffer. 
Last but not least, the costs might be very unevenly distributed across the 
population and economic sectors. Poorer households risk being hit harder, 
as energy represents a larger part of their expenses and they have less 
means to spend on clean investment . Some firms’ activities are very 
energy-intensive: that makes those firms very vulnerable to emission -
reducing measures. Social coherence and competitiveness should 
therefore be kept in mind when charting a path towards net zero. Society-
wide – yet targeted – support is needed to make the ecological transition 
a success. 
  

 5/14 
2. The correct price for emissions is the key (but not the only) 
instrument to steer our collective efforts. 
For a successful transition, a green action plan needs to make economic 
sense. In that respect, economists agree that government action will be 
most effective if carbon is priced so that firms and households take the 
environment into account when consuming  and investing. A carbon price 
and a clear announcement of its future path together form  the most 
efficient way of doing that. All individual decisions can be taken with full 
forward-looking information and that naturally leads to the most cost -
effective options to reduce emissions.  
In practice, the European Union has chosen to use the Emission Trading 
System (ETS) which fixes a maximum emission quantity. Emission rights 
are granted and traded, implicitly leading to a carbon price. In comparison 
to a carbon tax, an ETS has the advantage of directly fixing the target 
variable, that is carbon emissions. With quantities  fixed, the price is the 
buffer and hence becomes more volatile. The current ETS has shown 
some success despite its disadvantages, like its rather limited scope. 
Fortunately, the European Commission has announced an exte nsion of 
the system, which will remove or limit some of its weaknesses.  
By the way, even if higher ETS prices play a role in the recent very strong 
increase in energy prices, it is only one of many factors. The energy price 
boom is driven by several other market -specific factors affecting the price 
of energy products. It is therefore not the result of climate policies.  
But even after the planned extension, relying only on the ETS is risky. If 
people don’t sufficiently internalise higher future CO2 prices, the y could 
postpone necessary actions and the transition would be unnecessarily 
hard in the long term. Therefore, gov ernments will also have to rely on 
regulation, impose minimum standards and  forbid polluting activities. In 
addition, some techniques for reducing the amount of greenhouse gasses 
in the atmosphere are currently very expensive and will surely need public 
subsidies to be kick -started and ultimately be marketed. This is, for 
instance, the case for direct air capture (DAC) 1, which will be needed to 
reach and accelerate to net zero, compensating for residual emissions.   
It is also crucial to regularly review subsidy schemes in order to keep 
providing the right incentives and avoid windfall effects. This is complex, 
as it requires permanent monitoring of lots of elements, not only for the  
related technology but also for other technological alternatives. It is one of 
 
1  DAC, which takes carbon from the air, should not be confused with carbon capture incorporated in 
industrial processes where the carbon concentration is much higher.

the lessons of the past that some technologies have been supported 
excessively. That has resulted in high costs for only small reductions of 
emissions. Policy-makers should support promising but still exp ensive 
technologies on a smaller scale. Innovative projects can then be an 
inspiration for everybody and kick-start private investment. 
Let me summari se this second part of my talk. A carbon price covering 
most economic activities is central to cope with climate change. It gives a 
clear market signal to all economic agents, who can then make the most 
cost-efficient choices. One could say that it gets int o all the cracks of the 
economy. But only setting a carbon price might not be enough to reach 
the desired net zero target. Governments should correct the most adverse 
redistribution effects and could flank this price mechanism with regulation, 
for instance  when network effects play a role. Temporary and targeted 
support of a limited number of promising flagship projects to get these off 
the ground and serve as a role model should also be part of the toolkit.

3. Central banks have a rather limited role to play in this, given their 
mandate but also the instruments at their disposal  
Everything I have said up to now, I consider to be the core of our collective 
efforts to reach net zero. I haven’t mentioned central banks and not even 
financial markets or financial institutions. So, let’s turn to them now. 
What role should the ECB2 play in the fight against climate change? 
The mandates of central banks differ widely all over the world. There are 
of course some common features, like the focus on the pursuit of monetary 
and financial stability or the fact that central banks should enjoy wide 
independence in the performance of their tasks. But the legal mandates 
also differ in the precise way they describe objectives, tasks and 
instruments. We should keep that in mind when comparing the actions of 
different central banks. 
In the EU, the mandate of the central bank is anchored in the Treaty 3. In 
European Law, an EU institution can only have the competences which 
EU Treaties  attribute to it . In other words, for each initiative, for each 
action, the central bank must find a legal basis in the EU Treaties. And I 
guess we all agree that Treaty change is only a theoretical possibility 
today… 
Different views have been expressed as to the legal possibility for the ECB 
to take standalone actions on climate change issues, outside the pursuit 
of its primary objective of maintaining price stability. 
People arguing that such a legal basis exists often refer to the so -called 
secondary objective of the EC B4. The Treaty does in fact state that “The 
primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability ”. But it 
goes even further: “Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the 
central bank shall support the general economic policies in the Union with 
a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union as 
laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty”. 
If you read Article 3 of the Treaty, you will notice that it covers a very broad 
list of objectiv es without any priorities assigned to them. Sure, Article 3 
refers to “a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the 
 
2  For convenience, I refer to the ECB as the monetary policy authority for the euro area. To put things 
more specifically, the legal provisions apply to the ESCB, comprised of the Frankfurt-based ECB and 
the national central banks of the EU. 
3  More precisely, it has been anchored in Article 127 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European 
Union (TFEU) and in the Statutes of the ESCB and the ECB which are annexed to that Treaty.

environment” but only as one among many other objectives: balanced 
economic growth, a highly competitive social market e conomy, full 
employment, social progress, scientific and technologic advance, social 
exclusion and discrimination, equality of women and men, etc. 
I am an economist, not a lawyer. I shall therefore not venture further into 
these legal debates. But it is interesting that this legal possibility for the 
ECB to pursue a stand alone action in the domain of climate change has 
only been discovered recently, while these provisions have been there for 
more than twenty years. 
In fact, I hear more and more voices – including from former central 
bankers – speaking about a risk of mission creep. For instance, the former 
Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, expressed clear warnings 
when he wrote recently that central banks are risking their independence 
by entering into issues traditionally considered as being the domain of 
elected politicians5. Once politicians a nd activists see that central banks 
bend to pressure, he argues, they will push all the harder. In the end, that 
means central banks will find it harder to do what they are uniquely 
qualified to do: to provide monetary and financial stability.  
Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers put it in even stronger 
words. He accuses central banks of trying “to curry domestic political favor 
by focusing on issues like climate change” 6. And, if you allow me a last 
reference, former Bank of England Deputy Governor Paul Tucker warned 
in his book  “Unelected Power” that central banks should show “self -
restraint” in straying into areas where they do not have a mandate 7.  
To offer yet another perspective on the question: how should we think 
about the effectiveness of euro area monetary policy to support climate 
objectives? Monetary policy is about supporting or slowing down 
aggregate demand in the euro area, depending on the outlook for inflation. 
That’s in contrast with what is needed to tackle climate change , which is 
mainly about reinventing the global supply side of the economy. An overly 
proactive role on our side could perhaps even be a disincentive, maybe 
giving governments an excuse for postponing  necessary, but sometimes 
difficult, decisions or reforms? 
Beyond the legal or political arguments, lies another one: monetary policy 
does  not have efficient tools to deal with allocative efficiency. This is the

reason why no economic textbook assigns us a role in this area. We have 
relatively blunt macro tools that are very far from a first -best Pigouvian 
price. 
It is with these caveats in mind that I look at the decisions of the Governing 
Council of the ECB to present an action plan to include climate change 
considerations in our monetary policy strategy. There was unanimous 
support for this, so I also agreed with it. But I also want to underscore that 
this is work in progress. Translating the action plan into concrete decisions 
will have to be discussed and prepared in depth by experts from the ECB 
and the national central banks. Some strands of work are uncontroversial, 
others will have to be challenged , for instance  in view of the concerns 
raised by Mervyn King and Paul Tucker. Also, practical feasibility is a point 
of attention, I’ll come back to that.

4. The ECB’s climate change action plan 
Do not misunderstand me.  I am not saying that  my colleagues from the 
ECB Governing Council and  I should disregard climate change when we 
conduct monetary policy. 
All I have said so far is that an orderly  transition towards a net zero EU  
can only be effective if elected leaders send a clear signal on a fair price 
for carbon. And I have clarified that, in my view,  the scope for facilitating 
this transition with proactive intent  is far less obvious  for unelected 
monetary policy -makers. Moreover , when factoring in political economy 
dynamics, it risks jeopardising our independence. Apart from such legal or 
institutional reasons, we should also acknowledge that our instruments are 
far from ideal for pro-active climate policies. 
That said, both physical and transition shocks do have implications for the 
conduct of monetary policy when pursuing the price stability mandate.  
They are likely to affect aggregate  demand and supply. They therefore 
create new sources of risks for  the growth and inflation outlook. They will 
also affect the functioning of financial markets and the financial sector, 
with possible impairments to  the monetary transmission mechanism. 
Finally, they could imply higher financial risks on the central bank balance 
sheet. 
It was thus more than justified to pay a lot of attention to  climate in our 
recent monetary policy strategy review. There is no question in my mind 
that we need to invest much more in our understanding of the issue, which 
explains (if need be) my support for the action plan announced by the ECB 
in early July. 
The action plan reflects the  breadth and complexity of the challenge.  It 
covers four main areas. 
First, we have committed ourselves to intensifying our efforts to better 
understand how climate change risks impact the macroeconomy and the 
financial system. The ECB and national central banks will coordinate 
investment in analytical tools and  the development of  new data  and 
experimental indicators. 
Second, we will promote knowledge and transparency around climate 
change risks by leveraging the central role that the Eurosystem has on 
financial markets. This aspect focuses on exploring options to introduce 
climate-related disclosure requirements for  private assets that we buy in 

 11/14 
our corporate bond purchase programme or that we hold as collateral 
against our loans to commercial banks. 
Third, we will undertake  climate stress tests o n the Eurosystem balance 
sheet and improve our own balance sheet risk assessment capabilities. 
And, finally,  we will  consider ad hoc  adjustments to our operational 
framework, specifically  to our collateral policy and our corporate sector 
purchase programme. For corporate bond purchases, this means we have 
to define to what extent we can change the  set of principles  guiding the 
allocation of our  corporate bond  purchases to factor in  climate change 
criteria. Besides, we also  intend to continue enhancing our internal due 
diligence process, especially as the availability and the quality of climate-
related metrics  improve.  Going forward,  climate change considerations 
could be given a more important role in our assessments of CSPP issuers. 
As I argued earlier, I fully endorse  the essence of this ambitious action 
plan. In particular, I warmly welcome  the push to better  grasp the 
implications of climate change for  a price-stability-oriented central bank  
and for its balance sheet. To that end, richer statistical data for climate risk 
analysis and efforts on  disclosures and reporting are obviously very 
important. These efforts should keep  the burden for companies  at a 
manageable level, though. 
What about the changes to our operational framework?  Here, I would like 
to plead for  a risk-based approach  that capitalises on methodological 
robustness and solid evidence. Let me elaborate. 
I must first insist on risk-based motivation. The case for adjustments to our 
monetary policy instruments to protect our balance sheet from financial 
risks is conceptually clear, and when these risks are related to climate 
change, too. It is a matter of preserving our ability to fulfill our price stability 
mandate.  
Whether it is relevant in practice, and therefore useful to implement 
specific measures, is a more open que stion. In fact, there are two 
necessary conditions for this endeavour to yield material results. 
The first is solid evidence that financial markets are not adequately 
factoring in risks related to climate change when pricing financial assets. 
In other words, we need to demonstrate that there is a wedge between 
market prices and fundamental values. Fun damental value should be 
understood here as the value that incorporates all currently available 
information, including currently known and expected or announced climate 

12/14 INTERN 
policies. Another aspect to keep in mind is that the relevant horizon for any 
mispriced risk that we may identify should be consistent with the 
exposures on our balance sheet; for instance, very long -term risks are 
irrelevant for our collateral framework because the se are re -valued on a 
daily basis. 
The second condition is that our initiatives need to materially improve our 
risk assessment. For that, we must be able to rely on a sufficient degree 
of disclosure, reliable climate change risk assessments by rating agencies 
and, in the absence of this, an in -house framework which is both 
conceptually clear and can be quantified reliably. 
To me, this seems quite a challenge. 
Coming back to the first condition, research-based evidence on the pricing 
of physical and transition risks is growing, but still limited. Yet, the burden 
of proof – that markets misprice these risks – lies with us. When I read the 
various reports and researc h at our disposal , I cannot escape the 
conclusion that it remains extremely difficult to measure the size of any 
mispricing. The deeply uncertain, non -linear, endogenous and forward -
looking nature of the risks explains that. Howe ver, to be able to act here, 
the bias should be measurable. 
Against this background, I remain very cautious about the calls for shifting 
from the operational concept of market neutrality towards a notion of 
market efficiency. 
Market neutrality is deeply ro oted within the Eurosystem purchasing 
philosophy. It is understood as an ambition to minimise the impact of our 
purchases on relative prices and market liquidity while having an impact 
on the overall level of yields. In practice, it has translated into pur chasing 
bond categories reflecting their market capitalisation. 
Market efficiency, in contrast, is a concept which is deeply rooted in the 
economic literature. To put it very briefly, its application to our purchasing 
framework would enable the allocation of our purchases to be tilted in the 
face of apparent market imperfections, like a carbon price that is too low.  
Taking on board market efficiency considerations is often put forward as a 
means of reducing the carbon bias of credit markets. However, it also very 
much relates to the idea of adjusting monetary policy with a view to 
supporting climate policies. I ex pressed – and backed up – my 
reservations on this earlier.. Aiming for allocative efficiency is not a central 
bank task and could have far reaching implications in many areas.

5. Funding the transition to net zero: disclosures and taxonomy 
versus the right price for emissions 
The implementation of the ECB climate change action plan will be aligned 
with EU policies and initiatives in the field of environmental sustainability 
disclosure and reporting, like the Taxonomy Regulation. Once there is 
agreement on its content, the taxonomy enables activities to be identified 
as environmentally sustainable – or not! – and thus aligned with the Paris 
objectives, the EU Climate Law and the Green Deal. Let me close my talk 
with a few thoughts on how such initiatives can be squared with policies 
that focus on the price mechanism, like a carbon tax or emissions trading. 
Putting a price on carbon, in the EU mainly via the ETS, is all about 
economic efficiency. Firms face an extra cost when producing and they 
will use technologies optimally while maximising profits . The philosoph y 
behind the taxonomy is that investors will use it to discriminate between 
green and less green firms, leading to different external funding costs. 
They, in turn, should impact firms’ choices in the field of climate and 
sustainability. 
I do see a role for  labelling in consumer markets: people can easily pick 
the products and services that are labelled “sustainable” and that should 
be welcomed. On financial markets, informing investors and introducing 
elements of “best in class” or “name and shame” can also  contribute   to 
higher transparency. But we should not expect wonders here. What is first 
and foremost needed for firms to make the “right” choices  is that such 
choices are profitable.  
Here, I have some sympathy for what Tariq Fancy8, former Blackrock head 
of sustainable investing, argues: if a “good” bank discriminates against a 
firm based on an ESG score, there will be a “bad” bank happily buying the 
cheap bonds or shares as long as the firm is profitable. Of course, that 
“good” bank can also be a central bank that uses tilting… This is not mere 
theory. There was recently an article in the FT9 showing how hedge funds 
were making a killing by buying cheap dirty assets from more socially 
“exposed” companies. 
More broadly speaking, I still find it difficult to articulate the interaction 
between CO2 pricing and the taxonomy. The idea behind the ETS – a form 
of Pigouvian price – is that reducing emissions should take place 
efficiently. Some firms have higher costs of abatement than others. Some 
sectors, like renewable energy and electric cars, have lower “green

premia” compared to brown technologies than others. It is therefore 
efficient for firms to have different levels of emission reductions, different 
paths to carbon neutrality.  
So, what is the value added of the taxonomy for two firms that comply with 
the ETS rules? In theory  – in a world with perfect informatio n –, none. 
Unless one might argue that the ETS price is too low… That it is not in line 
with the objective of carbon neutrality in 2050. But this would point to a 
policy failure. The ECB would then act instead of politicians. But this would 
be abusing our independence. 
So, in short, I would a priori be reluctant to rely on the taxonomy to 
discriminate between two firms that comply with the ETS scheme. It would 
not be efficient and err on the side of autonomous policy-making. 
Now, some firms or consumers may want to go beyond what is legally 
required, which is more than fine with me. The taxonomy can also be used 
to fight “greenwashing” and should better inform us about the challenges 
ahead. But, again, from a policy perspective, I find it difficult to articulate 
its role for firms that fall under the ETS regime (which is probably the case 
for most big emitters on our balance sheet). 
Let me conclude by repeating my main messages. 
 
1) Climate change is real and we need to act. I have also taken the risk 
of claiming that this can be done at a reasonable cost. 
2) The correct price for emissions is the key instrument (but not the only 
instrument) to steer our collective efforts. 
3) Central banks have a rather limited role to play in this, given their 
mandate and the instruments they have. 
4) However, the consequences of climate change for monetary policy and 
the central bank balance sheet need to be factored in. The action plan 
that the ECB announced in July should do just that. 
5) Funding the transition to net zero will benefit from advances in 
disclosures and good taxonomy but making sure sustainable activities 
are profitable is key. 
Thank you for your attention.
