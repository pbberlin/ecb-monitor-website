Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, colleagues and friends,
It is a privilege to address you today. Gathered here are innovators, policymakers, 
entrepreneurs, and visionaries who are shaping the future of finance in Europe. We are 
here to share ideas, one another, and to reflect on how Latvia, and Europe  to inspire 
as a whole, can seize the opportunities in fintech space and encourage our citizens and 
economies develop it and benefit from it.
Europe's fintech opportunity
In 2025, the size of European fintech market slightly exceeds 70bn euros (according to 
MordorIntelligence). By 2030, it is projected to almost double, growing at an annual 1
rate of 15%. By comparison, traditional banking grows at around 6% per annum 
(according to McKinsey).2
In late 2022, fintechs accounted for 5% (or between 128-175bn euros) of global banking 
sector net revenues. This share is expected to double to over 342bn euros by 2028. 3
This tells us three things: first, fintech has already secured an important role in the 
financial system; second, it is still small compared to traditional finance; and third, it has 
enormous potential to expand and add value to its customers, all of us.
Fintech may today be a small stream beside the wide river of traditional banking. But it 
is a stream gaining strength, carving new paths, and carrying with it the force to 
reshape the financial landscape.
Growth areas and new value
Where will the next wave of fintech growth come from?
In Lavia we have built a unique foundation for . We are ready to  payments and crypto
see new forms of payments and new tokenized assets to flow into the financial system. 
Alongside them, peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding are expanding access to 
finance for households and small businesses.
Additional innovation drivers are:
AI - transforming finance at a fast pace, it makes risk models smarter and 
provides customers with tailored advice, safer accounts, faster decisions, and 
services that feel personal.
Embedded Finance - creates fantastic opportunity to expand services woven 
into digital platforms. For the financial sector, this means new distribution 
channels and deeper integration with the real economy.

Digital assets and tokenization - offer new ways to invest, transfer, and store 
and create value for customers, they mean greater liquidity, lower costs, and more 
efficient capital markets.
These innovations and your novel ideas will make Europe's economy stronger, our 
financial sector more competitive, and services more accessible and affordable for 
customers.
Latvia's Contribution
Now let me turn to Latvia. Our ambition is clear: we want Latvia to be a European 
fintech hub. This ambition is backed by focused and concrete actions by Latvijas Banka:
Last year we opened the possibility for fintechs to connect directly to our payment 
system. 7 companies have already used this opportunity, and more than 10 are in 
the pipeline.
At the beginning of this year, we introduced a pre-licensing process for crypto 
companies. Today, more than 15 firms are currently under review.
We have designed changes in the regulation to allow fintechs to obtain the so-
called small bank license and the necessary changes in the law are now moving 
through parliament
Latvia's regulator is now highly recognized across Europe for its accessibility and 
strong risk management by many international market participants.
We are not just observers of the fintech revolution. We are building the launchpad, so 
that innovation can take off from Riga and expand to whole of Europe.
Call to Action
So, what comes next? Latvia offers a set of clear advantages for fintechs: an accessible 
regulator, direct access to the central bank's payment system, a crypto pre-licensing 
process, an innovation hub with a dedicated supervisory team, and a competitive tax 
system (0% tax rate on reinvested profits), startup law (allows to receive state aid, 
investment benefits, grants and up to 45% for the remuneration of highly qualified 
workers).
Now, you – entrepreneurs, innovators, the fintech community, must take the leap, 
leading the charge in innovation and boldly shaping the future of finance across Europe.
First, to compete on speed, improved  embrace AI and digital services 
customers' experience, and efficiency.
Second, seize the opportunities within the MiCA regulation and the upcoming 
Open Finance framework, creating innovative services that customers will love to 
use.
Third, the is on its way. Fintech can use it as a backbone to design  Digital Euro 
services and solutions that would make Europe more sovereign, resilient, efficient, 
and competitive.
Fourth, with banks, academic institutions, IT  build long-term partnerships 
service providers, and international players.

3/3 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
And finally, we all must . Latvia's market is small; therefore, our vision is  think big
global. Every product needs to be designed to scale globally.
In other words, our fintechs must think not like craftsmen, but like architects of Europe's 
financial future.
Colleagues, the future of finance is being written right here, right now, by us. It is not 
whether fintech will transform our economy. The question is: are you ready to lead 
this transformation?
Let us make sure that Latvia is one of its co-authors. Let us work together, regulators, 
innovators, and investors, to seize the opportunity, to build trust, and to deliver 
innovation that benefits our people and our economies.
For that to happen, all public and government institutions need to work together. A 
launchpad alone is not enough,because we also need mission control, navigation 
systems, and safety protocols. History favors those who act with courage. Let us be 
bold and build a powerful launch system from which Latvia's fintech rocket can take off, 
sharing the success, creating wealth, and securing the future of our societies
Thank you!
