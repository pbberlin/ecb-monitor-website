1 Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen, 
I am delighted to be here with you today. What better place than Glasgow to discuss 
the economic impacts of climate change and the green transition! And not just because 
it played host to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.
Glasgow is also where Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, studied and 
taught as a professor. Have you ever wondered what he would have thought of climate 
change? As a famed free-market economist, he might not be the first person you would 
think of. But even Adam Smith acknowledged that the invisible hand can sometimes 
lead to suboptimal outcomes.
Climate change is a prime example of this: market prices do not reflect the negative 
side effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Fortunately, it is now widely acknowledged 
that governments need to intervene and encourage individuals and companies to 
reduce their emissions. 
Switching to a net-zero emissions economy is a major task. It requires changes in 
behaviour, innovation and significant investment to rebuild our capital stock. And this 
transition requires significant financing. 
In my speech, I will explore what financing the transition to a greenhouse gas-neutral 
economy could look like. More specifically, I will focus on two key issues. First, how 
much investment is needed to achieve greenhouse gas neutrality, and how much of this 
investment is "additional"? Second, what could the financing mix to fund this investment 
look like?
I know that answering these questions seems like a tough challenge–a taughy fleece 
tae scoor. But I will do my best to illustrate my points with clear, practical examples. 
Along the way, I will discuss electric cars and heating systems to help us understand 
the issues. 
My remarks will focus on the European Unionborrowing some detailed insights  (EU), 
from Germany. Unfortunately, these data do not cover the United KingdomBut I  (UK). 
will do my best to infer some insights for theUK as well.   
2 How much needs to be invested?

2/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Let me start with the question of how much theEU needs to invest to achieve    
greenhouse gas neutrality. TheEU's Fit for 55 package aims to reduce greenhouse gas  
emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030. These reductions are benchmarked against 
1990 emission levels. This is an intermediate step towards full greenhouse gas 
neutrality, for which theEU still needs to pass legislation.   
From 2021 to 2030, the European Commission estimates thatEU countries need to    
invest over €1.2 trillion annually.This amounts to nearly 8 per cent of theEU's1     GDP.  
The private sector must take on the bulk of these investments. The investment needs 
are significantly more than the actual annual investment of €760 billion in the previous 
decade. 
The European Commission defines the difference between the investment required and 
the actual investment as the "additional" investment need. This additional investment 
need amounts to €480 billion, or around 3 per cent of GDP.
This definition of "additional" investment is very useful from an accounting perspective. 
It gives a clear picture of how much more theEU needs to invest to meet its climate    
goals. However, from a financing perspective, it helps to define additional investment 
differently.
There are two types of investment needed to achieve greenhouse gas neutrality. The 
first type is investment that would not happen without the goal of reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions. A prime example of this type of investment is technology to capture and 
store carbon dioxide. This technology will play a crucial role in sectors that are difficult 
to decarbonise. These investments need economic resources and financing beyond 
what an economy spends just to maintain its capital stock.
The second type is investment where a greenhouse gas-neutral alternative replaces a 
fossil fuel-based technology. To illustrate this point, imagine two households buying a 
new car. The Jones family spend €45,000 on a new combustion engine car. From a 
technical perspective, the Jones family are making a replacement investment. No 
additional financing is needed. Meanwhile, the Smith family decide to switch from a 
combustion engine car to an electric vehicle. Let us say a comparable electric car costs 
€50,000. Of this amount, €45,000 is a replacement investment. Only the remaining 
€5,000 requires additional financing.
Contrast this with how the European Commission defines additional investment: They 
subtract the annual average value of electric cars bought in the past from the value of 
electric vehicles needed to meet theEU's intermediate greenhouse gas reduction  
goals. Past registrations of electric vehicles fell significantly short of what is needed. 
Accordingly, the additional investments, as defined by the European Commission's 
accounting perspective, are presumably much higher than the additional financing 
needs. 
How great could the additional financing needs be? While we do not yet have specific 
figures for thethere are some numbers for Germany. A recent study estimates that  EU,

emissions by 65 per cent compared to 1990.They measure this absolute sum in 2020 2 
prices. Relative to the investment amounts to 11 per cent.  GDP,  
This is fairly close to the 8 per cent investment needs calculated by the European 
Commission for the However, only around 30 per cent of this investment requires  EU.3 
additional financing. In absolute terms, this amounts to about €120 billion. 
Let me pause for a moment to summarise the two key takeaways from my remarks so 
far. First, the transition to greenhouse gas neutrality calls for significant investment. 
However, in many cases, we are replacing fossil-based technologies with greenhouse 
gas-neutral alternatives. Accordingly, the additional financing needs are much smaller 
and seem manageable.
Second, we can minimise the additional financing needs by replacing already largely 
depreciated capital stock. By contrast, replacing relatively new capital stock that has 
barely depreciated would increase the economic and financial costs. Let me illustrate 
this point with a brief anecdote. 
On 1 January 2024, the German government introduced a new law governing heating 
systems. In German, it is known by the beautiful name " ". This Gebäudeenergiegesetz
law mandates that heating systems use around two-thirds renewable energy. In 
anticipation of this new law, many households replaced their old gas heating systems 
with new ones. These heating systems can run for around 25 years, so they depreciate 
over a long period. 
Bad luck if you just installed a new gas heating system and live in the German city of 
. Here, the local gas provider has said it intends to stop its services in 2035. Mannheim
This means that a long-term investment will become unviable when little more than half 
of it has depreciated: A waste of both financial and economic resources.
This anecdote highlights one key point: to avoid wasting money, we need a clear and 
reliable path to greenhouse gas neutrality. With a clear path mapped out, people can 
confidently invest in the transition. 
3 What could the financing mix look like?
Now, let us explore what the potential financing mix could look like. To achieve a 
greenhouse gas-neutral economy, households, firms and the public sector all need to 
invest. They can fund these investments using both internal and external sources.
As the name would suggest, internal financing comes from within. Like the Smith family 
putting aside some of their income to pay for their new car. Or think of a firm that sells 
its products and saves some of the profits. That is internal financing, too. External 
financing, on the other hand, comes from outside sources such as banks or investors. 
Regarding their financing mix, households, non-financial firms and the public sector 
differ considerably. Households tend to save significantly and mainly use bank loans as 
a source of external finance. The public sector, on the other hand, raises most of its 
funds from external sources by issuing debt securities. Only firms have a more 

4/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
diversified financing mix. Equity and bank loans play prominent roles here. Note that 
these observations hold for thetheUK and Germany alike.  EU,     
So, what might the financing mix for the transition to a greenhouse gas-neutral 
economy look like? To estimate these figures, we need two key components: First, the 
respective shares of households, firms and the public sector in total investment. 
According to rough estimates by Bundesbank staff for Germany, households might 
have to cover about one-third of the investment, the public sector around 20 per cent, 
and firms just under half.4
Second, estimates for the future financing structure of the sectors. We assume that 
future financing structures will remain unchanged from today.This implies that past 5 
financing structures are suitable for future climate investment. If this were not the case, 
perhaps due to the need for innovative financing instruments, the financing structure 
may differ. 
What result do we get when we combine the two components? For Germany, we 
estimate that about 20 per cent of the financing mix could come from internal financing, 
primarily household savings. In terms of external financing, bank loans might play the 
largest role. They account for over one-quarter of the estimated financing mix. 
Households in particular obtain almost all their external financing from banks.
The second-largest external financing source could be debt securities, accounting for 
around 20 per cent. The public sector plays a prominent role here, with funding coming

be equity financing, comprising around one-sixth. Firms are the only users of this 
financing source, as households and the public sector do not issue equity. Different 
instruments, like loans from non-bank financial intermediaries, might cover the final 
sixth of the overall investment needs. 
So, what does this mean for theEU and the Can the findings for Germany be      UK?  
generalised? Fortunately, the financing structures of households, firms and 
governments are largely comparable across these regions. Therefore, one of the two 6
components in the calculations is roughly equal.
The second component–the sectoral investment needs–is less certain. I am not aware 
of any studies for theEU or theUK that divide the investment needs across        
households, firms and the public sector.Without a better alternative, the findings for 7 
Germany may provide a reasonable initial estimate for both theEU and the     UK.
4 Concluding remarks
Let me summarise and conclude. I have three main takeaways to share.
First, "additional" investment needs to become greenhouse gas-neutral can also be 
defined from a financing perspective. In many cases, we are replacing fossil fuel-based 
technologies with greenhouse gas-neutral alternatives. And this requires additional 
financing only if greenhouse gas-neutral technologies are more expensive or if the 
capital stock being replaced is not yet fully depreciated. The additional financing needs 

5/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
are significantly smaller than the total investment required. Accordingly, I am confident 
that our financial system can mobilise the necessary financing. 
Second, banks may play a larger role in financing the climate transition than is 
commonly anticipated. The main reason for this conclusion is that a substantial portion 
of climate investments falls on households. They need to make their homes more 
energy-efficient and replace fossil-fuelled heating systems with greenhouse gas-neutral 
alternatives. And households simply do not have many viable alternatives to bank loans.
Accordingly, a robust banking system is essential for achieving greenhouse gas 
neutrality. That is why we at the Bundesbank are committed to completing the 
European banking union. However, we also need to improve access to alternative 
financing sources. Non-financial firms, in particular, would greatly benefit from better 
capital market financing. That is why we at the Bundesbank are dedicated to creating a 
European capital markets union. 
Third, legislators can minimise the additional financing needs by ensuring that the path 
to greenhouse gas neutrality is planned stringently and for the long term. Why? 
Because it provides incentives to avoid investments in fossil fuel technologies that may 
not be fully depreciated before they become non-viable.

3 One reason why Germany's investment needs relative toGDP are higher than the     
EU's is that Germany intends to achieve greenhouse gas neutrality sooner (in 2045 
rather than 2050).

assumptions. The analysis assumes that the public sector's involvement in industry and 
the residential investment sector is minimal or non-existent. This is because the 
analysis looks at financing flows before any government support, such as subsidies.
5 More precisely, the financing structure is derived from the average internal and 
external financing flows over the period 2018 to 2022. This averaging smooths out short-
term fluctuations and centres on the reference year of 2020 used in the Kemmler et al 
(2024) study. Internal financing enters the calculation on a net basis, assuming that the 
depreciation inflows finance the replacement investments.

the share is still high. In the public sector, Germany has a significantly higher share of 
debt security financing, particularly compared to theIn the non-financial firms  EU.   UK,

figures are based on average financial flows from 2018 to 2022.

account for 17 to 20 per cent of total investment. However, it does not clarify how this 
investment will be split between households and firms. For theHM Government  UK, 
(2023), Mobilising Green Investment–2023 Green Finance Strategy, mentions that most 
investment must come from the private sector. However, it likewise does not provide 
any details on how this investment will be split between households and firms.
