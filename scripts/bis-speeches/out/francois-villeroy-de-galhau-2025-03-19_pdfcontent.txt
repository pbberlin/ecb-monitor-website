Venturing into open waters to
unlock Europe’s innovative potential

Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Stéphane,
I am pleased to attend this birthday celebration: Euronext is 25 years old,
only one year younger than the euro. And both are remarkable examples
of European success and pride. Yet, to deliver fully, both need to be
complemented with greater economic and financial integration. I cannot
agree more with what Commissioner Albuquerque just said.
A decade ago, when the Capital Markets Union appeared,
macroeconomic stabilisation was its foremost priority. Today, the
overriding objective for our rebranded Savings and Investments Union
(SIU) is to ensure an efficient capital allocation, to fund our investment
needs. This story has been going on for so long that it often raises
doubts: why would the project take off now? I suggest three reasons for
hope. First, it has gained political ownership since last year, and in
particular since the Letta report. Second, today, Europe may be coming
into its own. D. Trump seemingly aspires to break it, but he may be
achieving the opposite. And there can be no strategic and military
autonomy without economic and financial sovereignty. Finally, we are
beginning to focus on a limited number of strong actions rather than the
long list of small items (36 !) in the 2020 action plan. As I am at
Euronext’s annual conference, I will focus on corporate equity for building
a stronger economy. I will first elaborate on our  “Schumpeterian gap ”
and its twin deficits (I). I will then suggest three milestones to scale up
European equity and innovation financing (II).
1. The twin deficits of our
“Schumpeterian” gap: innovation and
equity
1.1. Don’t forget Draghi
i

Let me first remind the obvious. Europe lags behind on growth,
productivity and innovation. Cumulative GDP growth per capita in the
United States between 1999 and 2023 reached 39%, against 26% in the
euro area. European companies invest, as a share of GDP, only half as
much in research and development (R&D) as their American
counterparts. In the meantime, our investment needs have hardly ever
been greater: if we add “Rearm Europe” to the famous Draghi figures, EU
would have to invest an additional EUR 900 billion yearly to remain
competitive in key sectors, such as the environmental and digital
transitions, defence and innovation. 
Investments needs under Draghi report's assumptions
This effort would account for more than 5% of our GDP. Yet, public
resources are scarce and we cannot ramp up fiscal spending indefinitely.
Only four global Top 50 tech companies are European. . However, during
the last decade in Europe, total tech industry workforce has increased
sevenfold compared to the previous decade and total capital invested
rose tenfold , showcasing a positive dynamic.

So much for a clear-headed diagnosis. Now, what is the therapy? Before
coming to its financial aspects, I want to stress the importance of
economic remedies and structural reforms I see with some concern the
“D” of Defence eclipsing and even crushing the “D” of Draghi in our
public debate today. The Letta and Draghi reports and the Commission's
“competitiveness compass” last February call for three imperatives –
three “Is” – that cost nothing in fiscal terms: (i) ‘Integrate more’ the single
market, particularly in services; (ii) ‘Invest better’, particularly in energy
and technology; and (iii) ‘Innovate faster’, by cutting red tape. If we don't
do this together, quickly and decisively, Europe's strategic autonomy
would once again be lost in the sands of economic decline. 
1.2. Equity, our new frontier  
But there is a financial component to the treatment. I won't deal this
evening with public funding, which is the only option for defence: the
German shift is welcome. The Bundestag vote today is a game changer
for Europe, a historical breakthrough. The French challenge is more
difficult, because we have squandered too much of the ‘peace dividends’
in the past on spending on everyday comforts. Private funding is more
promising: the European challenge is not a lack of it, but its
misallocation. 
The EU has considerable private savings, amounting to 5,5% of GDP
yearly, against 3,4% in the US. . However, the structure of European
households’ financial portfolios reveals a predominance of low-risk
assets. 
iv

Equity is more widespread in American than European portfolios
US households allocate more than 50% of their portfolios to riskier
assets, whereas these account for only a third of the assets of European
households. Moreover, European private savings surplus (around 300
billion in 2023) are channelled across the Atlantic to fund US corporates
or public debt, rather than European companies.
Europe’s economy does not lack credit financing; it lacks equity funding.
We can pride ourselves on having a robust banking sector. Banking
assets weight 300% of GDP in the EU, against only 85% of GDP in the
US. Debt market-based financing is relatively less developed in the euro
area than in the US, and used predominantly by larger companies. But
the real gap lies in equity: equity financing of non-financial corporations
amount to 215% of GDP in the US, compared to 88% in the euro zone.

Equity financing of European non-financial corporations is limited
Equity capital financing allows for longer-term horizons, greater flexibility
and higher risk tolerance, which are necessary in frontier technologies.
This aspect is key, as the bulk of the productivity growth gap between
France and the United States over the period 2000–2019 stems from IT-
intensive sectors. .
We all know that total market capitalisation is about four times lower in
Europe. European venture capital remains underdeveloped in comparison
with the United States in all segments, from early to late stage funding.
VC funds raised from 2013 to 2023 amounted to 0,36% of GDP in the US,
while it represented a mere 0,07% of GDP in the EU, with some
heterogeneity between European countries.

Us venture capital funds raise more than their European counterparts
Furthermore, we remain reliant on foreign VC to fund European
innovation,  for more than 50% of late-stage investments in European
tech. 
2. Three milestones to scale up
European equity and innovation
financing  
Let me now set out three milestones to scale up European equity and
innovation financing. We should be taking the best from America, and
leaving the rest. Let us become more simple, more innovative, more risk-
friendly.
2.1 Harmonisation and simplification over
deregulation to unlock growth
ImageThématique Governor Catégorie Speech


When it comes to regulation, we need less a n d  more: less rules, more
harmonisation. Contrary to a strong wind blowing from across the
Atlantic, I have argued that “simplification is not deregulation”  . We
stick to the objectives of financial stability and climate, but we reduce
complexity. In this regard, the EU Commission’s first proposed Omnibus
directive is welcome as it alleviates the regulatory burden on European
SMEs and intermediate-sized entities, but its balance will have to be
fine-tuned. We could possibly streamline somewhat MIFID, and keep the
Retail Investment Strategy simple.
Additionally, greater harmonisation brings clarity. Euronext’s pioneering
spirit in launching the single prospectus initiative - S1 - is commendable
— a concrete step towards reducing market fragmentation. We welcome
the emergence of "coalitions of the willing" among private actors, who
are moving forward within the existing regulatory framework. But we
should seek ingenious workarounds to accelerate the process, such as a
28th regime  creating an optional, harmonised legal framework in key
areas such as corporate law, labour, and taxation. We should always
seek to reduce the European market fragmentation that limits our
effective market size, hindering firms’ ability to scale up. . And we need
a greater harmonisation of supervision. ESMA’s direct supervision of
crypto-asset services providers  and cross border systemic market
infrastructures such as CCPs and CSDs would be a significant step
towards a unified capital market.
2.2. More innovative: boosting European
venture capital

A well-functioning equity financing ecosystem is a prerequisite for
scaling companies; from venture capital allowing start-ups to develop
breakthrough technologies, to private equity for growth and to listed
markets for further expansion. Strengthening the pipeline from early-
stage funding to market exit – whether through IPOs or strategic
acquisitions – would help retain high-growth firms in Europe. The
underdevelopment of European VC is rooted in the fragmentation of our
financial markets and tax regimes, the risk aversion of institutional
investors and the limited role of pension funds, which amount to only
30% of EU GDP (against 136% in the US).
 
The Tibi initiative launched in France in 2019, has enabled to channel
long-term institutional capital into equity financing of innovative and
growing tech companies. “Tibi-labelled” funds have mobilised a total of
EUR 13 billion for 2020-2026, effectively doubling insurers’ participation
in VC fundraising rounds . This success inspired Germany’s “WIN
initiative”, aiming to raise EUR 12 billion between 2025 and 2030.
Complementing national initiatives, a new version of the European Tech
Championship Initiative (ETCI), open to private investor could be
boosted. We should complement this with much stronger public-private
partnerships, with European public capital supplementing pari-passu
cross-border private funds. To date, this initiative has gathered a funding
of EUR 4,15 billion, a favourable yet insufficient amount to bridge the
scale-up gap in Europe. Encouraging institutional investors to diversify
their asset allocation through regulatory adjustments and incentive
structures could unlock substantial capital, as proposed by the IMF .
2.3. Fostering a culture of well-informed risk-
taking

Eventually, we have to sail closer to the wind. To unlock our untapped
growth and innovation potential, fostering a culture of well-informed risk-
taking is essential.
A competing explanation pointed out by entrepreneur Olivier Coste is
that our innovation deficit stems not only from fragmented markets or
insufficiently deep and liquid capital markets, but from the cost of failure
deriving from overprotection of some stakeholders . Our system could
evolve to a more Danish style “flexisecurity”, and improved insolvency
law possibly through the 28th regime. Corporate restructuring costs may
be up to ten times higher in countries with stronger employment
protection legislation  – in that case for highly qualified workforce –,
such as France or Germany, undermining profitability and
competitiveness. This factor especially affects the tech sector, where
projects have a greater risk of failure. It discourages venture capital and
private equity funds from investing in Europe. 
With a more audacious mindset, investments are also concentrated on
high-risk, high-impact projects        . The US and China have built their
technological and industrial leadership by channelling capital into bold,
transformative ventures, particularly in sectors like AI, biotech, and green
energy. By contrast, Europe often favours too incremental innovation, in
fairly mature sectors, and excessive fragmentation in its public and
private investments , – the so-called “Middle-Technology trap”,
stressed among others by Jean Tirole.
Financial education is another key pillar of the SIU. A better-informed
public is more likely to engage in capital markets – with a reduced home-
bias –, ensuring that European households savings are efficiently
allocated to productive investments rather than sitting in low-yield
deposits.
Let me conclude: Europe has strengths to leverage: stable institutions,
high-quality human capital, advanced infrastructures, as well as
abundant savings. We need to mobilise all available assets towards a
common ambitious and meaningful goal. Let’s not downplay the
obstacles we are facing, nor the international headwinds. But let’s have
more of an American virtue: self-confidence. The stoics teach us that we

are not defined by external events, but by how we choose to respond to
them. Or as Seneca states: “We cannot direct the wind, but we can
adjust the sails”.
