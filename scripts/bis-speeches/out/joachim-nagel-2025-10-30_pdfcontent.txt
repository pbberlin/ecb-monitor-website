1 Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen,
I feel deeply honored to receive this prestigious award, following in the footsteps of 
such distinguished recipients such as , the former President of the  Timothy Geithner
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Secretary of the Treasury, Jean-Claude Trichet
, the former President of the European Central Bank, and François Villeroy de Galhau, 
my French counterpart. At a time when trans-Atlantic relationships involve significant 
challenges, I see the award as upheld by the Foreign  a recognition ofthe shared values 
Policy Association, the Bundesbank, and indeed all central banks.
Because what may at first -foreign policy and central  seem like two distinct worlds
banking-are, in fact, bound by a shared mission: the pursuit of stability and international 
cooperation.
In my speech today, I will reflect on that guide the work of central  three key principles 
banks and, in turn, underpin our mission. I am confident thatForeign Policy  the 
Association shares similar values, adapted to the unique challenges and responsibilities 
of foreign policy.
But before I start, let me quote . Speaking during his  President Franklin D. Roosevelt
1944 radio address at the Foreign Policy Association here in New York, he said: I am 
going to talk without rancor, without snap judgment. And I am going to talk without

2 Independence
The first of the three key principles is central bank independence, which matters for

keeping inflation in check–making sure it's neither too high nor too low. In the 
Eurosystem–which comprises the European Central Bank and 20 national central 
banks–our goal is to keep inflation at 2 percent over the medium term.
I've got to admit that it hasn'tbeen easy in the past few years. But time and  always 
again, we've shown that we . To succeed in this mandate, decisions  get the job done

erode. And credibility is the cornerstone for trust. Without trust, the foundations of 
.stability start to crack
History vividly shows us what can happen when central banks don't act independently: 
loss of public confidence, financial turmoil and runaway inflation are not uncommon. I 
do not want to invoke the well-known German inflation trauma from the post-World War 
periods. Rather, let me recall more recent, less extreme episodes. 
Take, for instance, lasting from 1965 to 1982. In this challenging  the "Great Inflation" 
period with drastic movements in energy prices, the U.S. Federal Reserve faced 
to prioritise employment over inflation control. Inflation soared to political pressure 
double digits, eroding purchasing power and triggering widespread economic 
uncertainty. This turbulent era serves as a of the vital importance of  powerful reminder 
independent monetary policy.
In recent decades, have faced similar episodes: other regions   Turkey, for instance, saw 
inflation soar above 80% in 2022, driven by President Erdoan's insistence on low 
interest rates–which undermined the lira, eroded public trust, and fueled instability. 
Turkey's central bank later reversed course, sharply raising rates in 2023 and 2024. 
This helped lower inflation, though it remains high, at above 30%.
Given these historical lessonsIcannot help but by recent ,    feel deeply concerned

too much detail, so let's focus on : three core ingredients First, accuracy, ensuring data 
reflects reality. Second, transparency, allowing users to understand and trust the 
methods behind the numbers. And third, impartiality and independence. 
Accuracy and transparency provide the foundation for impartiality and independence. 
They do come at a cost. Statistical offices need to push continuously to keep this cost 
low, also by generating a digital dividend. But well-designed reporting requirements are 
more than just red tape. They are a necessary precondition for good data. Impartiality 
ensures that data serves as a neutral guide for decision-making.ensures  Independence 
that the methodologies, processes and decisions of statisticians and statistical agencies 
are not interfered with. Without this, even the most accurate and transparent statistics 
become undermined.

4 Focus on core mandate
Let's turn to the guiding central banks: .  third principle   A clear focus on our mandate
This principle is becoming important as uncertainty and political tensions  even more 
rise. And signs of uncertainty abound:
Escalating U.S.-China tensions and Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine are reshaping
the global order.   Rising demands for government spending are adding pressure to

Yet, we must stand by our principles and speak up for them. As central bankers, we 
need to safeguard the purchasing power of households and protect prosperity. Our 
monetary policy decisions must be geared towards this goal and must not be diluted by 
other politically opportune purposes.
