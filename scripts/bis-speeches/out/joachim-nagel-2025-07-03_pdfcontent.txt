1 Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted and honoured to be able to deliver the
20th Walter Eucken lecture.
“Good economic policy is regulatory policy” – this motto has been the hallmark of
the Walter Eucken Institute ever since it was founded. True to that guiding prin‐
ciple, your institution concerns itself in particular with the question of how our
market-based and competitive order can be maintained and further developed.
Monetary policy does not always play the key role in such matters. Nor was
Walter Eucken a specialist in monetary theory, but someone who was mainly
concerned with the economic system in its entirety. Nonetheless, monetary sta‐
bility was a key factor underpinning his economic policy thinking.
One impressive example of this belief can be found in his “Principles of Economic
Policy”, where he writes: “All endeavours to realise a competitive framework are
in vain unless a certain level of monetary stability can be assured.”

Though many decades have passed in the meantime, that statement still stands
up today. And in my view, the fundamental idea behind that remark has since
become the core principle for major central banks: guaranteeing price stability is
their core mandate.
That said, Eucken’s concept of how price stability should be maintained was very
diﬀerent to ours today. One page later he issues this stern warning: “… experi‐
ence shows that a monetary constitution which gives free rein to those in charge
of monetary policy places greater conﬁdence in them than it is advisably possi‐
ble to do.”
This, Eucken argued, harboured the danger that “[…] a monetary constitution
that was not automatically constructed will be abused for inﬂation.” It is a
remark that articulated his fundamental scepticism about government control.
This led Eucken to favour a “commodity-reserve currency” system.
Eucken’s misgivings were picked up again decades later in the form of the time-
inconsistency problem of Robert Barro and David Gordon.  The time-inconsis‐
tency problem is a situation where policymakers are often tempted to deviate
from their pledge to keep prices stable in the short run in order to stimulate the
economy. Economic agents recognise this temptation, however, and adjust their
inﬂation expectations accordingly.
This ultimately drives up inﬂation without actually stimulating the economy.
Policymakers and economic agents end up being worse oﬀ than they would
have been if the price stability pledge had been credible and adhered to
accordingly.
The time-inconsistency problem was mitigated by monetary policy being
entrusted to an independent central bank with a clear mandate to preserve price
stability. Otmar Issing transformed Eucken’s dictum from the “primacy of mone‐
tary policy” to a “primacy of price stability” – and rightly so, in my view.

In my speech today, I will assess this primacy of price stability from diﬀerent
angles while always looking to incorporate Eucken’s regulatory perspective into
my remarks. To this end, I would like to pick up on three topical monetary policy
issues that the ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council has been con‐
cerned with recently. I will therefore structure my lecture around the following
key questions: 
So I will be beginning with some fairly abstract thoughts and become increas‐
ingly more speciﬁc as my speech progresses.
2 Operational framework for implementing monetary policy
Let me begin with the Eurosystem’s operational framework for implementing
monetary policy. The purpose of the operational framework is to help steer
short-term money market rates closely in line with the Governing Council’s mon‐
etary policy decisions.
Decisions regarding the stance of monetary policy, meanwhile – in particular the
level of the key interest rates – are taken by the Governing Council on the basis of
its monetary policy strategy. And at the heart of this strategy is the primary
objective of maintaining price stability.
2.1 Changes to the operational framework for implementing monetary policy
In March 2024, we, the members of the Governing Council, adopted changes to
the operational framework for implementing monetary policy.  These adjust‐
ments came about against the backdrop of the run-oﬀ of the extensive asset
holdings and thus the gradual decline in excess liquidity. 
First, the Governing Council last year adjusted its operational framework for
implementing monetary policy and, as part of these changes, announced that
structural monetary policy operations would be introduced in the future. How
do these operations ﬁt in from a regulatory viewpoint? I will share some more
details about these structural operations in just a few moments.
•
Second, how is the run-oﬀ of the asset purchase programmes aﬀecting the
stance of monetary policy, and which implications have been given insuﬃcient
attention so far?
•
And third, how should the current monetary policy stance be assessed?•
[5]

Excess liquidity is the name given to the reserves held by commercial banks with
the Eurosystem above and beyond the banking system’s structural liquidity
needs. Structural liquidity needs arise, ﬁrst, from what are known as autono‐
mous factors over which we, as a central bank, have no direct inﬂuence. These
factors include the general public’s demand for banknotes, for example. Second,
structural liquidity needs come about because commercial banks are required to
hold a minimum reserve.
The high level of excess liquidity can be traced back to the monetary policy asset
purchase programmes adopted during the period of low interest rates. As the
asset purchase programmes run oﬀ, this excess liquidity will gradually decline.
To prevent this from causing excessive ﬂuctuation in short-term money market
rates, the Governing Council, as a precautionary measure, staked out a frame‐
work for steering money market interest rates in the future. Last year, we agreed
to narrow the spread between the main reﬁnancing rate and the deposit facility
rate from 50 to 15 basis points. 
This is the key lever for steering money market interest rates going forward.
However, its impact will only become more visible as the balance sheet nor‐
malises, once excess liquidity has declined signiﬁcantly. We will closely monitor
how money market rates are discovered based on this change.
We will continue to conduct our weekly main reﬁnancing operations and the
three-month tenders based on the full allotment procedure. This means that
banks will be able to tap into an extensive source of liquidity – and do so in
return for a broad variety of collateral. This helps make sure that banks across
the euro area are treated equally and enables banks to participate in our opera‐
tions, no matter what business model they run.
In addition, the Governing Council agreed in principle to introduce what are
known as structural operations at a later stage. These are expected to be imple‐
mented in the form of structural longer-term credit operations and a structural
portfolio of securities. 

These operations will make a signiﬁcant contribution to covering the banking
sector’s structural liquidity needs. You will remember how I explained that struc‐
tural liquidity needs come about due to autonomous factors, which can be pre‐
dicted relatively well, as well as the minimum reserve requirements.
2.2 Structural liquidity operations: assessment from a regulatory perspective
By agreeing on structural operations, we laid out some fundamental ground‐
work very early on. But how exactly these structural operations should be
designed and how they will relate to each other once the monetary policy asset
holdings have run oﬀ are matters for another day. There is still time to take
these decisions. 
Because in all probability, it will take a few years yet for the asset holdings to
shrink to such an extent that we see a structural liquidity deﬁcit again. Right
now, though, there is nothing to stop us from formulating regulatory principles –
 inspired by Walter Eucken’s line of thinking – that might provide guidance for the
structural operations.
What matters ﬁrst of all is that these structural operations should be, and should
remain, strictly focused on their intrinsic purpose, which is to cover a substantial
portion of the banking sector’s structural liquidity needs. These operations are
not there to fund individual Member States, banks or enterprises. Nor are they
intended to stimulate lending. And they are most certainly not there to inﬂuence
the stance of monetary policy.
A key factor underpinning economic and monetary policy in the European Union
is the requirement to act in accordance with the principle of an open market
economy with free competition – that is a principle that has shaped the
EU (European Union) ever since the Maastricht Treaty. It is about promoting the
eﬃcient allocation of resources, which is an objective that is closely linked to
economic growth and prosperity. 
This principle echoes the thinking of Walter Eucken, who always stressed the
importance of competition and the avoidance of market distortions. Structural
operations should therefore be designed such that they do not interfere with rel‐
ative market prices and the allocation of resources any more than they have to. 

In a structural portfolio, say, having fewer longer-dated bonds and more bonds
with short maturities could help to reduce interference with the term premium.
Limiting structural reﬁnancing operations to sensible maturities would allow pol‐
icymakers to deliver a timely response to potential declines in liquidity needs.
Using a variable rate tender procedure for the reﬁnancing operations would play
a part in upholding competition among bank funding instruments and avoiding
subsidy elements. Because then, banks’ demand and their alternative funding
costs would be reﬂected in the interest rates they bid.
The speciﬁc design of a structural portfolio raises a variety of granular questions,
like which bond classes should be purchased? How can market price eﬀects and
subsidy elements be minimised? These decisions are particularly challenging in a
monetary union. 
One thing is clear: the target volume of a structural portfolio should be sensibly
proportionate to the volume of purchasable bonds. To avoid market distortions,
only small portions of individual bond issues should be purchased.
One possible question from a regulatory perspective is whether corporate bonds
belong in a structural portfolio in the ﬁrst place. Because the main beneﬁciaries
of this would be large enterprises that can tap capital markets. This, in turn,
could distort the allocation of resources.
And one matter that certainly merits consideration as regards public sector
bonds is that we should not reduce the incentives for sound ﬁscal management
as far as we can avoid it. 
As you can see, then, some issues still need to be clariﬁed in future. We still have
plenty of time to do this because the asset holdings are only running oﬀ slowly
and excess liquidity levels will stay high for the foreseeable future.
Leaving this aside, there are practical reasons for introducing the structural
longer-term credit operations ﬁrst and only turning to the matter of the struc‐
tural portfolio of securities at a later stage. That’s because the extensive legacy
bond holdings from the monetary policy asset purchase programmes will be
taken into account when the structural operations are introduced – the
Governing Council agreed as much last year.

This leads the Bundesbank to expect that structural reﬁnancing operations will
be introduced ﬁrst and that a structural portfolio of securities will only be built
up at a later stage. In addition, the Bundesbank believes that suitably designed
structural reﬁnancing operations will cover the bulk of the banking system’s
structural liquidity needs in future.
3 Quantitative tightening
Let me move away from this perhaps somewhat abstract discussion and more
towards monetary policy in practice. The passive run-oﬀ of our asset purchase
programmes is signiﬁcant not only with regard to our operational framework for
implementing monetary policy.
It also plays a role for monetary policy in practice, as it is tending to tighten the
monetary policy stance. And it is doing so despite the fact that the Eurosystem
has already loosened its monetary policy by lowering interest rates eight times
since June 2024.
But does this not mean that these two measures are contradictory and that the
run-oﬀ of the asset purchase programmes should therefore be stopped? The
answer to this is a clear “no”. Allow me to explain to you in more detail why I can
give such a clear answer.
3.1 Steering monetary policy via key interest rates
The asset purchase programmes were introduced when the Eurosystem was
operating close to the eﬀective zero lower bound on interest rates. As a result, it
was hardly possible to further ease monetary policy to any signiﬁcant extent by
cutting key interest rates. In this context, the asset purchase programmes
proved to be a useful instrument of monetary policy.  This was because they
enabled monetary policy to exert additional inﬂuence on medium to long-term
interest rates, in particular. In turn, this helped to stabilise price developments. 
However, considerable purchase volumes were needed to achieve a notable
impact on inﬂation. For example, an overview study from the Journal of
Monetary Economics shows that, in the euro area, purchases totalling around
€150 billion raised the price level by 11 basis points.
[6]
[7]

While the macroeconomic eﬀects of quantitative easing have already been
studied in great depth, quantitative tightening, especially for the euro area,
remains a largely unexplored ﬁeld. In any case, the impact of quantitative tight‐
ening is likely to be weaker overall than the impact of quantitative easing.
First, ﬁnancial markets were prepared at an early stage for the run-oﬀ of the
asset purchase programmes. As a result, there is no noteworthy announcement
eﬀect. Second, the Eurosystem’s balance sheet will shrink by around €30 billion
per month over the coming years.
For the sake of comparison: at its peak, the Eurosystem purchased bonds worth
around €80 billion per month under the expanded asset purchase programme
(APP (asset purchase programme)). Under the pandemic emergency purchase
programme (PEPP (pandemic emergency purchase programme)), monthly pur‐
chases amounted to more than €100 billion at times.
On the whole, the run-oﬀ of our asset purchase programmes should therefore
have only a marginal impact on the monetary policy stance. And we also take
this eﬀect into account indirectly when setting the level of key interest rates. This
is because medium-term and long-term interest rates feed directly into the
Eurosystem’s inﬂation forecasts, which are a key foundation for our monetary
policy decisions.
To sum up: the Eurosystem is now eﬀectively steering its monetary policy stance
via key interest rates. This means that we can continue to allow the monetary
policy purchase programmes to passively run oﬀ without any cause for concern.
3.2 Taking greater account of the impact on central bank ﬁnances
Thus far, I have focused on the desired monetary policy eﬀects of large-volume
asset purchases for the purposes of quantitative easing. However, we must not
lose sight of their side eﬀects. These include, for example, incentives for lending
to less productive ﬁrms, widening wealth inequality, and rising real estate prices.
[8]
[9]

Another possible eﬀect of large-volume asset purchases in the low interest rate
environment was the rapid rise in inﬂation, when the monetary policy stance
had to be tightened signiﬁcantly. The income interest rates on the purchased
medium-term and long-term securities on the assets side of the Eurosystem’s
balance sheet were largely ﬁxed. By contrast, the expenditure interest rates on
the liabilities side of our balance sheet are variable, as banks’ balances are remu‐
nerated at the deposit facility rate. 
The Eurosystem thus took on a high level of interest rate risk with the asset pur‐
chase programmes. This risk has materialised since we had to raise interest
rates quickly and signiﬁcantly in response to the wave of inﬂation. And this
entails considerable balance sheet losses for the Eurosystem and the
Bundesbank. 
Let me make one thing clear: the primary objective of the Eurosystem is to main‐
tain price stability. On the ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council, we
do everything necessary to achieve this – even if using the speciﬁc instruments
required is likely to lead to a loss. There must be no doubt about this. And the
balance sheet losses that we are incurring at present do not restrict our ability to
maintain price stability.
However, in light of recent experience, we should only use the instrument of
large-volume asset purchases at the lower bound in absolutely exceptional cases
in future. 
4 Monetary policy stance
Finally, let us touch upon day-to-day monetary policy business. Earlier, I
described how quantitative tightening inﬂuences the Eurosystem’s monetary
policy stance. But how should we assess the current monetary policy stance
overall?
A well-known concept for this is the natural rate of interest. It is deﬁned as the
real interest rate that would prevail if the economy were at normal capacity utili‐
sation and growing at its potential rate and if prices were stable.

As the natural rate of interest cannot be observed directly, it needs to be esti‐
mated. Eurosystem calculations using various models put the nominal natural
rate of interest at the end of 2024 at between 1.75 % and 2.25 %.
To put this into perspective: since the key interest rate cut at the monetary policy
meeting at the beginning of June, the deposit facility rate, which is relevant to
the monetary policy stance, has stood at 2 %. This is exactly in the middle of the
range that I just mentioned. It is therefore likely that the Eurosystem’s monetary
policy is currently within neutral territory, even if the estimates are subject to
great uncertainty.
Owing to this high degree of uncertainty, it would be risky to base decisions
solely on the natural rate of interest. As a result, we on the
ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council always look at a wide variety of
real and ﬁnancial indicators along the entire monetary policy transmission chain.
This provides us with the most comprehensive picture of the current monetary
policy stance possible. Overall, we are now in a good position with regard to the
interest rate level in anticipation of further developments in inﬂation. 
For our future monetary policy stance, the greatest uncertainty at present –
 alongside events in the Middle East – is undoubtedly the unpredictable
US (United States) trade policy. It is not only unclear how strong its eﬀects could
be. It is also ultimately uncertain whether US (United States) trade policy will
have an inﬂationary or disinﬂationary impact on the euro area.
This is because the end result depends on a large number of factors. These
include the response to US (United States) tariﬀs by the Federal Reserve, devel‐
opments in the exchange rate between the US (United States) dollar and the
euro, any potential retaliatory tariﬀs in Europe, and the impact on international
supply chains.
The degree of uncertainty is exceptionally high. And this is the reason why the
ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council is now, more than ever, making
its decisions on a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting basis.  So, if you
were expecting me to give a detailed outlook of interest rates, then I am afraid
that I will have to disappoint you. 
[10]
[11]

Critics may argue that our data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach
provides ﬁnancial markets with too little clarity and that we should commit our‐
selves more ﬁrmly to a future path of interest rates. There is no doubt in my
mind that Walter Eucken would be on our side here. 
Eucken was critical of monetary policy aimed at active stabilisation, as it is the
central bank that decides the appropriate level of interest rates, not the markets.
To put it bluntly, central banks suﬀer from Hayek’s “pretence of knowledge” –
 which is to say, the presumption of possessing more knowledge than we actu‐
ally do.
There is no question: setting the optimal level of interest rates to stabilise prices
is an extremely challenging task. However, this task is by no means impossible,
as shown by the average inﬂation of just over 2 % during the 25 years since the
introduction of the euro. 
But we can surely agree that the diﬃculty of this task is dependent on the
degree of uncertainty. In times of high uncertainty, as we are experiencing right
now, central banks should not claim to be able to see far into the future. The
interest outlook should therefore be kept correspondingly short-term at present.
5 Conclusion
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that my remarks have shown that the principles of
Walter Eucken are still relevant to monetary policy today. The structural opera‐
tions planned for the future should therefore also be based on regulatory policy
principles.
The gradual reduction of our current asset holdings is a necessary step towards
monetary policy normalisation. Despite the gradual decline in asset holdings,
the ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council is steering the monetary
policy stance eﬀectively via key interest rates.
These are within an appropriate range at present. Uncertainty remains high,
especially following the US (United States) military strikes in Iran. It would there‐
fore be wise for us on the ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council to
continue focusing on ﬂexibility and data dependence.
[12]

I suspect that Walter Eucken, too, would have called for precisely this restraint
and humility faced with the complexity of economic interrelationships. Thank
you for your attention.
