1 Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen,
Thank you all for your interest in the topic of growth potential.
“Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.” This quote by Karl Marxhangs on display in the foyer of the main building at Humboldt University. And, although the right formula for boostinggrowth in Germany is not necessarily to be found in Marx’s ideas, his quote provides good motivation for my speech today.
Many people have already oﬀered their interpretations of the current economic situation. Growth potential in Germany nowamounts to just 0.4 % per year. That’s one percentage point lower than over the past decade and currently more thanone percentage point lower than in the EU (European Union) excluding Germany.  Many people have made suggestionswith regard to which economic policy measures the incoming Federal Government should take in order to boost growth. 
As President of the Bundesbank and a member of the ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council, European monetarypolicy is my main task. We have now made a great deal of progress on the path towards price stability. It was thereforeappropriate that the ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council lowered the key interest rates by 25 basis points at itsmeeting in March.

However, legislators have also tasked the Bundesbank with advising the Federal Government on matters relating to mone‐tary policy. I am here to fulﬁl this advisory role with regard to the future Federal Government.
To be clear upfront – my speech today will not address defence policy, even if there is an unmistakable need for action.Personally, I believe that exceptional times call for exceptional measures. And I think that we are currently living throughexceptional times in Germany. Europe, too, is drawing closer together in the face of this and other challenges. And that is asit should be. 
Nor will my speech be explicitly about scope for borrowing. In this context, however, I would like to stress that exceptionaltimes justify exceptional ﬁscal measures, too. Last week, the Bundesbank presented detailed proposals on potential ways ofreforming the debt brake in a stability-oriented manner and enabling greater investment.  This week, the Bundestag willdebate motions to amend Germany’s Basic Law (Grundgesetz). These envisage considerable additional scope for borrowingthat extends far beyond that proposed by the Bundesbank. This year, the new Bundestag is set to discuss a fundamentalreform of the debt brake. I think our proposals can make a meaningful contribution to this. 
From a monetary policy perspective, it is crucial to overcome future challenges and, at the same time, maintain sound publicﬁnances – both in Germany and in Europe. And greater scope for borrowing alone will not remedy Germany’s weak growth.Its causes are complex and more deeply rooted than that. They therefore require an entire package of measures – many ofwhich do not focus speciﬁcally on funding at all.
In my speech today, I would like to address what I see as the twelve most important areas in which economic policymakersshould make adjustments to put Germany on a structurally higher path of growth. These twelve areas concern three majorsets of topics – labour, energy, and business dynamism. For each set of topics, I would like to examine four points: for anincreased supply of labour, for the necessary transition towards net zero, and for a more dynamic corporate sector.
2 Increasing the labour supply
Let us turn to the topic of labour. Demographic change means that workers are in ever shorter supply in Germany. The babyboomers of the 1960s are entering retirement and the number of working-age persons is in decline. This diminishes ourgrowth potential. To ensure our prosperity, we need more people to work and more part-time employees to work longerhours. Four starting points would help to increase the supply of labour in Germany.
2.1 Increasing the working hours of part-time employees
First, part-time employees could work more hours per week. This would aﬀect women in particular. Although labour forceparticipation among women in Germany is slightly above the European average, women in Germany work far fewer hoursper week than the German average.
One reason for this is disincentives in the tax and social security contributions system.  Certain regulations often mean thatworking more is not particularly attractive. Some examples are non-contributory inclusion in the statutory health and long-term care insurance schemes or special tax rules for those with low income in particular. 
In addition, people often want to work more hours per week but are unable to do so. Despite all the eﬀorts made by thefederal states, there is a gap between demand for childcare places and the actual number of children in childcare. Accordingto the Federal Ministry of Family Aﬀairs, in 2022, there was a shortfall of 321,000 childcare places for children under the ageof three alone. In addition, there was insuﬃcient childcare for 5 % of kindergarten children aged three and above and 21 %of primary school children.  Better care for both children and other dependents may therefore pave the way for increasingthe hours worked by part-time employees. 
However, childcare and long-term care are actually areas that are already desperately looking for staﬀ. This makes it quiteclear that we need the immigration of foreign workers.
2.2 Encouraging labour market-oriented migration
Second, labour market-oriented migration should therefore be encouraged. After revising the Skilled Immigration Act(Fachkräfteeinwanderungsgesetz) in 2024, Germany now has comparatively liberal immigration law for skilled workers fromthird countries. However, cooperation between authorities is lacking. And some bureaucratic hurdles are extremely diﬃcultfor immigrants to overcome.

Visas need to be issued faster. Recognition of professional qualiﬁcations should be easier and cheaper for applicants. Ideally,qualiﬁed people interested in migrating to Germany, as well as their families, should have access to a single point of contactthat would help guide them through the “regulatory jungle”. To do this, processes that are currently spread across manyauthorities would have to be centralised and digitalised. 
At the same time, it is important that skilled workers can settle in Germany permanently once they have entered the labourmarket here. Since freedom of movement of workers was introduced in 2011, more than 30 % of all immigrants who camefrom other EU (European Union) countries to work in Germany left the country again within two years of entering the labourmarket.  Ensuring better labour market integration and making it more attractive to remain in the labour market – this isthe heart of the matter, too, when it comes to the immigration of skilled workers. And this applies to everyone – no matterhow long they have been living in Germany.
This can be supported, for example, by oﬀering more language courses and granting third-country dependents the right toremain so that they have more planning certainty. Xenophobia cannot be tolerated, purely on the grounds of our sharedhumanity. And it is expensive, too: Germany cannot aﬀord discrimination and exclusion.
2.3 Increasing incentives to work among recipients of the civic allowance
The third point focuses on increasing incentives to work among recipients of the civic allowance. Empirical analyses con‐ducted by the Institute for Employment Research show that the civic allowance reform – and the widespread abolition of thesanctions regime that this entailed – has signiﬁcantly reduced the number of people who make the transition from receivingthe civic allowance to actively participating in the labour market.
If we want to counteract this and integrate more recipients of the civic allowance into the labour market, we should considerreinstating the previous rules relating to grace periods, protected assets, breaches of obligations and failures to report. 
2.4 Strengthening incentives to work amongst older people
The fourth point concerns older people. This group has considerable potential for additional, often highly skilled labour.Germany faces particular challenges in this regard: over the next 15 years, the ratio of retirees to working-age persons inGermany will develop much less favourably than on average across theOECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).
In order to expand the labour force, early retirement should be made less attractive. For example, the current pensiondeductions for early retirement tend to be too low. Full pensions with no deductions after 45 years of contributions are aﬁnancial incentive for early retirement. They are taken up particularly by medium-skilled workers with high levels of profes‐sional experience. However, the criterion of 45 years of contributions is not especially well targeted at protecting persons inparticularly stressful working environments. It would thus make sense to put an end to this special arrangement once again.
In addition, the Bundesbank has long advocated for the retirement age after 2031 to be linked to life expectancy.  Atpresent, the retirement age is rising incrementally, and will be 67 from 2031 onwards. This proposal certainly has not madeus popular in all quarters, and politicians are likely to face similar opposition. But burying our heads in the sand is not asolution.
If we are living longer, and largely in better health than previous generations, it is anything but necessary to spend our extrayears just drawing a pension for longer. It would make sense to stabilise the ratio of working years to retirement years. Aretirement age linked to rising life expectancy in this way would not only mitigate the labour shortage and support economicgrowth. It would also reduce the ﬁnancial pressure on the pension insurance scheme.
3 Transforming the energy sector in a way that supports the climate and the economy
My second set of topics concerns the energy sector. The aim here is to give the German economy the best possible supportin achieving net zero emissions. This is an enormous undertaking, in terms of both the time frame and the ﬁnancing. Undercurrent legislation, Germany is supposed to achieve net zero by 2045, a period of just two decades.  At the same time, thiswill require a huge amount of investment.  What is needed for the energy transition to be achieved as eﬃciently aspossible?

3.1 Applying adequate carbon pricing to all sectors equally
First, all sectors should be subject to a standardised carbon price as far as possible. Carbon pricing ensures that environ‐mentally harmful emissions are factored into the calculations when it comes to providing goods and services. The carbonprice thus has an eﬀect via demand, on the one hand, by making carbon-intensive goods and services more expensive. Andit acts via supply, on the other hand, by creating incentives to make products less carbon-intensive.
At present, however, carbon pricing diﬀers across sectors.  Standardising the carbon price as far as possible would allowfor considerable eﬃciency gains. Standardised carbon prices also make sense at the EU (European Union) level. In thiscontext, it is important that Germany continues to advocate for carbon pricing in the EU (European Union) and, if possible, inother economic areas as well. Only a standardised carbon price can ensure that savings are made where they are most cost-eﬀective. If carbon emissions can be reduced at low cost in one sector, but only at high cost in another, a standardisedcarbon price would mean that the cheapest reductions are made ﬁrst. 
Carbon pricing would also make it more attractive to use green technologies and make production more energy eﬃcient.Targeted support for research and development could help ensure that carbon pricing and economic activity can be wellharmonised and that better use is made of productivity potential in the area of green technology.
3.2 Creating a reliable and coherent framework for the energy transition
Second, it is up to politicians to provide a reliable and coherent framework for the energy transition. Owing to the long plan‐ning horizon and large volume of investment, this is the foundation for a successful energy transition. Politicians mustclearly set out how domestic renewable energy and imported energy will work together in combination in the future.Potential shortages in the energy supply must be taken into account, especially during periods with low wind and sunlight inwinter.
An important component of this combination would be a plan to expand energy infrastructure, which must be backed byappropriate incentives. Our networks, reserve power plants and storage capacities must ensure that there is a reliablesupply of energy. In the case of reserve power plants, keeping reserve capacity should be remunerated appropriately, as oth‐erwise it is likely that too little of this capacity will be built up.
Planning and approval procedures have already been simpliﬁed in recent years. We must review whether this is now suﬃ‐cient or whether further steps are needed. If procedures were faster, for example, it would be easier to make greater use ofthe far more cost-eﬀective overhead power lines instead of underground lines when expanding the network.
At the same time, economic incentives should be created in order to achieve better alignment of supply and demand forelectricity within Germany. Here, one option would be the combination of ﬂexible electricity tariﬀs and innovativeapproaches such as bidirectional charging of electric cars.  Flexible electricity tariﬀs create incentives to reduce demandwhen electricity is in short supply and therefore high in price. If you were to charge your electric car at night instead of in theevening, for example, you would save on your electricity bill. At the same time, the market mechanism signals where itwould make sound business sense to increase capacity. Electric cars could also serve as a storage solution in times of highelectricity production and thus low prices. 
In order to fundamentally support the growing use of electricity in the economy, Germany’s electricity tax could also be uni‐formly lowered to the European minimum rate. 
3.3 Abolishing environmentally harmful subsidies
Third, environmentally harmful subsidies should be abolished. This is because they counteract the economic incentives ofcarbon pricing by encouraging the consumption of fossil fuels, whilst at the same time tying up scarce ﬁnancial resources.
3.1 Strengthening the integration of European energy markets
Fourth, it is important to strengthen the integration of European energy markets. Electricity production proﬁles in Europecomplement each other to some extent: countries bordering the North Sea produce a comparatively large amount of elec‐tricity from wind energy. In southern Europe, solar energy is also an important source of renewable energy. And, if neitherthe wind is blowing nor the sun is shining, stored hydropower from Norway, for example, could mitigate the energy deﬁcit.
Deeper integration of the European electricity grid would help to better balance supply and demand as well as reduce thenumber of reserve power plants needed.

4 Increasing business dynamism
Now I would like to turn to the third set of topics: greater dynamism in the corporate sector. Looking back at longer-termeconomic developments in Germany, we see weak business investment,  declining productivity growth  and dwindlingbusiness dynamism.  Reversing these negative trends would lead the German economy back onto a steeper path ofgrowth. But how can this be achieved?
In Germany, doors should be open wide for anyone who wants to invest, anyone who plans to start a business, and anyonewho aspires to bring an innovative idea to fruition. At present, however, the doors are sticking. They are diﬃcult to priseopen and are often irritatingly squeaky. If we want more dynamism, we need to oil the hinges in certain places.
4.1 Reducing bureaucracy
First, whenever I talk with entrepreneurs, time and again I hear complaints about increasing bureaucracy and regulation.The National Regulatory Control Council recommends that reducing bureaucracy should become the systematic rule ratherthan the occasional exception.  The “regulatory jungle” should therefore be reviewed critically on a regular basis. Thisapplies, in particular, to the large number of requirements related to documentation, reporting and notiﬁcation. It is alsoimportant to review whether the rules are working eﬃciently and whether better instruments might be available.
In order to limit the burden of compliance, EU (European Union) rules should be implemented as sparingly and as unbureau‐cratically as possible. This would include largely forgoing what is known as “gold plating”. Gold plating EU (European Union)rules means applying an additional layer of regulation at the national level.
As part of the drive to cut red tape, it would also be important for authorities to interact more closely with each other andwith the economy as well. The same or similar data is often requested by multiple diﬀerent entities. If these were moreclosely interlinked, data would only have to be reported once. Public services should be oﬀered from a single source wher‐ever possible. 
4.2 Facilitating start-ups and strengthening innovative power
Second, in order to unleash more business dynamism, we need to make it easier to start up new businesses and tostrengthen innovative power. More than half of company founders perceive bureaucratic hurdles and delays as being aproblem.  Potential entrepreneurs should be able to start their businesses at a “central port of call”. Such a “one-stop shop”could handle all the typical aﬀairs connected to founding a business.
We should be rolling out the red carpet precisely for innovative start-ups, rather than placing any unnecessary obstacles intheir way. Start-ups and growth ﬁrms beneﬁt from a large domestic market and a suitable palette of funding opportunities.Both factors make it easier for ﬁrms to scale their innovations and grow to a size that would enable them to survive at theinternational level as well. And deepening the EU (European Union) single market would be of central importance in bothrespects.
What goes for goods also goes for services and with respect to the capital markets: barriers to cross-border economic activ‐ity need to go in order for Europe’s economies of scale to be exploited to the fullest.  For instance, the long sought-aftercapital markets union is overdue, not least to mobilise more venture capital.  The future Federal Government should there‐fore do its utmost to advocate for progress to complete the European single market. I am sure that a well-oiled Franco-German motor will take us a long way in this regard.
In the ﬁeld of research grants, too, merging European forces could pay oﬀ. It is precisely with regard to disruptive high-techinnovation, such as artiﬁcial intelligence (AI (artiﬁcial intelligence)), where there is a need to catch up.  A joint European ini‐tiative could help channel EU (European Union) funding more towards these future topics and attract top internationaltalent.
As a new underlying technology, AI (artiﬁcial intelligence) is a launch pad for innovative applications in almost every sector ofthe economy. Consider humanoid robots, for instance. They resemble the human form. With the help ofAI (artiﬁcial intelligence), they are able to identify their environment. And they can communicate too. As they also learn at thesame time, there is a broad scope of applications, especially for industry. Leading the way with regard to the use ofAI (artiﬁcial intelligence) in the economy will be one of the central tasks facing Europe in the years to come.

But at the national level, too, there are starting points for doing even more to support research and development. Forinstance, in Germany, there is generally a “Chinese wall” between military and civilian research. This is denying us opportuni‐ties, as examples such as the internet or GPS (Global Positioning System) show us that technology originally developed forthe military can lead to signiﬁcant innovation. Here, it could pay oﬀ to enable greater synergies.
Studies show that government spending on defence research stimulates further expenditure on research: eachUS (United States) dollar of government expenditure generates between US (United States)$0.57 and US (United States)$0.72 of additional R&D (research and development) in the private sector.  It has also been shown that such an increase inprivate sector research spending also leads to gains in productivity.
In order to get ﬁrms to invest more in research and development overall, they could be given better tax breaks.
4.3 Granting ﬁrms tax relief
This brings me to my third point for increasing business dynamism: tax relief for businesses. Accelerating write-oﬀs over acertain period would create a targeted incentive to invest. This would have a key advantage for the government: it wouldgenerally only defer tax payments, not eliminate them altogether.
However, such targeted relief ultimately does not change the underlying diagnosis: the tax burden on ﬁrms in Germany ishigh by international standards. With an eﬀective average tax burden of 28.5 % in 2024, Germany was almost ten percentagepoints above the EU (European Union) average.
Reducing the corporation tax rate would probably be the most eﬀective way of encouraging more multinational corpora‐tions to relocate to Germany. At the same time, however, this measure would also result in large shortfalls in tax revenue. Inaddition, it would be less targeted in terms of investment compared to accelerated write-oﬀs or an investment allowance.The pros and cons therefore need to be weighed up carefully. 
In any case, it would make sense to simplify and streamline corporate taxation. In Germany, however, this is politically a tallorder: reasonable proposals have been around for decades yet have not been implemented. A recent report by the“Simpliﬁed business tax” expert commission presents a series of proposals worthy of consideration.  A new politicalattempt could be worth trying. 
In order for tax incentives to have the desired eﬀect and actually stimulate investment, progress is necessary elsewhere: inGermany, extensive and time-consuming planning and approval procedures often lie between good ideas and their imple‐mentation. Final decisions can often be delayed considerably due to court proceedings.
4.4 Simplifying and accelerating administrative processes
We therefore see simplifying and accelerating administration as the fourth point on the topic of business dynamism. For onething, digitalisation, automation and standardisation should simplify administrative processes. For another, rules on themaximum period before a decision must be issued can lead to more planning certainty for applicants. Linking such rules tosimpliﬁed indemnities for missing deadlines would create the relevant incentives.
Accelerated planning and approval procedures would also help the government to modernise its infrastructure more rapidly.Germany’s infrastructure is coming under mounting criticism.  Anyone who has driven on Germany’s roads or taken a traincan, in most cases, conﬁrm this impression.
And the search for high-speed internet is often an obstacle course, too. As a case in point, in anOECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) study, Germany was ranked 36 out of 38 with regard tothe percentage of ﬁbre connections.  Fibre connections, though, are of central importance to ﬁrms’ competitiveness andinnovative capacity. This was stressed by the Commission of Experts for Research and Innovation in its latest report, in whichit recommended a rapid expansion of the ﬁbre optic network, particularly in rural regions.
All in all, we can see that there are more than enough doors that should be able to be opened more easily in order to enablegreater business dynamism.

“Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.” Applied to the situation inGermany today, the Karl Marx quote I cited at the beginning of my speech is strong advice to get things moving regardingeconomic growth.
I have listed a dozen areas where the new Federal Government can make adjustments in order for the German economy toachieve more growth once again. The vast majority of the measures that I have proposed would not be a burden on theFederal budget. 
However, some things would come at a cost. It is therefore indispensable to review priorities – however unpopular that maybe. That is also the case if extensive special funds and exemptions to the debt brake give some people the false impressionthat there are no constraints on funding. More debt – the assistance that this provides is ultimately only for a transitionalperiod. Sustainable funding via the budget will have to follow. That is because more debt also means larger interest burdensand less ﬁscal space in the future. 
The formation of a new government is progressing rapidly, and that is important. At this juncture, I do not want to delve anyfurther into the results of last weekend’s preliminary coalition talks. The fact that there is the intention to address key chal‐lenges in some important areas is welcome. This particularly concerns defence, infrastructure, reducing bureaucracy,improving public services and mobilising employment. 
At the end of the day, the speciﬁc implementation is what will be decisive, and many things naturally also have to be settleddeﬁnitively. Policymakers need to make sure that new scope for borrowing is directed exclusively towards new, additionalinvestment and is not ultimately used to plug holes in the budget by shifting ﬁnancial resources to special funds or by meansof exemptions to the debt brake. And the urgently needed reforms to strengthen potential growth and competitiveness haveto be prioritised over special interests.
Ladies and gentlemen, 
We are facing major challenges – political and economic. Smart, consistent and reliable economic policy can set out theframework – and unleash the sense of change we now need.
Germany has great strengths: stable political institutions, ﬁnancially sound ﬁrms that are adaptable and innovative, and, inparticular, well-educated, smart and hard-working people who want to roll up their sleeves. To help move our country for‐wards again.
Germany’s potential lies not least in its position at the heart of Europe. By now, if not beforehand, it should be clear to everylast person that we in Europe have to draw closer together. This primarily concerns our ability to defend ourselves. But oureconomies have to draw closer together as well.
Taking greater advantage of the potential of the single market is of central importance in strengthening Europe’s competi‐tiveness. The ﬁrst things that need to be done are to complete the European banking union and ﬁnally accomplish the longsought-after capital markets union. It will provide the opportunity to increase the ﬁnancial resources to transform our econ‐omies and to deploy them most eﬀectively.
Europe has always made decisive strides forward whenever Germany and France have worked together towards a commoncause. That is why Franco-German dialogue needs to be revived and fostered. It is true that our countries sometimes havevery disparate views. However, the more threatening the world appears to be, the more important it is to remember whatunites us. And to seek out and ﬁnd compromises.
European integration is a hard nut to crack. It may be diﬃcult. But it is worth it. 
Thank you for your attention.

This means that, regardless of the volume of childcare required, several hundred thousand children had no childcareplace at all. See German Council of Economic Experts (2023/24), ,p. 269. Another complicating factor is that, in some cases, the childcare available does not provide enough hours or isnot suﬃciently reliable. See, for example, Hans-Böckler-Stiftung (2023),   or Bertelsmann Stiftung (2023) 
Moreover, inadequate options for dependent people in need of care are likely to prevent more and more women fromincreasing their working hours – or from working at all.

The German Council of Experts on Climate Change analysed a total of 13 diﬀerent studies and quantiﬁed the necessaryannual volume of investment at between €135 billion and €255 billion (“transformation investment”). This is around 3.2 %to 6 % of GDP (gross domestic product). See Council of Experts on Climate Change (2025), Biennial Expertise 2024. Inmany cases, fossil fuel technologies are being replaced by climate-neutral alternatives. This requires additional fundingonly in cases where climate-neutral technologies are more expensive or the replaced capital stock has not yet been fullywritten oﬀ. The need for additional ﬁnancing is thus signiﬁcantly lower. For more on this, see Nagel (2025), Financing thetransition to greenhouse gas neutrality: how much and with which instruments?, speech delivered at the Adam SmithBusiness School, University of Glasgow, 13 February 2025.

In Germany, carbon pricing is currently organised in two diﬀerent systems. The EU (European Union) Emissions TradingSystem 1 (EU (European Union)ETS1 (Europäisches Emissionshandelssystem 1)) covers the sectors of electricity and heatgeneration, energy-intensive industry and aviation with the European Economic Area. The housing and transportationsectors have been covered by a lower national carbon pricing regime since 2021. The HGV (heavy goods vehicles) toll onfederal motorways, which now depends on emission class, adds a considerable mark-up to the carbon price on theseroutes, however. As of 2027, the housing and transportation sectors are to be moved to a new EU (European Union) emis‐sions trading system (EU (European Union)ETS2 (Emissions Trading System)). Based on current legislation, the carbonprice should be higher under EU (European Union)ETS1 (Europäisches Emissionshandelssystem 1) thanEU (European Union)ETS2 (Emissions Trading System), even after 2027. A standardised, all-encompassing carbon pricewithin the EU (European Union) framework is currently envisaged for the period after 2031 at the earliest.
12.
If the carbon price for housing and transportation is set by politicians, as it is in Germany, this must also be high enoughto achieve emission targets.13.
As of 2025, energy suppliers in Germany are obliged to oﬀer dynamic pricing models. On the demand side, however, thiskind of service requires a smart meter. Swiftly rolling out these meters should therefore be an important building blockon the way to a successful energy transition.

Speciﬁcally, the following measures would be appropriate to integrate European energy markets: First, pan-Europeanauctions for renewable energy and reserve capacity should be conducted. See Heussaﬀ, C. (2024), Decarbonising forcompetitiveness: four ways to reduce European energy prices, Policy brief 32/2024, Bruegel. Second, the acquisition oflong-term transmission rights by network operators should be simpliﬁed. This would be possible, for example, byincreasing the frequency of auctions and introducing a secondary market. See also Zachmann, G. et al. (2024), Unity inpower, power in unity: why the EU (European Union) needs more integrated electricity markets, Policy brief 03/2024,Bruegel.

This is also shown by the Bundesbank’s representative survey of ﬁrms conducted in September 2024. When asked aboutpressing problems over the next six months, around two-thirds of ﬁrms made reference to the high level of regulationand government rules – no other problem was cited more frequently. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2024), 
. According toan ifo (economic research institution) survey, the volume of regulation and bureaucracy in Germany is the most impor‐tant barrier to investment; see von Maltzan, A. and L. Zarges (2024),
