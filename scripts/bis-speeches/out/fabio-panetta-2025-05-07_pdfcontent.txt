Invisible yet essential: the contribution of cross-border payments 
to a better world and a safer financial system

from infrastructure roll-out to a smooth customer journey‘

Milan, 6 May 2025
Payments are the backbone of the financial system. An efficient payment system is 
crucial for ensuring the secure and timely movement of funds between individuals, 
businesses, and institutions – both domestically and internationally. 
The efficiency and reliability of payment systems are often taken for granted, and 
largely go unnoticed – until something goes wrong. In recent years, however, there 
has been growing recognition that payments are not just a technical function but a 
vital pillar of financial inclusion, financial stability, monetary sovereignty and even 
geopolitics. 
Technological progress has greatly improved the efficiency of domestic payment 
infrastructures, reducing transaction costs and speeding up execution. However, 
these gains have scarcely materialized for cross-border payments, which remain slow, 
expensive and opaque. The reason is that technology alone is not enough: harmonized 
rules and procedures are essential on this front, and making progress on these aspects 
is more complex.
The stakes are high. In 2024, the global cross-border payments market was estimated 
at over $190 trillion 1 – nearly twice the size of global GDP – and it is projected to 
surpass $300 trillion within the next 5 to 10 years. 
*  I wish to thank Alberto Di Iorio, Antonio Perrella, Tara Rice and Stefano Siviero for their valuable 
insights and contributions.

The G20 and international organizations have recognized the urgency of enhancing 
payments across borders and have called for action, launching an ambitious Roadmap 
to address this issue.2
Today, I will reflect on the key steps and motivations behind this initiative, discuss the 
remaining challenges, and sketch out possible strategies to overcome them.
Why should we care about cross-border payments?
The G20 Roadmap sets out key objectives to improve all three segments of the cross-
border payments market: wholesale payments (which are essential for the smooth 
functioning of the global financial system), retail payments, and remittances (which have 
a more direct impact on individuals’ daily lives).
The decline of correspondent banking: limited access and rising costs 
Cross-border payments have always predominantly relied on a ‘correspondent banking’ 
model. Relying on a chain of intermediaries to complete a transaction inevitably makes 
payments slower, more expensive and less efficient.3 
To make things worse, the tighter prudential standards and stricter AML/CFT4 regulations 
introduced after the Financial Crisis led to a decline in correspondent banking 
relationships.5 Between 2011 and 2022 the number of active correspondent banks fell 
by 30 per cent globally, with some regions experiencing reductions of nearly 50 per cent 
(Figure 1.a).6 As a result, the network has become increasingly concentrated and less 
competitive (Figure 1.b), which contributes to persistently high costs and, in extreme 
cases, limits firms’ access to international trade.7 
2 The G20 Roadmap aims to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, more transparent and more 
inclusive. Specifically, it seeks to achieve quantitative targets for each of the four objectives just 
mentioned and for three different market segments: wholesale, retail, and remittances. In February 
2023, the work was reprioritized around three main priority themes: i) payment system interoperability 
and extension, ii) legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks, and iii) data exchange and message 
standards. See FSB, G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments. Consolidated progress report 
for 2024, 21 October 2024.
3 In a correspondent banking arrangement, the correspondent bank holds deposits owned by a foreign 
bank (the respondent bank) and provides this respondent bank with payment and other services. See 
CPMI, Correspondent banking, July 2016.

The emergence of alternative solutions 
These inefficiencies have triggered the rise of new technologies – such as distributed ledgers 
– and new products –  such as crypto-assets – in order to provide a better solution to 
people’s payment needs. But it is a promise that needs to be taken with a large pinch of salt. 
Unbacked crypto-assets pose significant risks, including the potential for substantial losses 
for end users (Figure 2.a). More importantly, they do not fulfil payment functions as they 
are highly volatile (Figure 2.b), lack intrinsic value and are often under-regulated or entirely 
unregulated.
If properly designed and regulated, so-called stablecoins could instead perform some 
payment functions. However, the proliferation of stablecoins running on non-interoperable 
blockchains risks fragmenting the payments landscape and undermining overall efficiency. 
In addition, regulatory frameworks vary significantly across jurisdictions, and the lack of 
coordination, particularly between Europe and the United States, makes future outcomes 
difficult to predict. 8
8 See for example, A. Di Iorio, A. Kosse and I. Mattei, ‘Embracing diversity, advancing together - results 
of the 2023 BIS survey on central bank digital currencies and crypto’, BIS Papers, 147, June 2024. In the 
US, two stablecoin bills have been introduced; one in the US House of Representatives (the ‘STABLE 
Act’) and one in the Senate (‘GENIUS Act’). In addition, the US Administration issued an Executive Order 
(EO) ‘Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology’ on 23 January. In particular, 
the EO instructs the new Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets to propose a federal 
regulatory framework governing the issuance and operation of digital assets, including stablecoins, 
within 180 days of the order.

Finally, while stablecoins face the risk of a ‘run’ like banks, they typically lack some critical 
safeguards such as access to central bank facilities, deposit insurance, and resolution 
frameworks.
Prohibition is not the answer though. The only effective response to the emergence of 
riskier alternatives is to provide retail payment solutions that are equally efficient, but 
safer and more reliable.
The social impact
Inefficiencies in cross-border payments impose significant social costs on the most 
vulnerable segments of the population. 
Remittances often represent the main source of income for many low-income households, 
and while they may appear modest in the context of total cross-border payments, they 
are vital for certain economies, where they represent a large share of GDP (Figure 3.a). 
Low-value remittances may incur disproportionately high fees relative to the amount sent 
(Figure 3.b). However, high costs are only part of the problem. Many unbanked individuals 
and people living in less developed economies lack access to payment services altogether, 
forcing them to rely on informal, unsecured channels for cross-border payments.9 
9 Unbanked individuals, particularly women from rural and impoverished areas, are disproportionally 
excluded from the formal economy, due in part to lack of financial education and absence of suitable 
alternatives.

In principle, high remittance costs – which effectively resemble a tax on labour income 
earned abroad – could even discourage workers from relocating and hinder international 
labour mobility.
The Asia-Pacific region is particularly significant in this context, as it is the largest 
recipient of international remittances worldwide. In 2023, it accounted for 38 per cent of 
global remittance inflows, amounting to $328 billion. In 2022, remittances to low- and 
middle-income countries in the region matched the volume of foreign direct investment, 
highlighting their role as a vital financial lifeline for developing economies.10 
Addressing inefficiencies in cross-border payments is an increasingly urgent matter. 
In a world marked by growing interconnectedness, expanding e-commerce, and rising 
international travel and migration, the social costs associated with them are likely to 
increase over time. 
Challenges and the way forward
These are the reasons why the G20 launched its Roadmap and set very ambitious 
quantitative targets for improving cross-border payments. 
Over the last five years, international organizations and standard setting bodies, such as 
the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), which I chair, have worked

doggedly to advance the Roadmap. Most of the planned actions have been completed, 
and a wide range of infrastructure improvements have already been implemented. 
Among other initiatives, let me highlight the work done to improve payment system 
interoperability.11 The CPMI has developed frameworks to help payment system 
operators make informed decisions on extending operating hours, 12 expanding access 
to new participants,13 and establishing sound governance and oversight arrangements.14 
I should also mention the CPMI’s harmonized ISO 20022 message data requirements. 15 
When widely and consistently implemented, this messaging standard can significantly 
accelerate payment processing, enhance automation – including in AML/CFT controls – 
and reduce costs. These are real-world improvements that directly benefit users.16 
Even in ‘good times’, it would take time for these efforts to translate into tangible 
improvements for end-users. The proposed guidance should be properly enforced and 
widely adopted. Moreover, several challenges continue to hinder progress towards the 
Roadmap's objectives. These include misaligned AML/CFT compliance controls and 
privacy rules, inefficient implementation of capital controls, limited transparency for end-
users and insufficient competition in certain market segments.
A further complication is that the times are not so ‘good’. Rising geopolitical tensions 
have turned control over global financial infrastructures into a tool of political leverage.17 
Several economies have moved to strengthen their national strategic autonomy by 
reinforcing domestic payment infrastructures or developing independent messaging 
networks. Financial and payment infrastructures have become central to geopolitical 
dynamics, actively shaping global influence and strategic positioning. 18 As a result, 
payments are becoming even more fragmented.
11 Other initiatives completed under the Roadmap include: (i) recommendations to harmonize rules, laws 
and regulatory requirements for collecting, storing, and managing data (‘data frameworks’) for cross-
border payments (see FSB,  Recommendations to Promote Alignment and Interoperability Across Data 
Frameworks Related to Cross-border Payments: Final report, 12 December 2024); and (ii) recommendations 
to level the playing field between banks and non-banks, addressing inconsistencies in their supervision 
and regulation (see FSB, Recommendations for Regulating and Supervising Bank and Non-bank Payment 
Service Providers Offering Cross-border Payment Services: Final report, 12 December 2024).

and established a panel of global ISO 20022 market practice groups in early 2025 to support the regular 
maintenance of the data requirements.

It is increasingly clear that the Roadmap targets are unlikely to be fully met by 2027. But 
this is not an excuse to scale back our efforts. 
Improving cross-border payments was a key priority of the Italian G7 Presidency in 2024.19 
Our efforts focused on promoting one of the Roadmap’s main objectives: the creation of 
bilateral interlinking arrangements between payment systems.
This is not the only path forward. An alternative approach could be to establish a single 
multilateral arrangement with the broadest possible geographic scope. However, its 
appeal – reducing the number of connections – must be weighed against the significant 
challenges of defining governance structures and a shared regulatory framework as 
required for a multilateral platform. 
A realistic and valuable scenario in the near future would be the coexistence of bilateral 
and multilateral interconnection agreements. A limited number of jurisdictions with strong 
strategic alignment and deep economic integration could form multilateral agreements, 
harnessing network effects and effectively creating regional hubs. These hubs could then 
connect to one another, or to individual jurisdictions, through simpler bilateral agreements.
Conclusions
Let me conclude.
The Asian region stands out as a hub of innovation and experimentation – one that we 
observe with interest and from which we can draw inspiration. The implementation of 
several bilateral links across the region has effectively addressed cross-border payment 
inefficiencies in multiple corridors. At the same time, more ambitious longer-term projects 
are also emerging. This is why I believe today's event will be extremely relevant and fruitful.
‘What is essential is invisible to the eye’ said the fox to the Little Prince in Antoine de Saint-
Exupéry’s timeless tale. The same can be said of payment systems: when they function 
well, they go unnoticed – yet when they fail, they are impossible to ignore. Payments 
don’t just transfer money; they move people, businesses, and entire economies. And in a 
globalized world, when payments stop at borders, progress stops too.
Integrating payment systems is not just a matter of improving efficiency; it is a way to 
improve lives. And for many, especially the most vulnerable, the impact can be profound. 
Integration can also be a source of stability. In fact, it is an insurance against political 
fragmentation: as global financial infrastructures become increasingly interconnected, the 
cost of geopolitical confrontations rises, and their likelihood is consequently reduced.
The challenges ahead are many, but they can be overcome through dialogue and 
cooperation.
