SPEECH
Disinflation in the euro area: an update
Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,
at the University College Dublin Economics Society
Dublin, 15 April 2024
My aim today is to review the recent evolution of inflation in the euro area, together with the implications
for monetary policy. The ECB has held the main policy rate (the deposit facility rate) at 4.0 per cent since
last September. At last week’s Governing Council meeting, we indicated that, if our updated assessment of
the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission
were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it
would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction.“
Chart 1 shows the evolution of headline and core inflation since 20191. Let me focus on the disinflation
patterns since August 2023. Inflation stood at 5.2 per cent last August and has subsequently declined to
2.4 percent in March. Energy inflation has moved from -3.3 per cent last August to -1.8 per cent in March;
food inflation has declined from 9.7 per cent to 2.7 per cent; and core inflation has fallen from 5.3 per cent
to 2.9 per cent. Looking at the individual subcomponents of core inflation, there has been a reduction in
goods inflation from 4.7 per cent to 1.1 per cent, and in services inflation from 5.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent.

Notes: HICP refers to headline inflation and HICPX to HICP excluding food and energy. The latest observations for
HICP and HICPX are for March 2024 (flash).
In terms of the array of underlying inflation measures tracked by the ECB, Chart 2 shows the evolution of
the refined versions of these measures, which adjust for the dynamic impact of energy shocks and supply
bottlenecks. The improvements in these measures since August 2023 suggest that the observed
disinflation has a substantial persistent component. At the same time, there has been much less progress
in relation to domestic inflation compared to broader inflation measures, reflecting the higher sensitivity of
domestic inflation to local cost pressures. As captured in Chart 3, the overall disinflation rate largely
reflects the unwinding of the supply shocks that were the primary source of the inflation surge in 2021-
2022.

Notes: HICP refers to headline inflation, HICPX to HICP excluding food and energy, HICPXX to HICP excluding food,
energy, travel-related items and clothing, and PCCI to Persistent and Common Component of Inflation. The “adjusted”
measures abstract from energy and global supply bottleneck shocks using a large SVAR, as explained in Banbura, M.,
Bobeica, E. and Martinez Hernandez, C. (2023), “What drives core inflation? The role of supply shocks’,
Working Paper Series, No 2875, ECB. The latest observations are for March 2024 (flash) for HICPX, HICP excluding
energy and HICP excluding unprocessed food and energy, and February 2024 for the rest.

caused the euro area post-pandemic inflation?”, Occasional Paper Series, No 343, ECB.
Notes: The figure shows a decomposition of the sources of annual HICP inflation between the first quarter of 2020 and
the fourth quarter of 2023 based on the solution of the full model and the implied impulse response functions. The
continuous line shows actual inflation, and the total net heights of the bars are the model’s forecast of inflation in each
period, given initial conditions up to the fourth quarter of 2019. The contributions of the residuals are computed as the
difference between actual and simulated data. The dark blue portion of each bar shows the contribution of pre-2020
data. The coloured segments of each bar show the general equilibrium, fully dynamic contribution of each exogenous
variable to inflation in that period, as implied by the estimated model. Shocks to the rate of change of the relative price
of energy and food are constructed as deviations in the values of those variables from zero. Shocks to the shortages
variable are constructed as deviations in the values from the sample mean. Shocks to the vacancy-to-unemployment
ratio (labour market variable) are constructed as the actual value minus the value in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The role of monetary policy in the disinflation process has been to ensure that the large and persistent but
temporary inflation shocks did not mutate into an increase in the medium-term inflation trend through the
de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Since 2022, the central tendency distribution of longer-term inflation
expectations has remained largely centred at the two percent target, reflecting the general credibility of the
ECB’s commitment to delivering its inflation target.4 Since last summer, a range of measures show that
near-term inflation expectations have also come down and that the risk of inflation staying above target in
the long term has diminished. Charts 4 to 8 shows the evolution of various indicators of inflation
expectations and inflation risk: Chart 4 shows the right tail in the distribution of long-term inflation
expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters has markedly diminished compared to the peak
inflation phase in late 2022; Chart 5 shows that the inflation risk premium embedded in five-year-on-five-


year inflation swaps has declined by about 40 basis points since last summer; Chart 6 shows that the
option-implied probability of above 2.5 per cent inflation in the five-year-on-five-year interval has dropped,
while the option-implied probability of below 1.5 per cent inflation has picked up; Chart 7 shows that,
according to the Consumer Expectations Survey, households have recognised the improvement in
inflation outcomes and marked down their near-term inflation expectations; finally, Chart 8 shows that,
according to the results from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), firms have
lowered their near-term inflation expectations, while the proportion of firms that fear high inflation in the
medium term has decreased."

The lowering of perceived inflation risk is plausibly connected to the faster-than-expected decline in
inflation in recent months, which has provided reassurance that inflation would not remain too far away
from target for too long. This is captured in Chart 9, which shows the evolution of the projected 2024
inflation rate over the September, December and March projection rounds. Chart 10 also shows the
downward revisions to the 2024 growth rate over these projection rounds.

Despite the overall disinflation trend, services inflation remains high at 4.0 per cent. The decline in
services inflation since last summer has largely been in non-labour-intensive services sectors, reflecting
the indirect impact of lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the fading out of pandemic
reopening effects on these sectors. As shown in Chart 11, there is a relatively tight medium-term relation
between wage inflation and the inflation rate for labour-intensive services sectors (which make up a large
part of the domestic inflation component). Over time, deceleration in wage growth is necessary in order for
services inflation to converge to a rate that is consistent with meeting the two per cent target for overall
inflation.

Latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2023 for compensation per employee, March 2024 (flash) for services
inflation and February 2024 for the rest.
Wage pressures are gradually moderating but remain elevated compared to a steady-state benchmark. As
shown in Chart 12, annual growth in compensation per employee decelerated in the fourth quarter of last
year to 4.6 per cent, from 5.1 per cent in the third quarter. Growth in compensation per hour also slowed,
falling in annual terms to 4.4 per cent in the fourth quarter from 5.0 per cent in the third quarter. The wages
and salaries component of the labour cost indicator decreased to 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter from
5.1 per cent in the third quarter. Annual unit labour cost growth fell to 5.8 per cent, from 6.5 per cent, but
remained high, in part reflecting weak productivity growth. Negotiated wage growth including one-off
payments also declined further, falling to 3.2 per cent in January from 4.8 per cent in December, although
this figure does not yet include the data for France and Italy.

As shown in Chart 13, forward-looking wage trackers also continue to provide signs of easing. As shown in
Charts 14 and 15, the feedback from firms participating in the Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS) and the
SAFE point to lower wage growth this year. The March projections foresee subsequent phases of further
wage deceleration in 2025 and 2026, with the growth rate of compensation per employee declining from
5.3 per cent in 2023 to 4.5 per cent in 2024, 3.6 per cent in 2025 and 3.0 per cent in 2026.

In addition to wage growth deceleration, the convergence of inflation to the target also requires
compression in profits. As reflected in Chart 16, annual growth in unit profits decelerated further in the
fourth quarter, falling to 2.8 per cent from 4.7 per cent in the third quarter. This significant decline was the
main driver of the reduction in the annual growth rate of the GDP deflator, which fell by 0.6 percentage
points to 5.3 per cent. As embedded in the March projections exercise, further compression in profits is
required to support the convergence of inflation to the target, and a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy
stance is necessary to provide the dampened demand conditions to limit the pass-through of rising costs
to consumer prices.

Finally, it should be recognised that the current phase of disinflation is necessarily bumpy. In particular, the
swings in energy prices during 2023 will generate oscillations in base effects in the monthly inflation
readings, while the staggered reversal of various temporary fiscal supports will also operate on the price
level in an uneven manner. Chart 25 plots a range of indicators of near-term inflation dynamics and the
projected quarterly evolution of headline and core inflation according to the March projections. Headline
inflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels in the near term on account of base effects in the
energy component and the reversal of the upward effect of the early timing of Easter on services inflation
in March. While services inflation should decline somewhat in the near term, it is expected to remain
relatively elevated for most of this year.

Notes: The cut-off date is 3 April 2024 for the regression forest and 11 April 2024 for fixings. Consensus Economics
data were collected on 8 April 2024. The quantile regression forest estimates are from Lenza, M., Moutachaker, |. and
Paredes, J. (2023), “Density forecasts of inflation: a quantile regression forest approach’, Working Paper
Series, No 2830, ECB. The HICP fixings are observed market prices. The HICPX fixings are estimated based on the
model in Grgnlund, A.M., Ja@rgensen, K. and Schupp, F. (2024), “Measuring market-based core inflation
expectations”, Working Paper Series, No 2908, ECB. The latest actual observation is for March 2024 (flash).
Even if the near-term inflation outlook is somewhat bumpy, the projected convergence of inflation to the
target in 2025 will be underpinned by: the lowering of labour cost pressures; some additional compression
of unit profits; the dissipation of the adverse effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the
pandemic re-opening; and the further unfolding of the disinflationary impact of the restrictive monetary
policy stance. This disinflationary dynamic is consistent with both inflation stabilising at our target in 2025
and a substantial economic recovery, with rising real incomes and improvements in the terms of trade,
together with the prospect of dis-inflation unlocking future interest rate reductions, boosting domestic
consumption and investment, while the normalisation of foreign demand will facilitate growth in exports.
This review of the disinflation path in recent months and the analysis of the drivers of inflation over the
projection horizon indicate that, based on the three elements of our reaction function we can conclude that
the key ECB interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing
disinflation process. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for


as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying
inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that
inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current
level of monetary policy restriction. In informing this assessment, the June Governing Council meeting will
benefit from updated staff projections and the accumulation of data about the dynamics of wages and
profits in the opening months of this year. In any event, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and
meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are
not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
