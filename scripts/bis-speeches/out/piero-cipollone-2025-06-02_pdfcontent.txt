SPEECH
Harnessing the digital future of payments:
Europe's path to sovereignty and innovation
Speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the
ECB, at the France Payments Forum event “Digital euro and the future
of payments in Europe”
Paris, 15 May 2025
Thank you for inviting me to discuss the future of payments and the digital euro.
Most people associate the adoption of the euro with the launch of euro banknotes and coins. While the
euro was introduced for accounting purposes in 1999, we tend to feel it only became our money three
years later once we started paying in euro cash around Europe. Euro banknotes and coins made the
currency the tangible symbol of a united Europe.
A strong currency also comes in tandem with strong payment systems. We offer payment infrastructures
that form the plumbing of the financial system. Though less visible than banknotes and coins, these
infrastructures are key to our monetary and financial integration.
Retail and wholesale payments are hence an integral part of our tasks at the central bank. We issue cash,
supply reserves – the ultimate liquid asset – to banks and operate payment systems, thereby supporting
our economy by enabling euro area transactions that are secure, risk-free and European. This is what
preserves our economic stability and our monetary sovereignty.
Building on this reliable base, private sector firms can then offer their own solutions, without their
customers having to worry about the money they use. One euro is one euro, because private money can
be converted to cash at all times and because financial transactions can be settled in central bank money
– the only risk-free asset there is.
So today, I want to focus on how we can make our currency future-proof and enhance the integration,
competitiveness and resilience of European payments in the digital era.
As people increasingly prefer to pay digitally and online commerce expands, the role of cash as a
universal payment solution is declining. We thus risk being left without a European solution that allows us
to pay throughout the euro area in all situations. To restore the central role of cash, we need to
complement physical cash with its digital equivalent, a digital euro. Making central bank money available
in digital form might seem like a small and obvious step, but it is in fact an essential one for overcoming
the entrenched and longstanding fragmentation of our payment market. The digital euro will achieve this
directly by modernising the supply of public money and indirectly through its infrastructure and acceptance
network, which private payment service providers can leverage to expand and innovate on a European

scale. Ultimately, a digital euro will enhance the competitiveness of European providers and their ability to
offer all types of digital payments to European consumers.
The situation is different for wholesale financial transactions as we already offer settlement in digital
central bank money and do not face the same dependencies. However, market participants increasingly
expect that tokenisation and distributed ledger technology (DLT) will transform financial transactions by
enabling assets to be issued or represented as digital tokens. We are currently expanding our initiative to
settle DLT-based transactions in central bank money. By making central bank money available, we avoid
the risk of other settlement assets being used, such as US dollar stablecoins, which would reintroduce
credit risk, fragmentation and a dependency on non-European solutions.
We are progressing on the retail and wholesale fronts in parallel. In both cases, Europe needs its own,
sovereign money for the digital era, so that it can harness the benefits of integration, innovation and
independence. In the words of the late French economist Michel Aglietta, money is not just a technical
device, it is an essential institution.[ ]
A digital euro for everyday payments
Let me first discuss the rationale for the digital euro and the benefits it will bring.
Currently, cash is the sole sovereign payment method across the euro area. It offers Europeans a
convenient, secure and universally accepted way to pay and store value, ensuring financial inclusion.
Cash also upholds the resilience of our payment systems and economies, acting as a reliable fallback
during crises such as cyberattacks or power outages. This is why we remain strongly committed to cash.[ ]
However, digital payments have gained popularity, with online shopping accounting for more than a third of
our retail transactions. This means that acceptance of and access to cash are no longer sufficient to cover
a growing share of payment situations. In value terms, cash payments made up only 24% of day-to-day
payments in the euro area last year.[ ]
Lacking a genuine European payment solution that works across the euro area, we are left critically
dependent on foreign payment providers.[ ] Currently, nearly two-thirds of euro area card-based
transactions are processed by non-European companies while 13 euro area countries depend entirely on
international card schemes or mobile solutions for in-store payments.[ ] And even where national card
schemes are available, they require co-badging with international card schemes to facilitate cross-border
payments within the euro area or online shopping. Moreover, mobile apps and e-payment solutions are
dominated by foreign solutions like PayPal, Apple Pay or Alipay. And they partner with international card
schemes to further reinforce their position and expand their reach: PayPal has just announced that it will
start enabling contactless payments in Germany, using Mastercard technology.[ ] Looking ahead, our
dependency could soon extend to foreign stablecoins, 99% of which are dollar-denominated in terms of
total value.[ ]
As a result, European payments face three significant challenges.

First, we need to ensure our strategic autonomy and monetary sovereignty. Our overreliance on foreign
payment providers makes us dependent on the kindness of strangers at a time of heightened geopolitical
tensions. I trust that this risk is well understood in the country of De Gaulle. There is no true sovereignty
without sovereign money.[ ] As my dear colleague Banque de France governor François Villeroy de
Galhau has remarked, this is as true in the 21st century as it was in the past.[ ]
Second, we should simply ask ourselves why there is no Europe-based international card scheme. I would
say it’s because we suffer from a lack of competitiveness and innovation. European payment service
providers focus on their home country and struggle to compete on a European level, let alone on a global
one, limiting their ability to drive large-scale innovation. The cost of investing in a European-wide
acceptance network has often discouraged European payment service providers from offering a European
card payment solution.
These failures come at a high price: the dominance of non-European providers stifles competition, leading
to higher costs for merchants and consumers. And when transactions are conducted through international
card schemes, European banks lose fees. When transactions are made on apps such as Apple Pay or
PayPal, they lose fees and data. And if the use of US dollar stablecoins becomes more widespread, the
banks could lose, fees, data and deposits.
Third, user experience is still poor for Europeans, who juggle multiple payment solutions to meet various
needs. Despite the euro's 25-year legacy, we still lack a digital payment solution that can be used across
all euro area countries.
By introducing the digital euro, we aim to tackle these challenges head-on.
Importantly, the digital euro would make payments more convenient. It would provide a digital payment
method that complements cash, extending its benefits into the digital realm. For instance, it would have
legal tender status, meaning that it would be accepted wherever one can pay digitally. And it would also be
available offline, offering users similar privacy to paying with cash and allowing them to pay even in the
absence of a network connection. A digital euro would give European consumers a simple and safe digital
payment option, free for basic use, that covers all their payment needs everywhere in the euro area.
In fact, one simple reason for introducing the digital euro is that people want it. Even at this early stage,
surveys show that close to half of respondents would be likely to use the digital euro – a number that has
significantly increased over time.[ ] This trend is confirmed by several surveys[ ] conducted by national
central banks which suggest that many Europeans are open to the idea of using a digital euro.
Launching the digital euro would also ensure that the euro area retains control over its financial future. By
offering a secure and universally accepted digital payment option which would be suitable for all use cases
– and, crucially, under European governance – it would reduce our dependence on foreign providers. This
would protect European merchants from excessive charges, strengthening their bargaining power with
those providers and offering an attractive alternative.[ ] At the same time, European banks would be able
to retain their customer relationship and be remunerated for their role in distributing the digital euro. And

the digital euro would limit the likelihood of foreign currency stablecoins becoming widely used for retail
payments within the euro area.
Moreover, the digital euro would be based on a core public-private partnership that would leverage
synergies, enabling private initiatives to scale up across the euro area. For instance, domestic card
payment solutions could co-badge with the digital euro to cover transactions currently beyond their reach.
At the same time, banks’ wallets and internet banking solutions could integrate the digital euro as an
alternative way to pay that is accepted throughout the euro area and supports both contactless and QR-
based payments.[ ] The open digital euro standards – which can be finalised as soon as the regulation on
the digital euro is adopted and can start being used even before the digital euro is issued – would facilitate
cost-effective standardisation, allowing private providers to launch new products and functionalities on a
European scale. This would unlock innovation and create new business opportunities. In fact, research
shows that stock prices of European payment firms increase in response to positive announcements on
the digital euro, whereas those of US payment firms decrease.[ ]
Last October we issued a call for expressions of interest in innovation partnerships for the digital euro.
Some 70 merchants, fintech companies, start-ups, banks and other payment service providers – including
four from France[ ] – have now joined us in exploring the potential of the digital euro to drive innovation.
[ ] Our innovation platform simulates the envisaged digital euro ecosystem, in which the ECB provides
the technical support and infrastructure for European intermediaries to develop digital payment features
and services at European level. One of the areas we are exploring is broadening the set of possible
conditional payments, such as making payments dependent on successful delivery of goods or services.
In July we will release a report on these innovation partnerships. It will include the technical information
shared with the participants, enabling the entire market to replicate these activities, thereby further
supporting innovation by the private sector. Additionally, based on the positive feedback from the pioneers,
we will extend the exercise until the end of June, which will allow us to test new functionalities of
conditional payments, incorporating fresh ideas and suggestions from our private sector counterparts.
The digital euro's success in reclaiming our autonomy in the retail payment space and boosting innovation
capacity hinges on collaboration. In recent years we have engaged extensively with market stakeholders,
gathering input from consumers, merchants, banks and payment service providers. We have also started
working with market participants on the digital euro rulebook – a single set of rules, standards and
procedures for digital euro payments.[ ]
This inclusive approach helps us to address everyone's needs and perspectives, crafting a robust
payment solution and platform that will benefit all Europeans, support private sector innovation and
preserve the future of our money – the euro.

Let me now turn to wholesale transactions, a domain where technology holds tremendous potential for
transformation.
Currently, we facilitate transactions between financial institutions through our TARGET Services: T2
processes over 90% of large payments, while T2S handles securities transactions.
These services have significantly enhanced the efficiency and integration of post-trade platforms in
Europe. And we plan to continue improving them: in 2023 we extended T2 operating times to 22.5 hours
on weekdays and we are about to launch a consultation paper investigating stakeholder needs and their
interest in a further extension of operating hours. In a month’s time we will also launch the European
Collateral Management System, which will provide a single, harmonised framework for handling collateral
in the 20 euro area countries.[ ] And in October 2027 we will move to T+1, shortening the settlement
cycle from two days to one. Meanwhile, emerging technologies such as DLT and tokenisation have the
potential to bring about a step change in wholesale markets.
These technologies are no incremental improvement: they represent a fundamentally new way of
operating by allowing assets to be issued or represented in digital token form. This innovation would
enable market participants to manage trading, settlement and custody on a single platform, available 24/7,
365 days a year. It would also synchronise trading and settlement. And it would enable new business
models, as tokenised money can be used to automate conditional transactions. DLT and tokenisation
could also reduce the cost and barriers to access capital markets, in particular for small and medium-sized
enterprises.
In fact, the emergence of these new technologies is an opportunity to establish an integrated European
capital market for digital assets from the outset – a digital capital markets union – which would contribute
to better channelling our savings into productive uses and boosting Europe's innovation potential.[ ] It
could help European capital markets to become a hub for DLT-based financial services.
European banks are active in this space, with over 60% exploring or using DLT and 22% already
implementing DLT applications. On the securities front, there is a growing number of high-profile issuances
on DLT.
The availability of central bank money for settling transactions using these new technologies is crucial for
two reasons. First, without central bank money, other settlement assets like stablecoins or tokenised
deposits may be used, reintroducing credit risks and fragmentation into the financial system. Second, the
market views the ability to settle in central bank money as a key factor in adopting new technologies.
Last year the Eurosystem conducted exploratory work with DLT for settling wholesale transactions in
central bank money, using three different solutions to ensure interoperability between our infrastructures
and market DLT platforms.[ ] The results were highly promising, with 60 industry participants settling real
transactions in central bank money or conducting experiments with mock transactions. A wide range of
securities and payments use cases were covered, including the first issuance of an EU sovereign bond
using DLT. A total of €1.6 billion was settled over a six-month period, exceeding values settled in
comparable initiatives in other parts of the world.

As the next step, we have already announced plans to provide a solution to settle DLT-based transactions
in central bank money in the short term.[ ] Looking further ahead, the Eurosystem will explore a more
integrated, long-term solution. A critical risk is indeed that DLT application fragmentation and a lack of
interoperability could hinder the development of liquid DLT-based markets in Europe, imposing high costs
on investors and issuers connecting to multiple platforms. So we need to create a more harmonised and
integrated ecosystem.
One way to achieve this would be to move towards a shared ledger: a programmable platform bringing
together token versions of central bank money, commercial bank money and other assets, on which
market players can provide their services. Another option could be the coordinated development of an
ecosystem of fully interoperable technical solutions, which might better serve specific use cases and
enable the coexistence of both legacy and new solutions.
This approach will help us enhance the efficiency of European financial markets through innovation,
aligning with the Eurosystem’s goal of achieving a more harmonised and integrated European financial
system.
However, we cannot do this alone. As we enter this new exploration phase, collaboration with public and
market stakeholders will be crucial.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The journey toward a digital euro and the integration of new technologies in wholesale transactions
represents a pivotal moment for Europe. By embracing these innovations, we can strengthen our
monetary sovereignty, enhance our competitiveness and pave the way for a more integrated and resilient
financial system.
The digital euro will ensure that Europeans have access to a secure, reliable and universally accepted
digital payment solution that complements cash while reducing our reliance on foreign providers.
Meanwhile, leveraging central bank money in DLT-based transactions will foster a dynamic and unified
digital asset market, driving innovation and unlocking new business opportunities across the continent.
In this transformative era, collaboration is key. We must bring together all stakeholders – public and
private, national and European – to craft solutions that reflect the diverse needs and perspectives of all
Europeans. Together, we can harness these technological advancements to build a financial ecosystem
that is not only more efficient and innovative but also more inclusive and secure.
We have inherited a united Europe and a currency embodying this unity. Our legacy should be European
sovereignty and a euro that is fit for the future. This is our collective responsibility, in the public and private
sector alike.
Thank you for your attention.
