Peace and prosperity in a fragmented world
Speech by Fabio Panetta* 
Governor of Banca d’Italia
Economy and Peace: a possible alliance  
Fondazione Centesimus Annus Pro Pontifice 
Bologna, Centro San Domenico, 16 January 2025
Today, our world is facing an alarming rise in geopolitical tensions and conflicts. The 
number of wars, which had decreased after the fall of the Berlin Wall, has turned upward 
again in the last fifteen years; in 2023 it reached its highest level since World War II 
(Figure 1).
In many regions, war – often fratricidal – is a daily reality.1 Day after day, the news brings us 
dramatic images, reawakening fears linked to the traumatic experiences of the two world 
wars. In Western Europe, the debate about significantly increasing defence spending has 
resurfaced after a long time. 
But conflicts are not the only cause for concern. The denial of basic needs, which still 
affects large parts of the world's population, is also a form of violence. 
After decades of ever stronger international cooperation and economic integration, 
history now seems to be taking a step backwards. 
It is a very different world from the days when I started working as a central banker. In 
many ways, it is a world of greater uncertainty and less hope for the future, although 
even back then there was no shortage of stark clashes and dramatic tensions.2 
*  I would like to thank Andrea Brandolini, Patrizio Pagano, Roberto Piazza, Pietro Rizza and Girolamo 
Rossi for their help in writing this speech, and Valentina Memoli and Roberto Pisano for their editorial 
support. 
1 Most of the ongoing armed conflicts are civil wars. Those in Myanmar, Sudan and Ethiopia are among 
the bloodiest (Source: ACLED). The war in Sudan is causing a devastating humanitarian crisis: some 
25 million Sudanese are suffering from food shortages; 10 million have fled their homes and 2 million 
have sought refuge abroad.
2 In the 1980s, despite signs of progress and hope – such as the possible rapprochement between the 
superpowers – there were still geopolitical, social and economic tensions. The Cold War shaped world 
politics, fuelling fears of an imminent nuclear conflict. In the Middle East, the Iran-Iraq war and the 
conflict in Afghanistan, with the Soviet invasion, strained international relations. Apartheid in South 
Africa was a further sign of the persistence of racial segregation dividing societies around the world. 
In Poland, the Solidarity movement and political tensions under the Communist regime exposed the 
internal struggles within Eastern Europe.

2
It was therefore with great pleasure that I accepted the invitation from the Centro San 
Domenico and the Centesimus Annus Foundation to reflect, as an economist and with 
due humility, on such a fundamental issue as the link between peace and prosperity.
I welcome this important opportunity to acknowledge the Centro San Domenico’s 
patronage of Catholic cultural activities for over fifty years. These efforts, like those of the 
Fondazione Centesimus Annus and above all of the Italian Episcopal Conference, are part 
of the Catholic Church’s long-standing commitment to addressing social and economic 
issues, with a particular focus on inequalities and conflicts.3
3 The first encyclical on economic and social matters – the Rerum novarum, promulgated at the end of 
the 19th century – was not the origin but the outcome of Catholic engagement on these issues. As 
far back as the middle of the century, at the height of the industrial revolution, many prominent 
Catholics were actively analysing the risks of industrial capitalism and of colonialism. At that 
time, when class conflicts broke out and the Communist Party Manifesto by Engels and Marx 
was published, important Catholics such as Cardinals De Bonald in Lyon, Manning in Manchester 
and Gibbons in Baltimore spoke out on the distortions  of the capitalist industrial system, while 
people such as Von Ketteler, a German bishop, engaged  with the most important representatives 
of socialism. Catholic economists and sociologists – from the Italian scholar Giuseppe Toniolo 
to the Germanic intellectual Carl von Vogelsang – analysed the problems of capitalism and 
proposed new models of work organization (see O. Köhler, La formazione dei cattolicesimi nella 
società moderna , in Storia della Chiesa,  Vol. IX: La chiesa negli Stati moderni e i movimenti sociali 
1878-1914 , Milan, Jaca Book, 1982, pp. 234-239, and O. de Dinechin, SJ, Rerum novarum, in 
‘Aggiornamenti sociali’, 3, 2019, pp. 258-262).

(1) Intrastate conflict: a conflict between a government and a non-governmental armed group within the territory of a given state, resulting in at least 25 battle-related 
deaths in one calendar year. If a foreign state is involved, the conflict is defined as ‘internationalized’ . If this is not the case, it is defined as ‘non-internationalized’ . –  
(2) Extra-systemic conflict: a conflict between a state and a non-state group outside the state’s own territory, resulting in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one 
calendar year. – (3) Interstate conflict: a conflict between states, resulting in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year.

1. War cannot generate prosperity 
Humanity cannot thrive without peace, and neither can the economy. 
In the countries involved in a conflict, war seriously damages the drivers of growth. 4 
Hostilities destroy productive capital: infrastructure, machinery and raw materials. They 
claim victims, especially among the young generations, bending learning opportunities 
and the formation of a skilled workforce to the requirements of war. This reduces the 
availability and quality of ‘human capital’. Furthermore, wars often erode social capital, 5 
thereby weakening social cohesion and trust in institutions.
The war effort supports aggregate demand and can stimulate innovation, but seriously 
distorts its purposes. The economic benefits are short-lived and do not remove the need 
to reconvert the economy once a conflict is over, even in countries that were involved in 
the conflict but suffered no direct damage to their territory. The high inflation and the 
steep fall of economic activity that often mark wartime periods are signs of the damage 
that wars inflict on the economic fabric (Figure 2).
The manufacturing of war equipment does not help increase a country’s growth potential.6 
Development comes from productive investment, not from arms. That is why, in the 1930s, 
John Maynard Keynes proposed a massive rise in public investment spending as a solution 
to economic depression in the United States, suggesting that President Roosevelt’s focus 
should be on ‘the rehabilitation of the physical condition of the railroads’. 7
Moreover, it is misleading to attribute technological progress to military expenditure. It is 
scientific research that sparks innovation. Military investment can generate innovation if 
it is allocated to research.8 However, we do not need to resort to war for this: technologies 
developed for military purposes only translate into progress when they later find civilian 
applications. 
War is therefore a form of ‘development in reverse’9 and cannot bring prosperity.

5 Research on the importance of social capital for economic development has been influenced by 
Robert Putnam's work on Italy (see R.D. Putnam, Making democracy work: civic traditions in modern 
Italy, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1993).
6 The fact that military spending is not, in and of itself, an instrument of economic development does 
not mean that it does not play a necessary role in national defence.

1933. See also G.B. Eggertsson, ‘Great expectations and the end of the depression’, American Economic 
Review, 98, 4, 2008, pp. 1476-1516. 
8 For example, the Manhattan Project, developed in the US during World War II, led to the exploitation 
of nuclear energy. Similarly, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) programme, 
set up in the 1950s, produced the internet. NASA’s moon landing in the 1960s resulted in aviation 
and satellite technology advancements, such as GPS. But only military spending dedicated to research 
can generate long-term economic benefits (see J. Antolin-Diaz and P. Surico, ‘The long-run effects of 
government spending’, American Economic Review, forthcoming).

2. Growth and integration as instruments of peace
Economic growth, prosperity and peace are instead closely linked.10
To understand this connection, we must recognize that development in modern 
economies is based on integration and international trade. 11 The free movement of 
goods, capital, people and ideas facilitates the transfer of knowledge and technology, 
thereby helping to bring peoples together. 
The idea that open trade and deep integration of production can secure lasting peace 
inspired the global economic framework that emerged after World War II.
The relationship between economic integration and peace is explicitly cited in the Havana 
Charter, which in 1948 sought to create an international organization for world trade to 
promote stability and prosperity. The Charter never did enter into force, but the talks 
led to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was succeeded by the 
World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. 
10 For Kant and Montesquieu, economics was the foundation of peace. In Perpetual peace, Kant argued 
that ‘the commercial spirit cannot co-exist with war’ and that international economic relations must 
be underpinned by international law ‘based upon a federation of free states’ (I. Kant, Perpetual peace, 
London, 1795, pp. 157 and 68). Montesquieu, in turn, wrote: ‘L’effet naturel du commerce est de porter 
à la paix’ (Montesquieu, De l’esprit des lois, 1748, book XX, chapter II, p. 349).
11 The correlation between open trade and growth after World War II has been studied by J. Feyrer, ‘Trade 
and Income-Exploiting Time Series in Geography’, American Economic Journal:  Applied Economics , 
11, 4, 2019, pp. 1-35; see also J.A. Frankel and D.H. Romer, ‘Does Trade Cause Growth?’, American 
Economic Review, 89, 3, 1999, pp. 379-399; D. Rodrik, One Economics, Many Recipes: Globalization, 
Institutions, and Economic Growth, Princeton and Oxford, Princeton University Press, 2007; M.J. Melitz 
and S.J. Redding, ‘Trade and Innovation,’ NBER Working Paper Series, 28945, 2021.

In 1944, the Bretton Woods Conference established a multilateral system to promote 
cooperation and trade on a global scale. Other institutions followed over time, such as 
the World Bank (1944), the International Monetary Fund (1945), the OECD (1961), the 
G20 (1999) and the Financial Stability Board (2009).
The European project itself was conceived as a way of preventing new conflicts between 
neighbouring countries, following the devastations of World Wars I and II. In the words 
of Robert Schuman, the economic unification of Europe aimed to make war ‘not merely 
unthinkable, but materially impossible’.12 
These initiatives fuelled the globalization that has taken off since the middle of the last 
century. The ratio of international trade to GDP rose from 20 per cent in 1950 to 34 
per cent in 1975 (Figure 3) and then increased further in the following decades, mainly 
because of the end of the Cold War and the integration of new countries into the global 
economy, notably China. In 2019, this ratio reached 60 per cent. 
Meanwhile, the global production structure has become increasingly complex and 
interconnected due to the creation of global supply chains and an increase in trade 
agreements, from 50 in 1990 to 300 in 2021.13 
This open, multilateral trade system has fostered development. The freedom to trade 
goods and services, to invest across borders, and to share knowledge and ideas has 
improved economic well-being for much of the world’s population, creating new job 
opportunities – especially for women – and reducing inequalities between advanced and 
developing countries (Figure 4).

Access to international markets has allowed many emerging economies to grow,14 lifting 
hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty. It is estimated that without 
the progress made over the last 35 years, 2.4 billion more people would be living in 
destitution today.15 
As the role of international cooperation grew stronger, conflict between states subsided. 
All this progress led Steven Pinker to consider globalization as one of the reasons for the 
‘long peace’ following the end of World War II.16
3. Globalization, its discontents, and geopolitical shifts
Globalization has brought indisputable benefits, but there have been unwanted effects 
too, which have not always been fully understood or properly addressed by governments 
and international institutions. 
Although openness to foreign trade has improved living conditions in emerging 
economies and reduced income inequalities between countries, it has also often 
exacerbated inequalities within States. 
14 Openness to trade has benefited developing countries both directly and indirectly. Direct benefits 
include access to new production technologies and new markets. Indirect effects include greater 
competition between businesses and, consequently, higher domestic production efficiency. This 
openness has also prompted governments to improve the quality of their fiscal and monetary policies 
(see A. Chari and P.B. Henry, ‘Learning from the doers: developing country lessons for advanced 
economy growth’, American Economic Review, 104, 5, 2014, pp. 260-265). 
15 In 1990, the world population was 5.3 billion, 38 per cent of which lived in extreme poverty (defined 
by the World Bank as living on less than $2.15 per day, at current prices). Had the share of people 
in poverty not decreased, today – with a world population of 8.2 billion – there would be 3.1 billion 
people living in absolute poverty; instead, there are 700 million (see United Nations, World Population 
Prospects: Summary of Results, New York, July 2024).

In advanced economies – in the absence of reforms in areas such as education, health 
and social protection – globalization and the relocation of production have contributed 
to a slowdown in the income dynamics of workers in low-skill and low-paid jobs, but also 
of many in the middle class.
Many low-income countries – in Sub-Saharan Africa especially – have remained trapped 
in extreme poverty and high debt, in spite of the economic progress afforded by their 
involvement in the global economy and in spite of aid from multilateral development 
banks17 and advanced countries. 
Over 700 million people are suffering from food and water shortages globally, and even 
more lack access to adequate healthcare.18 Almost 700 million people have no electricity, 
while 2.3 billion have to rely on using polluting fuels for cooking, posing serious health 
risks.19 Around 250 million children aged between 6 and 18 are excluded from education,20 
with marked gender inequalities.21 
Moreover, the increasing economic clout of emerging economies has not been 
accompanied by corresponding advances in political freedoms. This is partly why leading 
countries have been reluctant to review the governance of international institutions 
in order to grant these new economic powers more representation, which has led to 
dissatisfaction on their part.
These factors have caused many to view globalization as an elitist project, whether rightly 
or wrongly,22 fuelling resentment among large sections of the population. The 2007-08 
financial crisis further undermined trust in the ruling classes, eroding confidence in the global 
17 Multilateral development banks include the World Bank and regional development banks, foremost 
among which are the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the 
African Development Bank. In Europe, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development financed investments in Central and Eastern European countries 
after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

without adequate healthcare is a complex issue: according to the World Bank and the World Health 
Organisation, over half of the world’s population (4.5 billion people) have no access to essential medical 
services; for more details, see the page on the World Bank’s website: Universal Health Coverage.

21 Girls are often unable to attend school because of conflicts and social fragility, and girls are twice as 
likely as boys to be excluded from school in war-torn countries. See UNICEF, 27 million children out of 
school in conflict zones, press release, 18 September 2017.
22 Much of the negative effects on the labour market in advanced economies have in fact been driven 
by technological development and falling transport costs, which have facilitated the offshoring of 
production to emerging countries. However, in the public debate and according to general perception, 
these effects are often attributed to globalization. See F. Panetta, ‘The future of Europe’s economy amid 
geopolitical risks and global fragmentation’, Lectio Magistralis delivered on the occasion of the conferral 
of an honorary degree in Juridical Sciences in Banking and Finance by the University of Roma Tre, 
Rome, 23 April 2024. Moreover, not all countries have complied with WTO rules: for example, industrial 
development in China has benefited from public subsidies that have outpriced companies and workers 
in other countries (see European Commission, EU imposes duties on unfairly subsidised electric vehicles 
from China while discussions on price undertakings continue, press release, 29 October 2024).

governance model based on free trade, economic integration, the role of international 
financial institutions and that of supranational bodies in the resolution of disputes. 
The world is now evolving in the direction of a multipolar and fragmented system, with 
rising nationalist and protectionist sentiments and growing competition among opposing 
blocs of countries. Geopolitical tensions are escalating as a result. 
On the economic front, these strains have led to trade disputes between the United States 
and China, to Brexit and to a growing number of vetoes by governments on foreign 
investments in domestic companies. Global trade is fragmenting and is increasingly 
being used for strategic purposes, especially in the race for technological dominance. In 
the next few years, a rise in protectionism can be expected, driven by US policies.
Meanwhile, military conflicts are spreading dramatically, and have now come to Europe too. 
In this context, a growing tendency to reject shared international principles has emerged, 
even to the point of questioning the efficiency of democratic rules in global competition.23 
This raises very serious concerns for the future of international relations.
4. What economic policies are needed for peace?
The priority must be to preserve a global economy that remains open to international trade. 
Severing economic and trade links would lead to a significant loss of well-being for the 
world’s population, further weakening the multilateral framework that has underpinned 
global economic development since the end of World War II, with repercussions that 
would extend beyond the boundaries of economics and finance. I will not dwell on these 
aspects, as I have discussed them elsewhere.24 
That said, it is necessary to correct the imbalances that have emerged over time in order 
to prevent deprivation and frustration from fuelling tensions and conflicts. 
To achieve these goals, it is essential to act on several fronts, both domestically and 
internationally. I will only mention a few key points here, without claiming to be exhaustive.
The first step is to combat inequalities, in both poor and advanced countries.25 Reducing 
gaps in income and opportunities is not only key to building a fairer and more equal 
society, but is also essential to guarantee social stability. Moreover, it is a prerequisite 
23 In the words of the President of the Italian Republic Sergio Mattarella: ‘Our public opinions are instilled 
with the doubt that democratic power is weak, inefficient, slow, and unfit to govern quick-paced 
evolutions. Or even that it is a penalizing factor in competing with non-democratic systems. ' (speech 
by the President of the Italian Republic Sergio Mattarella at the Ceremony for the exchange of end-of-
year greetings with representatives of institutions, political forces and civil society, Rome, 17 December 
2024).
24 F. Panetta, ‘The future of Europe’s economy amid geopolitical risks and global fragmentation’, 2024, 
op. cit. and F. Panetta ‘Economic developments and monetary policy in the euro area’, speech at the 
30th ASSIOM FOREX Congress, Genoa, 10 February 2024.
25 The Magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church constantly addresses economic inequalities. See, 
among others, Benedict XVI, Encyclical letter Caritas in veritate, 29 June 2009, no. 42; Francis, Encyclical 
letter Fratelli tutti, 3 October 2020, no. 116.

for development: if a significant part of the population is excluded from economic 
opportunities, the entire economy suffers.
Another step is improving education and training systems. Fair access to education 
is necessary to break the poverty cycle and build a skilled and productive workforce 
capable of adapting to market changes and starting new economic activities. Investing 
in the education of young people, regardless of their initial conditions, means leaving no 
one behind and making full use of the human capital available. 
It is also vital to step up social protection and ensure access to efficient health services. This 
would enable workers to weather difficult times without falling into poverty, encouraging 
their active participation in the labour market while promoting social cohesion and 
economic stability. 
Another priority at international level is managing the external debt of the poorest 
countries,26 which has reached $1.1 trillion.27 
Today, as was the case forty years ago, we must think about how to relieve the burden 
of this debt, which is hindering productive investment and holding back development in 
many countries.28 
However, the success of current initiatives is challenged by the involvement of new major 
creditors, such as China, and by current geopolitical tensions.29 Accelerating these efforts 
would be one concrete step towards finding solutions to improve the living conditions 
of the populations affected.
But that is not all. It is essential to adopt policies that support development, countering 
the pressure that extreme poverty exerts on migratory flows, making them difficult 
to control. Investing in the management of these flows is critical to supporting the 
economies of the migrants’ countries of origin and to responding to the consequences 
of demographic decline in the destination countries. Additionally, pursuing sustainable 
26 The issue of debt of poor countries was raised by Pope John Paul II as early as 1986  in his speech 
to the United Nations (see CEI, ‘Etica e finanza’, supplement to no. 19, Quaderni della Segreteria CEI, 
August 2000, pp. 40-42). It was recently revisited by Pope Francis for the 2025 Jubilee (see Francis, Bull 
of Indiction for the Ordinary Jubilee, Spes non confundit, no. 16, 9 May 2024). 
27 The figure refers to the debt held at the end of 2023 by the poorest countries, i.e. those that have access 
to concessional loans from the World Bank. The long-term external public debt of these countries has 
reached $780 billion. According to debt sustainability analyses conducted by the IMF and the World 
Bank, more than half of poor countries are considered as being in ‘debt distress’ or ‘at high risk of debt 
distress’; the share was less than one quarter ten years ago.
28 We must not repeat the experience of the 1980s, the ‘lost decade’ in the development of many 
countries, caused by the delay in recognizing the need to reduce their external debt and by the 
ensuing insolvency crises. 
29 The Common Framework for Debt Treatment, signed by the G20 countries in 2020, is the most 
significant attempt to regulate the debt restructuring processes of low-income countries, expanding 
the participation in the governance of these processes to non-Paris Club countries, such as China. 
The Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, created in 2023 and comprising official bilateral creditors, 
private creditors and debtor countries, is a useful complement to the Common Framework, focusing 
on fostering debate on the most important challenges facing restructuring.

development models is necessary to ease tensions over access to scarce resources, like 
water and energy, which often fuel conflicts.
Conclusions 
Globalization has undoubtedly increased integration between countries and created 
opportunities for economic and social progress in many regions of the world. 
However, it has also exposed very clear limitations. Current trade and geopolitical tensions 
are symptoms of a system that has not fully met the expectations and needs of the 
world’s population. Every day, thousands of people continue to suffer from deprivation 
and violence, often from seemingly endless fratricidal conflicts.
The economy appears to have become globalized without fostering a ‘global 
consciousness’. 
Economic integration and international cooperation need to be revived, and their flaws 
corrected with policies that promote sustainable and inclusive development – policies 
that combine growth with social justice, environmental protection and the eradication of 
poverty.
Peace and prosperity are closely intertwined. 
Peace is not merely the absence of conflict; it is also about creating the conditions for 
every individual to live in dignity, free from fear and poverty. At the same time, any 
prosperity that does not contribute to widespread well-being will prove fleeting, and 
risks generating conflicts and instability.
As Pope Paul VI stated in his encyclical Populorum progressio , ‘development means 
peace’.30 Today, these words remind us of the urgent need to work for a future of fairer 
and more peaceful prosperity.
