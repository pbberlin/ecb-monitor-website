1 Introductory remarks
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to extend a warm welcome to you all here at the Bundesbank's Capital City 
Reception.
It is a great pleasure to have Zanny Minton Beddoes with us this evening as our guest 
speaker. Zanny probably won't be aware of this, but she helped set the agenda for this 
event two years ago. At that particular Capital City Reception, we discussed whether 
Germany was once again the sick man of Europe. That question had been brought up 
by a widely regarded cover story in "The Economist". And incidentally, there's hardly 
any other question I've been asked about so frequently since then.
Today, we want to look at the bigger picture beyond Germany with Zanny Minton 
Beddoes. Given the changes in the global situation, you could almost say our theme for 
this evening suggested itself: Europe's new global role.
2 New geopolitical reality
The period between the 1980s and the onset of the financial crisis saw globalisation 
and multilateralism blossom. Those blooms withered slowly at first, then abruptly. Or, as 
Ernest Hemingway would have put it, "gradually and then suddenly". Nowadays, 
vegetation of a different variety is running rampant in the geopolitical landscape: tariffs, 
a pivot towards nationalism, and a war in Europe. What kind of "harvest" is Europe in 
for now?
Let's be realistic: there isn't a single state on our continent that is a major power on its 
own. At the same time, national rivalries are on the increase worldwide, and order is 
based more on power than on rules. In this kind of world, it's all too easy for individual 
countries to become the plaything of the major powers. More sovereignty is something 
we gain mainly by acting together. If we stand as one in Europe, we have the 
opportunity to determine our future for ourselves.
Though it may still be incomplete, the European Union's single market carries great 
economic weight internationally. That's something theEU can put in the balance in    
negotiations. But what if the other side uses different weights altogether to tilt the scales 
in its favour–like special types of semiconductors or rare earths? Then the situation 
changes: dependencies in critical areas weaken our negotiating position. For Europe to

leverage its own strengths in negotiations, it must start with the weak points and build 
up its muscles right there. Let me briefly show you where and how that might happen 
using two examples. 
3 Strengthening Europe together
3.1 Improving defence capabilities together
Europe needs stronger muscles, first, in terms of its defence capabilities. This is where 
two developments come together: one,EU Member States are facing the gravest threat    
to their security in decades. Two, the United States, the strongest partner in theNATO   
alliance, is calling on us to contribute much, much more to our own security than before. 
Taken together, this means that Europe will have to build up its defence capabilities 
through its own efforts–and do so quickly. Ambition and reality lie far apart.
I'm a central banker, not a defence expert. It does seem clear to me, though, that close 
cooperation and coordination in Europe are crucial to live up to that ambition. And I say 
"Europe" deliberately. Because the door should also be open to countries outside the 
EU if they have similar security interests, like theUK and Norway.     
We should take a joint approach to large-scale defence projects that promise to protect 
the whole of Europe, for example. Various joint initiatives have been undertaken, but 
defence procurement has, for the most part, been a national matter to date. In small-
scale markets in which national defence champions wield significant market power, the 
growing demand can hardly be met efficiently. Rather, there is a risk that prices will 
spike sharply higher if additional orders are placed.
That is why I welcome the European Commission's initiative to establish a single 
market for defence products as part of the Readiness 2030 programme. This could help 
lower unit costs in procurement. Estimates suggest that Europe loses out on as much 
as €57 billion–per year, that is–because we don't make the most of synergies and 
economies of scale.1
Needless to say, effective common defence involves far more than the joint 
procurement of armaments. Equipment, personnel and strategy have to be in 
alignment–and that's why they also need to be thought of, and developed as a whole. 
All the more so, given that technology and the deployment profiles of weapons systems 
are evolving at a breathtaking speed on account of the war in Ukraine. Procurement 
plans and processes, too, need to take account of this fast pace of change, the rapid 
obsolescence of systems that are considered state of the art today, and the enormous 
throughput of materials.
What matters now is to find suitable structures for this closer cooperation. The clock is 
ticking. We need to start making things happen. In this case, the solution cannot be to 
seek the lowest common denominator within theMember States that want to move  EU. 
ahead quickly should get together–ideally, with non-EUcountries that share the same  
security and defence interests. Because security issues do not stop at theEU's external  
border.

We now need to see whether the countries of Europe are willing to surrender powers in 
a sphere that is as sensitive as defence in order to achieve more together. That would 
also be the groundwork for joint financing. I am counting here on the strong political will 
in Europe to bite the bullet. The new security situation demands new answers.
3.2 Maximising the single market's potential
The second muscle we need to train is already fairly strong: our common European 
market–the world's biggest single market. It's a muscle we particularly need to build up 
in areas that are critical to success–areas in which we are currently reliant on providers 
outside Europe. Besides the defence sector, that is the case for some digital 
technologies, for example. Providing venture capital for innovative start-ups, or the 
world of payments, are other areas I could mention as well. 
That's why two areas of action are crucially important for me as a central banker: the 
savings and investments union, and the digital euro. We need both of these for various 
reasons, not least to unleash more competitiveness and growth in the European 
economy. But at the same time, they would also make a great deal of sense from a 
geostrategic perspective. Because they could make us less reliant on others and boost 
resilience.
The digital euro, for example, can reduce the currently still high degree of reliance on a 
handful of non-European enterprises in the field of electronic payments. At present, 
around two-thirds of card payments in the euro area are made via non-European 
providers such as Visa or Mastercard–meaning they are often routed through servers 
outside Europe. And ifUS dollar stablecoins were to spread, this could leave Europe    
more dependent still onUS firms.   
With the digital euro, we are helping Europe gain more sovereignty in a critical 
infrastructure. What is still lacking is a legal basis. The ball is now in the European 
Parliament's and the Council's court. I very much hope to see progress in this front 
soon.
4 Conclusion
Ladies and gentlemen,
Before our muscles begin to ache, I will conclude my speech. "Europe is an economic 
giant, a political dwarf and a military worm." Perhaps you'll be familiar with this remark 
by former Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens. He said that more than 30 years ago.
Tilting this imbalance was a desirable aim in the world 30 years ago. In today's world, it 
is imperative. Europe should rise to the geopolitical changes under its own 
steam–economically, politically and militarily. This calls for targeted muscle 
development. Looking at the weak points I mentioned earlier, we can see that the 
training is beginning to work. What matters now is to keep at it and make Europe fit for 
its new global role.
Thank you very much.
