Ladies and Gentlemen,   
I am pleased to attend this Eurofi Summit here in Warsaw – the birthplace of  
Marie Skłodowska-Curie, renowned French-Polish scientist and two-time Nobel 
laureate. A great European as well, currently among the shortlisted personalities 
to appear on future euro banknotes. Let me start with one strong belief on 
Europe, which is our common safe haven. In this newly chaotic world, we have 
an absolute duty and a unique opportun ity to enhance our economic power, 
which means accelerating on at least two positive solutions: (i) to build a digital 
euro to anchor our monetary sovereignty, in partnership with commercial banks, 
(ii) to have now  a comprehensive legislative package put f orward by the 
Commission to integrate more the Single market and the Savings and 
Investments Union, following the Draghi and Letta Reports. On both fronts, 
waiting in tetany or stupefaction would be lethal, and speed is of the essence: 
let us act faster and further.  
Coming back to science, financial stability and banking regulation must likewise 
be built on rigour – but also on clarity. In times of heightened uncertainty, we 
must not lose sight of the fundamental “ why” that underpins our regulatory 
architecture.   
I will first elaborate on three misconceptions and one rightful takeaway for 
simplification (I), before suggesting a few concrete milestones to go down the 
road (II).  
1. Three misconceptions and a rightful takeaway for simplification  
1.1. First misconception: we need US-like deregulation  
The first misconception would be to follow the path of deregulation.  Today, a 
strong wind is blowing from across the Atlantic with a dangerous temptation to 
forget the lessons of the 2008 global banking crisis.   
Deregulation would sow the seeds of future financial crises, still more at a time 
when crypto-assets and the growing role of non -bank financial intermediaries 
(NBFIs) are expanding the perimeter of systemic risk. Let me be clear, in case 
anyone here is still tempted to emulate the “example” set by M. Trump’s team: 

Page 2  
  
it would be a huge mistake. The Trump administration is heading down the 
wrong path with its economic and financial agenda – and the severe financial 
instability triggered after April 2nd is a clear demonstration thereof. We shouldn’t 
and we won’t enter a race to the bottom.   
1.2. Second misconception: nothing should change in Europe  
The second misconception, conversely, would be that nothing should change – 
that even modest adjustments w ould inevitably open the door to broader 
deregulation and bow to “banking sector lobbying”. This fear is unfounded: 
European regulators and supervisors are competent enough to know where to 
adjust, and where to stand firm. A decade after its inception, the Banking Union 
has become strong enough to acknowledge that there is room for possible 
improvement.  
Over the years, a growing number of requirements, guidelines and technical 
layers have been added to the framework.   
  
 
This is not simply the result of bureaucratic blindness that is all too easily vilified: 
the different European authorities are doing their job competently and 
conscientiously. But in Europe at least, there are structural causes. First, there 
is an accumulation of international, European a nd national standards, with the 

Page 3  
  
constant temptation to add more. Each country also wants to keep its previous 
rules, making it difficult to lighten the burden. There are also numerous bodies 
in charge – the SSM with its microprudential role, the ECB and th e European 
Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) with their macroprudential role, the SRM for 
resolution, European agencies including the European Banking Authority (EBA) 
for banks, and various national authorities.  
1.3. Third misconception: we should still add requirements on European 
banks  
The weakness of this European architecture is that no single authority is truly 
responsible for taking a holistic view on the appropriate level of capital. And 
there is possibly an assumption that more capital is always better, regardless of 
context or calibration. This dynamic is often driven by siloed optimisation: each 
authority, acting with the best of intentions, introduces additional layers of 
safeguards. Such “local” optimisation can lead to a suboptimal race to the top.   
But the reality is that European banks as a whole do not lack capital or liquidity. 
On the contrary, over the past decade, the average CET1 ratio of European 
banks has increased from 12.5% to 16.1%.

Their resilience has been repeatedly tested and con firmed – recently through 
the 2023 stress testing exercises, which are credible, and well -recognised by 
markets, based on a very severe scenario, corresponding to a drop in the GDP 
approximately twice as strong as during the Great Recession. Moreover, the 
current 2025 exercise will anchor this credibility, as it is based on a narrative of 
worsening geopolitical tensions, with large, negative, and persistent trade and 
confidence shocks.  
1.4. A rightful takeaway: we need a European approach to simplification  
These three misconceptions lead us to a more grounded conclusion: the need 
for a European approach to simplification that is firm on objectives, but more 
nimble in design. The difference from deregulation is threefold:  
First, we stick to the fundamental objectives: financial stability must remain 
paramount. The cost of banking crises is too highi to be treated lightly. The same 
holds true for climate change, which is no longer a distant risk but an economic 
reality.ii One word about the objective of competitiveness: it is important for the 
industry, and rightly so; but there is a hierarchy of objectives. Just as in monetary 
policy, price stability is the primary objective, preceding growth support, financial 
stability must remain our primary objective. In sofar it is ensured, we should 
indeed support competitiveness.  
Second, we stick to the international standards: Basel 3 for the banks, FSB 
guidelines for non -banks and cryptos. Most jurisdictions implement them: the 
new US unilateralism is the exception, and cannot become the rule.  
Third, simplification is about diminishing complexity , and not necessarily 
diminishing requirements. We must examine how rules interact, how they are 
applied, and whether their combined and holistic effect truly serves their 
intended purpose. This applies to both regulation and supervision. Simplification 
is not a softening of our ambition but a way to make it more effective.   
2. Going down the road of simplification: concrete milestones

Let me in this spirit lay down a few concrete milestones towards a European 
simplification.  
2.1 Short term: supervision and reporting – including ESG  
In the short term, there are opportunities to reduce the administrative burden for 
banks and competent authorities. On supervision, we welcome the SSM’s  
“SREP of tomorrow” initiative and the work on reporting simplification. They are 
important steps forward, and they must now be fully delivered and enhanced. In 
parallel, the EBA has launched concrete efforts to rationalise Level 2 and 3 texts, 
as well as reporting requirements, with practical actions to be taken by the end 
of 2025. I also welcome the Commission’s decision to bring forward to 2026 the 
report on the state of the banking system in the single market, with a focus on 
competitiveness.  
On ESG reporting, the Omnibus directive’s direction of travel is encouraging. 
The reduction in reporting burden is welcome – but we can finetune the right 
balance, especially on CSRD. In particular, for mid -sized companies (from 250 
to 1,000 employees) an appropriate reporting framework is still to be defined. 
Moreover, the upcoming streamlining of the first set of ESRS standards  
prepared by EFRAG should still contain the most necessary data to address 
climate-related financial risks, such as information regarding entities’ transition 
plan. Indeed, we strongly support the development of credible transition plans 
for financial inst itutions. In this regard, achieving consistency between CSRD 
and CSDDD is a major step forward. The deferral of sectoral rules at this stage 
is, in my view, a sensible and proportionate choice.   
2.2. Medium term: regulation  
Quick wins matter – but we must also keep the broader perspective in view.  
As underlined last February in our joint letter to the Commission with the 
Governors of the Bundesbank, Banca d’Italia and Banco de España iii, 
simplification must begin with a holistic assessment of the present framework.

This could lead afterwards to constructive discussion of Level 1 texts, and a 
critical review of gold-plating and Europe-specific layers of complexity.  
While we should not pre -empt the outcome of this review, a number of 
wellknown candidates f or simplification already stand out in my opinion. First, 
on resolution, the coexistence of TLAC and MREL requirements, which is a 
clear case of gold -plating and complexity. Then, the multiplication of MDA 
triggers, which generates uncertainty for capital planning. In particular, the 
removal of the MREL and leverage ratio -based MDA triggers deserves serious 
consideration. Beyond these, ambition in simplifying should be maintained even 
on more complex topics such as th e structure of the capital stack, and in 
particular, the macroprudential architecture.   
On Basel 3, I am and remain a great supporter of its implementation, with one 
exception: it is appropriate to postpone by one more year to 2027 the 
implementation of the fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB) given the 
international uncertainty. This delay should be used to adjust some of the design 
of the FRTB. Lastly, current European discussions on the output floor’s impact 
on the P2R should be in line with th e spirit of the level 1 text and avoid 
goldplating.  
*  
To conclude, we can be proud of what has been achieved since the 2008 crisis: 
the European banking system is now more robust, better capitalised, subject to 
stronger and more coordinated supervision, giving us greater confidence as we 
face today’s uncertainties. We can now turn to what remains to be done: 
reducing the complexity of our framework without weakening it. Simplifying does 
not mean lowering our guard – it means strengthening our foundations.  Let us 
discuss it together, with a bit less passion and mutual suspicion, and a bit more 
pragmatic action. As Marie Curie said: “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only 
to be understood.” We must show less fears, and more mutual understanding.  
This is, contrary to the latest US drift, the European way I believe in.
