Olli Rehn: Old and new frontiers of the ESRB - systemic risk, non-
banks and data analysis
Keynote speech by Mr Olli Rehn, Governor of the Bank of Finland and First Vice-Chair 
of the European Systemic Risk Board, at the 8th ESRB annual conference "New 
Frontiers in Macroprudential Policy", Frankfurt am Main, 27 September 2024.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,
Good morning everyone!
May I also welcome you all and thank the secretariat for putting together an impressive 
programme for this ESRB flagship event.
Today, I would like to reflect on the role of the ESRB and its mandate regarding 
financial stability and macroprudential policy in the EU.
Slide 2:The ESRB's track record & new frontiers 
I will discuss three interlinked issues. Firstly, the ESRB at 15, an adolescent, with a 
solid record. Secondly, key starting points for the forthcoming ESRB review. And thirdly, 
new frontiers, especially dealing with non-banks and better use of data and analysis.
Let's look at where we have come from. Since the global financial crisis, major efforts 
have been made to ensure financial stability in the EU and globally through better 
regulation and supervision. I think it is indeed fair to say thathas  financialstability   
risen forcefully up the agenda of central banks, not least as it provides essential support 
for the central banks' primary goal of . pricestability 
In recent years, financial systems and financial stability measures have been subject to 
real-life stress tests, with the global economy being hit by a series of major shocks over 
just a short period of time. Primarily, that is, the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's illegal, 
brutal war in Ukraine, the surge in inflation and the sharp rise in interest rates.
In my view, the financial systems in the EU and elsewhere have withstood these shocks 
rather well. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision points out that the strong 
resilience has been largely thanks to the tightened capital and liquidity requirements for 
banks.
Slide 3:Sturdy capital buffers provide banking resilience 
True, the capital ratios of European banks have roughly doubled since the global 
financial crisis. The increased capital buffers have been – and will continue to be – 
necessary in the current operating environment, which is filled with geopolitical and 
other uncertainties.

2/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
I would add that the active use of macroprudential policy has further supported the 
resilience of the financial system in Europe.
As part of its mandate, the ESRB assesses systemic risks in the EU, and, where 
appropriate, issues warnings and recommendations.
Slide 4: Key risks for EU financial stability
In our recent systemic risk assessment, we conclude that while disinflation in the EU is 
on track, financial stability risks remain elevated amid heightened geopolitical risks and 
the still fragile recovery of the EU economy. In the latest ECB projection, growth outlook 
was revised down, and the risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the downside.
In particular, we have to be aware of both theand impacts of direct   indirect   current 
on the EU financial system. Geopolitical events mayimpact geopolitical risks   directly 
financial markets by increasing volatility, affecting capital flows, exchange rates, and 
credit spreads. , they can disrupt global trade and increase commodity prices,  Indirectly
challenging households and businesses in the EU.
In the financial markets, the risk appetite has been unusually strong, especially in the 
context of high macro-financial uncertainty. The abrupt, albeit short-lived, market 
correction in early August showed how sensitive this can be. If repeated, the 
vulnerabilities in the non-bank sector could amplify adverse market dynamics.
Moreover, vulnerabilities in the banking sector could resurface, especially if the first two 
risks were to materialise. This would increase credit risks and tighten funding conditions 
at the same time.
In any case, it continues to be essential to maintain the resilience of the EU financial 
system. Ensuring adequate resilience and effective but flexible regulation is one 
building block in promoting European competitiveness, along the lines of the recent 
report by Mario Draghi. As part of the efforts for more investment and higher 
productivity, it is crucial to advance – or the ex- the savings and investment union 
capital market union – and to complete the banking union.
Slide 5: ESRB's members reflect on its future – ATC survey
Fifteen years ago, the global financial crisis revealed weaknesses in EU banking 
supervision. It was clear that major changes to financial supervision were necessary to 
help prevent and mitigate future crises.
Thus, Commission President José Manuel Barroso set up an independent High Level 
Group on Financial Supervision in the EU to make recommendations on strengthening 
European supervisory arrangements, covering all financial sectors.
The High Level Group, chaired by Jacques de Larosière, was given a very broad 
mandate and very little time. In only three months, the Group delivered an important 
and insightful report. It provided the basis not only for establishing the ESRB but the 
whole European System of Financial Supervision, including the European Supervisory 
Authorities.

3/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
One of the key conclusions of the report was that regulators and supervisors had not 
sufficiently focused on " of a contagion of correlated the macro-systemic risks 
horizontal shocks". As a policy response, de Larosière proposed establishing the ESRB 
(or the European Systemic Risk Council as he then called it).
As a member of the European Commission at that time, I had the privilege of being 
present at the ESRB's creation, specifically by preparing with my team the legislative 
proposals for setting up the ESRB, while my dear colleague Michel Barnier introduced 
the legislation for the European System of Financial Supervision. The legislative 
process was swift. The General Board of the ESRB held its inaugural meeting in the 
Eurotower in January 2011.
Given the constantly evolving environment, it is necessary to review the mandate and 
workings of the ESRB from time to time. The Commission is now tasked – for the 
second time – with reporting to the European Parliament and to the Council on the 
review of the ESRB.
While the ESRB will not take a formal position on its founding regulation, it believes it is 
important that the legislator has the opportunity to benefit from the experience of those 
who have been deeply involved in the work of the ESRB. For this purpose, the ESRB 
has set up a High Level Group to (i) identify which adjustments to the mission or 
framework of the ESRB might be required and to (ii) provide its insights to the EU co-
legislators before the review process. I have the honour of chairing the Group.
Let me give you an interim snapshot of the key issues in the review.
First, as part of the High Level Group's work we have been seeking feedback more 
broadly from the ESRB membership by way of a survey among the members of the 
Advisory Technical Committee on how the ESRB has succeeded in its core tasks over 
the years. We have also sought to explore whether the current operating model of the 
ESRB is fit for purpose and how the ESRB and its tasks should be renewed and 
developed as the financial system evolves.
The feedback received from the members of the ATC has been most valuable. It 
indicates that the current model and mandate of the ESRB do not need a complete 
overhaul but rather some targeted adjustment.
The work done by the ESRB over the years is considered especially valuable with 
regard to the definition of macroprudential policies and the development of a 
for macroprudential policies in Europe, particularly in the comprehensive framework 
banking sector.
And this work has had a significant impact:, through its determined efforts, the ESRB  
has helped to pre-emptively identify and mitigate the build-up of systemic risks in 
.Europe
Going forward, the ESRB could, in my view, play an even stronger role in the holistic 
. The ESRB has a unique ability to examine analysis of systemic risks within the EU
cross-sectoral, cross-border and interlinked risks – and the truly systemic dimension of 
these risks.

The ESRB is also in an excellent position to work with academia and international 
organisations. A particular advantage for the ESRB is that the European Supervisory 
Authorities (the EBA, ESMA and EIOPA) participate in our work and provide their own 
perspectives. It is crucial that their expertise will continue to support the work of the 
ESRB.
Leading on from this, I would like to call for deeper collaboration at the EU level on

Imbalance Procedure.
In particular, the ESRB has been developing the concept of macroprudential policy 
to analyse the way in which national authorities are using macroprudential tools stance 
to mitigate the systemic risks to which their financial sector is exposed. A deepening of 
EU collaboration in this field would contribute to strengthening economic stability in a 
particular Member State and/or the EU in its entirety.

The ESRB has already engaged in risk monitoring and analysis of the non-bank 
and has identified many structural vulnerabilities that require our attention. But sector 
more work is needed to better understand the systemic risks of the non-bank sector in 
the same depth as those for the banks. This is important not only for financial stability, 
but also for ensuring a solid basis for the saving and investment union.
Let me underline the critical importance of data – access to data, better use of data – in 
the analysis of non-banks. To understand the systemic risks related to NBFIs, we 
simply need better data to be able to identify and map the vulnerabilities and 
interconnections. Only once that's done, we will be able to capitalize on more advanced 
methods, such as system wide stress-testing, to locate the vulnerabilities in the system.

Dear Friends,
Slide 6: Three priorities in the way we work
Before concluding, I'd like to highlight three priorities for the way we work in the coming 
years that I find critical for the ESRB. We should:
Enhance our analytical capacity by making better use of data and research.
Bring into use new analysis methods and technologies.

Focus on our core activities.
Let me just elaborate on these a little more.
Slide 7: Analysis based on data and research – a key priority
Active development of data analytics and research-driven analysis is nothing 
new at the ESRB as such.
But I firmly believe that the importance of analysis which is based on data and 
, where disinformation is being research cannot be overemphasized in our times
used as a weapon. In today's world, there is a great risk that genuine information will be 
crowded out.
Data is the gold or oil of our digital world today – it is a valuable resource and a 
necessary basis for high-level analysis. Following the global financial crisis, the 
reporting requirements for financial operators were increased. Financial supervisors 
and central banks consequently also have a duty to use the new data effectively and 
.efficiently
The challenge for the ESRB is that not all relevant data are readily available to it. The 
rules governing the ESRB's access to data can be broadly divided into two types:
ex ante access, whereby the ESRB has access to data on a regular, ongoing 
basis, as soon as it is reported. We already benefit from quite a few datasets 
under this framework, which is well aligned with our mandate and tasks.
ex post access, through ad hoc requests, which take time to process. For some 
important datasets we have only ex post access. This includes granular datasets 
collected by the ESAs.
While cooperation regarding data sharing between the ESAs and the ESRB has been 
excellent, the ex post framework has inherent limitations that hamper the ESRB's ability 
to continuously monitor and mitigate risks to financial stability.
For this reason, the ESRB sent a letter last month to European co-legislators, urging 
them to broaden the ESRB's access to information from supervisors, so that the data 
can be shared with the ESRB by default.
This is extremely important for the ESRB to be able to effectively fulfil its mandate in 
assessing the systemic risks and to promptly react in instances of projected instability.
As the volume of data increases, we must alsoinvest in new high-level analysis  
. Modern methods of risk assessment make use of advanced tools and methods
technologies, such as AI and machine learning, which enable better forecasting and 
analysis. With these technologies, it is possible to process large amounts of data.
Finally, to focus on our core activities has been rightly underlined both by the other High 
Level Group members and in the ESRB member feedback. We should, in my view too, 
even in the midst of various crises. We cannot be experts focus on our core activities 
in everything, and nor do we need to be. The added value that we bring as an 

6/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
organisation should focus on the area where we are the best experts:  level systemic 
risk analysis of the system. financial 
Our added value should always come from a deep understanding of vulnerabilities and 
interconnections in the financial system and of the various factors that get amplified 
when shocks hit the system.
Dear Friends,
Let me now conclude.
In the grand scheme of things, financial stability fundamentally depends on the 
geopolitical and macroeconomic context. The best service for EU financial stability now 
is to maintain European unity and firmly support Ukraine in the face of Russia's threat.
Furthermore, it is crucial to strengthen the structural foundations of the European 
economy, by focusing policy actions on productivity growth and industrial 
competitiveness, while retaining the European model of social inclusion.
On its part, the European Systemic Risk Board, together with the ESAs, the SSM, the 
FSAs and the central banks, continues to play a strong role in safeguarding the stability 
of the EU financial system. Our work will focus on the evolving systemic risk and will be 
based on comprehensive data and research, high-quality analysis and wide-ranging 
cooperation between different authorities.
I look forward to continuing to work with you towards this immensely important goal of 
maintaining financial stability in Europe.
Thank you for your kind attention!
