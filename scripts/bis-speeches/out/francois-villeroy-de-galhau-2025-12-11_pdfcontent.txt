About our monetary policy: A good
position but not a comfortable, nor a
fixed one

Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am delighted to welcome you today to the Banque de France for the
fourth edition of the annual CEPR symposium, a great opportunity for
academics and policymakers to share knowledge. We’ve just heard
Philippe Aghion, Nobel laureate 2025, challenge us with bold ideas on
innovation and growth. Now, let me lay the necessary foundation which
is trust and price stability: how does monetary policy navigate today’s
uncertainties?
Three years after reaching its peak, inflation is currently at 2.2% in the
euro area and has been very close to target since May 2025.  Thanks to
the credibility and effective action of the European Central Bank, this
disinflation was achieved without triggering a recession, an outcome
many observers had considered unlikely. We are, as President Christine
Lagarde has observed, “in a good place”. But a good position is not a
comfortable one nor a fixed one, as I will discuss today. 
I. Not a comfortable position: dealing
with uncertainty
i

Claiming to be in a comfortable position in such an uncomfortable world
would obviously be excessive. Uncertainty has eased but remains high:
AI valuations, fiscal and political instability, trade shifts, geopolitical
tensions, and doubts over the US dollar’s global role keep CEOs and
policymakers awake. Many of these uncertainties are “Knightian”, for
which there is no well-defined set of probabilities over different
outcomes. As inflation and economic conditions become less
predictable, there are diverging assessments on the state of the
economy and risks across agents. And when investors hold diverging
views, markets are less likely to stabilize. Consider recent developments
in bond markets on the one hand and in equity markets, on the other
hand. With rising market perceptions of fiscal risks, we see tensions at
the very long end of yield curve. At the same time, the stock market has
been outperforming, with high price-to-earnings ratio and compressed
credit spreads. Overall, this suggests some optimism in the short-to-
medium-term but concerns on the longer term. 
A well-known tendency when faced by uncertainty is cautious action,
invoking Brainard’ principle in monetary policy.  Yet Banque de France
research shows this can be counterproductive if agents expect
systematic under-reaction to inflation shocks. In Bernanke’s words:
“Brainard's attenuation principle may not always hold […] stronger action
by the central bank may be warranted to prevent particularly costly
outcomes.”
  
A risk-management approach to uncertainty: Agile pragmatism, forward-
looking with scenario analysis.
Hence, our repeated commitment to a “data-dependent, meeting-by-
meeting approach”: it’s more than a mantra; it’s my favourite notion of
“agile pragmatism". Data-dependency means pragmatism: our reaction is
state-contingent – where the state includes not only current economic
conditions but also the outlook and the balance of risks.
 
And meeting-by-meeting means agility. But meeting-by-meeting doesn’t
mean ignoring the future. Transmission lags make forward-looking
analysis essential, which is why our projections play a crucial role in the
ii

decision-making process. But we also have to think about how robust
our decisions are to plausible and policy-relevant future shocks that may
occur during those lags. This is where scenario analysis becomes
valuable.
Banque de France staff research   is developing an example of monetary
policy risk-management framework informed by a range of scenarios.
Let me illustrate: last June, ECB staff provided two different risk
scenarios around the baseline, shown in Chart 1.a. 
Optimal monetary policy across scenarios
Each scenario implies a different optimal policy path, as shown in Chart
1.b. Our framework then allows assigning weights not only to alternative
scenarios but also to the baseline, as reported in Chart 2.a.

These weights are assigned based on their relevance according to the
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). Accordingly, we can design a
“synthetic” scenario as the weighted average of the baseline and the two
alternative risk scenarios. Chart 2.b. shows the resulting synthesis.
Despite different optimal paths under the scenarios, the synthetic path
aligns very closely with the optimal path under the baseline. This is due
to the low probability assigned to the more extreme scenario. In short,
while an extreme tariff shock would justify looser policy, its low
plausibility means little need for extra insurance now.
That said, many questions remain open on scenarios. Who selects and
prepares them? And beyond that, how should we use them? Two main
options exist to derive a single policy decision from a range of scenarios:
one is to synthetise scenario results using techniques like Bayesian
synthesis – as illustrated above – and model averaging; and the other is
to select the policy path that avoids the worst outcome across scenarios
following a robust control approach. Both have pros and cons. Broadly
speaking, I would say that scenario synthesis should be the preferred
option, while robust control remains valuable when facing extreme risks
whose plausibility is difficult to gauge. In that case the policy maker
might be more concerned with taking out insurance against the “bad
state” of the world.
 
Such “what if?” exercises also help illustrate how the central bank might
respond to shocks, allowing agents to learn about the policy rule from
plausible – not just observed – decisions. Of course, such descriptions
must remain indicative, and not committing.
In its November 2025 Monetary Policy Report, the Bank of England has
interestingly integrated scenarios into monetary policy council
discussions and communications. Minutes, reports, and press releases
use scenarios to highlight risks around key policy judgments and to
explain alternative policy paths assuming each scenario occurs. Board
members use scenarios to explain their decision within the monetary
council.   As you know, we in the Eurosystem prefer that decisions are
communicated without attributing individual views to encourage
completely open discussions and preserve collegiality. But we could use
v

scenarios more.
Communication under uncertainty
The academic literature has found that monetary policy uncertainty
heightens market interest rate sensitivity to macroeconomic surprises .
 We cannot, of course, reduce the fundamental economic and
geopolitical uncertainty. But central banks can reduce monetary
uncertainty about their future decisions through efficient
communication, by enhancing economic agents’ perceptions of the
policy framework. 
In a context of high uncertainty, we need to combine a hard commitment
to the 2% symmetric inflation target and a soft guidance on the interest
rate path. Soft guidance is not the kind of almost unconditional and “long
horizon” forward guidance we have used at the ELB. Nor should soft
guidance be interpreted as static. After our June and July meetings,
markets had the wrong perception of the ECB having necessarily
reached the terminal rate. This has contributed to a somewhat undesired
tightening of FCI (Chart 3.a) and, since last June, the sensitivity of
expected rates to expected inflation has diminished (Chart 3.b).
Expectations and perception of the reaction function
vi

Soft signaling is our everyday life business, in which we influence market
expectations of future near-term policy but keep optionality.
 
Furthermore, I am convinced that we must openly address all other
sources of economic uncertainty with a broader and bolder
communication beyond monetary policy . Today, uncertainty stems
primarily from deteriorating public finances, and missed opportunities for
structural reforms. If we don’t advocate a full implementation of the
Draghi and Letta reports by the 1/1/28, including “a 28  regime for
2028”, who will? A remarkable move in this direction is Christine
Lagarde’s recent speech in Frankfurt: “Another six years of inaction – and
lost growth – would not just be disappointing. It would be irresponsible."
II. Nor a fixed position: navigating the
road ahead
At the current juncture, our good position is not either a fixed one. Let
me first dispel three main misconceptions I sometimes hear about our
reaction function.
1.    Three misconceptions about our reaction function
vii
th
viii

The ECB would have gone back to “below but close to 2%”
The first misconception is about an alleged asymmetry of our reaction
function. Some believe we would tolerate inflation to go below but close
to 2% for a prolonged period of time. In our strategy review since 2021,
as reaffirmed in 2025, we strongly stated that our inflation target is fully
symmetric. Positive and negative deviations from 2%, if lasting, are
equally undesirable. Let me be clear: we are not “keeping our powder
dry” to create a buffer with the effective lower bound. 
The bar for changing rates would have increased
 
Second, some might think that we should react only to large deviations
from the target and ignore small ones. But as I already stressed , what
matters is not the size of the deviation, it is whether it is temporary or
persistent. Even small but lasting deviations can affect the anchoring of
inflation expectations. This is why we need to analyse thoroughly the
effect of each shock, to decide whether to look through or act pre-
emptively. Agility is not excessive policy activism, but it is not stickiness
either.
The ECB could not decouple from the Fed
Finally, considering the Fed’s recent easing, and with an opposite
mistaken view, some recommend that the ECB follow suit, but wrongly
so. Remember Spring 2024, there was a symmetric debate about
whether the ECB could truly cut its policy rates before the Fed. And the
ECB did it (Chart 4.a). 
ix

ECB independence and decoupling
Despite this decoupling, the exchange rate market absorbed this without
turbulence, as it happened on several other occasions over the past
decade. 
Moreover, let me remind the obvious: we are already significantly more
accommodative than the US. Our deposit facility rate is at 2%, close to
estimates of the natural rate, our balance sheet size is 38% of GDP [Q3
2025], whereas it is 22% of GDP in the US [Q2 2025] (Chart 4.b). The 10-
year OIS stands at about 2.5% in the euro area, compared to about 3.5%
in the US.
 
2.    Some thoughts on Quantitative Normalisation
There have also been mistaken suggestions that because the Fed has
concluded the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings, we should
do the same. Nevertheless, this raises a more serious question about the
right size of our balance sheet. I agree with my colleague Isabel
Schnabel that the word “Quantitative tightening” is misleading about the
present process: we should speak of “Quantitative normalisation” (QN)   .
But until when and to what size? We will discuss next year about the
implementation of our operational framework introduced in September
2024, but let me share two considerations:

-    We should maintain ample liquidity in the European banking
system. At present, it is still abundant, with our excess liquidity
of about EUR 2,500 bn. It is to be compared with the necessary
level of liquidity to have money market rates anchored to the
floor policy rates, namely FREL (Floor Required Excess Liquidity)
which is estimated on average at about EUR 1,500 bn, with
however a wide confidence interval around this average (Chart
5.b). 
Balance sheet normalisation
But if we were to come to a situation of scarcer liquidity in the euro area,
or perceived as such by banks, it would risk provoking an undue credit
tightening, as well as an unlevel playing field with international banks.
-    Liquidity, as we all know, can be provided “on demand”,
through short-term refinancing operations, and/or through
structural operations of the Eurosystem, including longer term
refinancing operations and a structural portfolio. Short-term
refinancing will regain part of its pre-GFC importance, but we
also need to build a structural portfolio for at least two reasons:
refinancing operations could still be associated for banks with a
stigma effect; there is a need for the central bank to remain
present on the bonds market, even above the ELB, for several
reasons (transmission of monetary policy, climate change, etc.).

3.    The name of the game is full optionality
Euro area annual inflation reached 2.2% in November, according to the
flash estimate released on Tuesday. This remains a good position, for the
seventh month in a row. This average hides nevertheless two paradoxes.
 
This stability encompasses inflation dispersion across countries
There is significant heterogeneity between countries, between low
inflation in France (0.8%) or Italy (1.1%) and still elevated inflation in
Germany (2.6%) and Spain (3.1%). This heterogeneity is mainly driven by
the price of services: countries with low inflation in services are those
with the lowest total inflation rates (Chart. 6.a).
Inflation dispersion in Europe
Differences in service inflation are themselves largely due to wage
dynamics (Chart 6.b). In Germany, with infrequent wage negotiations,
wages are late in catching up with past inflation, compared to France,
with annual negotiations and an indexed minimum wage. Once the
catching-up is over in each country, we can hope we will see an
evolution towards lower inflation rates in the services sector in the euro
area.

These apparently stable inflation data are surrounded by significant risks
on the inflation outlook.
This is the present paradox: stable data, but significant risks. There are
upside risks on inflation, such as global value chain fragmentation, and
public spending in defence and infrastructure in Germany. There are
downside risks as well: a greater deceleration of wage growth, a
stronger euro, and cheaper imports from China. Over the latest six
months this year compared to the same period last year (May-to-
October 2025 vs 2024), Chinese imports in the euro area increased by
11% in volume, and their price decreased by 9%. To give an order of
magnitude, the last two phenomena could reduce inflation by about 0.2
percentage point in 2027 according to Banque de France estimates. The
postponement of ETS2 to 2028, voted by the European Parliament, will
also post-pone its inflationary impact of around a 1/4 of percentage point
from 2027 to 2028. To these “traditional” downside risks, we should add
a systemic “Knightian” one with financial instability due to global equity
market valuations, private credit and high government debts.
Furthermore, this financial instability could be triggered by the attacks to
the credibility and independence of the Fed.
Bottom line: (i) the downside risks on the inflation outlook remain at least
as significant as the upside risks, and we would not tolerate a lasting
undershooting of our inflation target; (ii) the name of the game for our
future meetings remains full optionality. The only fixed figure is our 2%
inflation target; it is not any terminal interest rate, and we don’t exclude
any policy action.

In the battle to reach the inflation target, we have finally taken the lead,
and this is no small achievement. But being ahead doesn’t give us
permission to relax.  As the French tennis champion René Lacoste used
to say: “If you’re on the cusp of winning, remember that there is no
opponent who plays better than an opponent who is about to lose”. As in
a tennis match, it’s not the last shot that matters, it is the next one. We
must not stay fixed on the court and should anticipate how the game
could evolve. In other words, agility is at the crossroads of two other
virtues: extreme clarity about our determination to deliver the 2%
inflation target; pragmatic humility and optionality about our next shots
to that end. 
 

 In October 2022 the year-on-year HICP Inflation rate reached the peak
level of 10.6% in the Euro Area. In May 2025, inflation was 1.9% and never
went below 1.9% or above 2.2% since.
