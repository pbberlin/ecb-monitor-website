SPEECH
Monetary policy under uncertainty
Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board
of the ECB, at the Bank of England Watchers’ Conference 2024,
King’s College London
London, 25 November 2024
Introduction
My aim today is to explain how uncertainty is incorporated in the monetary policy process at the EcB.4
[4] While monetary policy makers have always had to grapple with uncertainty, recent years have been
marked by a pronounced increase in the quantum of uncertainty. This includes the uncertainties related
to the pandemic and the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine (Chart 1). It also includes the
uncertainties related to technological change, geo-economic trends and the green transition. In this
speech, | will discuss how the ECB incorporates risk and uncertainty in its forecasting, in the
preparation of monetary policy decisions and in communication.

Uncertainty”, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 131, No. 4, pp. 1593-1636.


Events such as the global financial crisis, the pandemic and wars are inherently unpredictable. And,
even once such an event has occurred, its ultimate impact on the economy is very difficult to work out.
A prime example is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. By triggering extraordinary jumps in gas and oil
prices, and by creating a generalised sense of insecurity, this conflict was a major driver of the recent
surge in inflation and also brought geo-political risk considerations to the fore. The scale and duration
of the conflict have had wider ramifications for the euro area economy, also prompting difficult
questions about the appropriate scale of defence spending and the management of the economic and
social impact of refugee flows.
One “uncertainty tracker” is the risk index developed by ECB staff based on importance of the different
risks articulated in the earnings calls of publicly-traded euro area companies (Chart 2). While this
summary indicator shows some decline in risk intensity recently, primarily due to a decline in
uncertainty related to macroeconomic developments and supply chain disruptions, it remains above
pre-pandemic levels.2!

Guillotin, J. and Neves, P. (2024), “Insights from earnings calls — what can we learn from corporate risk
perceptions and sentiment?”, Economic Bulletin, |lssue 4, ECB.
Yet even in quieter periods not featuring extraordinary events, uncertainty is an inherent aspect of
decision making in economics. The fundamental unpredictability of the future creates a cone of multiple
possible outcomes, each with its own set of implications. Uncertainty may also stem from environments
that cannot be observed or characterised in their entirety when incomplete information adds another
layer of unpredictability.
There is a long history to the challenge of incorporating uncertainty into economic decision making.
Economists and policymakers have long recognised that the economy is subject to shocks and that


human behaviour, which underpins economic activity and shapes collective reactions to the shocks, is
inherently unpredictable.
Some economists have argued that individuals and markets can, on average, formulate an accurate
risk distribution over future events by using all available information. tn this way, uncertainty can be
captured in standard macroeconomic models by the use of probability distributions around different
outcomes or scenarios, which can either be measured directly or estimated (for example, from financial
options markets). Even when risks can be measured and quantified, the way in which this affects
economic decisions may be highly complex and non-linear, as emphasised by complexity theory!
In this context, it can be useful to distinguish between what is often called ‘risk’ — which can be
modelled via known calculable probabilities — and Knightian uncertainty, where there is no objective
basis for deriving probabilities and one may not even be able to delineate the space of all the
circumstances that can occur. Under this Knightian form of uncertainty, risks are not known or even
knowable, making them impossible to quantify and forecast. This distinction has its foundations in
seminal works by Frank Knight and John Maynard Keynes.
Decision-making under this type of uncertainty may not be well captured by our standard models. For
example, developments in behavioural economics have shown that cognitive biases can significantly
affect decision-making under uncertainty.“! Other strands of research have demonstrated that relying
on simple heuristics can be a boundedly-rational response in complex environments.“ Under this type
of uncertainty, the development of scenarios, and application of judgment about possible outcomes in
the future, can complement models and help policymakers adjust and adapt policy action when
needed.
These considerations highlight the importance of practitioners taking a nuanced approach towards risk
management. A comprehensive approach calls for the adoption of robust strategies consistent with a
wide range of risk scenarios. In addition, policy should acknowledge the limits of predictability and
follow an adaptive approach, leaving enough room for manoeuvre when faced with genuine surprises.
[11]
With this in mind, | will use the remainder of my time to explain the broad range of strategies that are
used at the ECB to quantify and incorporate risk and uncertainty into macroeconomic forecasting and in
making monetary policy decisions. | will also discuss how risk and uncertainty are articulated in the
monetary policy communication of the ECB.
Uncertainty about the economy and monetary transmission
The inflation surges in the euro area during 2021 and 2022 resulted from a sequence of large shocks,
which also precipitated a significant burst of uncertainty. These shocks related both to the longer-term
fallout from the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with demand rotating across sectors in
an environment in which some key segments of the economy were supply constrained. In addition, the
war-induced subsequent surges in energy prices infiltrated the entire price chain.
Macroeconomic projections are a key input to forward-looking monetary policy decision making. But
forecasting models — which embed economic relations based on historical regularities and typically


struggle to handle pervasive uncertainty — naturally faced significant challenges during this period.
From the middle of 2021 to early 2023, this challenge was visible in the scale of realised forecast errors
for both headline and core inflation, as well as real GDP growth (Chart 3). During this period, the
significant forecast inaccuracies were driven by pandemic-related bottlenecks and the dramatic surges
in energy and commodity prices. But shifts in how these shocks were transmitted to inflation, including
owing partly to pandemic reopening effects, also played an important role in the broadening of the
inflation shock, increasing its size and persistence./4]

Notes: An error is defined as the outturn for a given quarter minus the projection made for that quarter in the
previous quarter (for example, the outturn for the fourth quarter of 2022 minus the figure projected for that quarter
in the September 2022 ECB staff macroeconomic projections). The latest observations are for the September 2024
ECB staff macroeconomic projections.
Faced with these major events that challenged our existing processes, models and forecasts, the ECB
has developed strategies to support decision-making in managing and mitigating uncertainty. | turn to
these strategies in the next section.
The three-pronged reaction function
In general, central banks make monetary policy decisions on the basis of two factors: first, the “most
likely” (or baseline) projection for inflation and output; and, second, the risk profile surrounding this
expected path. In guiding the disinflation process since the inflation peak in late 2022, the most
prominent risks facing the ECB were: (i) in the context of extraordinarily-high inflation, there was a wide


distribution of possible inflation paths, such that the weight attached to the baseline projection in
updating beliefs about inflation dynamics was naturally lower than normal, with a corresponding step up
in the attention paid to the realised path of underlying inflation; and (ii) in the context of a steep rate
hiking cycle (especially after an extended low-for-long monetary environment), there was considerable
uncertainty about the strength of monetary policy transmission. These risks were best managed by
adopting a three-pronged reaction function encompassing both information from staff projections and
cross-checking information from a variety of sources. Since March 2023, the Governing Council has
communicated that it is particularly attentive to: (i) the implications of the incoming economic and
financial data for the inflation outlook; (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation; and (iii) the strength of
monetary policy transmission.“
This strategy has proved its value in ensuring an orderly disinflation process by setting the interest rate
path to deliver a timely return of inflation to the target. In particular, by systematically considering all
three elements of the reaction function and weighting them appropriately, the Governing Council could
better calibrate monetary policy in the face of unpredictable, sometimes contradictory information.“41
This three-pronged reaction function can be understood as a heuristic for simultaneously managing
multiple sources of uncertainty during the disinflation process, both in relation to inflation dynamics and
the transmission of monetary policy.“
The inflation outlook
The first element of the reaction function is the inflation outlook, which can be understood to
encompass both the “most likely” future path for inflation and the surrounding risk assessment. The
assessment of the inflation outlook is based on the incoming economic and financial data. The
quarterly staff macroeconomic projection exercise is a central input into this assessment, as it
aggregates a vast amount of information that would otherwise be hard to map into a coherent profile of
the future path for inflation and output. At the “in between” non-projection meetings, the incoming
information is best interpreted through the lens of the latest projection round, either validating or casting
doubt on these projections. In synthesis, our assessment evolves according to a Bayesian-style
updating process, with priors at inter-projection meetings pinned down by the latest projections and
incoming statistics helping to update the picture. Chart 4 shows the path of inflation as foreseen in the
September staff projections.

Underlying inflation
Measures of underlying inflation provide a useful alternative perspective in assessing inflation
dynamics, especially in times of elevated uncertainty.“ Measures of underlying inflation aim to filter
out the short-term volatility in headline inflation to better capture the low-frequency component of
inflation. Accordingly, such measures provide a sense of where headline inflation is likely to settle in the
medium term, once temporary factors have dissipated.
Unlike headline inflation, many measures of underlying inflation are not directly observable and must be
estimated. In times of uncertainty, examining a range of measures of underlying inflation is particularly
important, since no single measure is a perfect proxy for medium-term inflation trends. Such an
approach ensures that no individual measure is over-emphasised as being higher or lower in any given
period. The range across different measures of underlying inflation also provides an indication of the
level of uncertainty, as can be seen from the wide range during 2022 and 2023 and its recent narrowing
(Chart 5).
At the same time, the major economic disruptions of recent years also meant that the standard set of
underlying inflation measures became less informative for medium-term inflation developments. In
particular, the bottleneck and energy shocks exerted a significant persistent-but-not-permanent impact
on such measures, such that the standard measures likely over-stated the scale of the increase in the
underlying inflation component.
Accordingly, ECB staff also developed complementary “adjusted” measures of underlying inflation that
filtered out the exceptional influences from supply chain bottlenecks and energy price shocks in the
post-pandemic recovery.1.4 When adjusting for these shocks, the peak of underlying inflation measures
was lower, and the range was narrower, during the high inflation period (Chart 5). With the fading of the


bottleneck and energy shocks, the gap between the adjusted and standard measures of underlying
inflation has declined.

abstract from energy and supply bottleneck shocks using a large SVAR (see Banbura, M., Bobeica, E. and
Martinez Hernandez, C. (2023), “What drives core inflation? The role of supply shocks”, Working Paper
Series, No 2875, ECB), subtracted mechanically from each measure. The latest observations are for September
2024.
Monetary policy transmission
The third element of our reaction function seeks to capture the inherent uncertainty in how monetary
policy is transmitted to financing conditions, the broader economy, and ultimately inflation. The reason
for these uncertainties — explicitly recognised in the 2021 monetary policy strategy statement, which
emphasises the “lags and uncertainty in the transmission of monetary policy to the economy and to
inflation” — lies in the ever-evolving nature of financial intermediation. Together with the scale of the
shocks hitting the economy and the speed and scale of the monetary policy tightening cycle, the state-
contingent responses of banks and other intermediaries influence how strongly policies are transmitted
to the broad economy.
At the start of the tightening cycle, it was not obvious how forcefully increases in the key policy rates
would be transmitted along the yield curve and to broader financing conditions.“ That is why, in
accordance with the data-dependent approach, it was important to carefully check the evolution of bank
funding costs, borrowing costs for households and firms, and credit growth. These statistics (which
arrive only with a lag) were complemented with additional insights from other sources. These include
the bank lending survey (BLS), which captures changes in credit standards and credit demand from


households and businesses, and the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), which
provides firm-level perspectives on credit availability and demand for loans. Taken together, the BLS
and the SAFE provide a useful comparison between the two sides of the market for bank credit: lenders
(vis-a-vis firms and households in the BLS) and corporate borrowers (in the SAFE). Monitoring the
strength of transmission in real time has been important in helping us calibrate and adjust the degree of
restrictiveness necessary to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term target in a timely manner.
Overall, the evidence suggests that the transmission of monetary policy has been forceful and stronger
than the historical pattern.22] The strength of transmission and the disinflationary response probably
reflects the commitment and forcefulness of the monetary policy response to the inflation surge, which
not only steered actual borrowing costs to levels that weighed on demand, but also contributed to
keeping inflation expectations anchored throughout this difficult time.24] In addition, there is some
suggestive evidence that the impact of monetary policy shocks on highly sensitive components of core
inflation appears to be stronger when including the most recent hiking cycle (Chart 6).In addition, the
simultaneous international central bank response to the global surge in inflation amplified the impact of
monetary policy on inflation.241

Beyond the baseline forecast
While the three-pronged reaction function of the Governing Council can be seen as an overarching
strategy towards handling uncertainty about the economy and monetary transmission in the context of
a major inflation shock and a significant monetary policy tightening cycle, staff also employ several
techniques to identify and quantify the risks around the baseline projections. In this section, | will
discuss some of these tools, but this should not be understood as an exhaustive list of the full set of
sensitivity exercises that are run routinely at the ECB to chart out the range of plausible outcomes,
conditional on the current state of information.
Indicators based on past projection errors
A good starting point is to use past forecast errors as a guide to quantifying uncertainty looking into the
future, since projection errors can be interpreted as a catch-all proxy of all of the different sources of
past uncertainty. At the ECB, these forecast errors are used to create fan charts based on ranges, with
the width of such intervals calibrated to be twice the mean absolute value of past errors, excluding
outliers.22! The distribution is assumed to be perfectly symmetric, so no information is provided on the
balance of risks. Uncertainty is illustrated through three different ranges, representing prediction
intervals of 30%, 60% and 90%. These intervals indicate the probability that future observations will fall
within these ranges if the typical shocks from the past, excluding exceptional events, were to occur
again in the future. Knightian uncertainty is, therefore, ruled out by assumption.
A fan chart is a simple way to visualise, interpret and communicate forecast uncertainty based on past
projection errors (Chart 7). It is a useful instrument for conveying complex information both to the
Governing Council and in external communication. However, their construction based on historical data
may lead to an incomplete picture of future uncertainties, especially in the face of atypical, asymmetric
and outsized risks. In addition, fan charts do not explain which risks might affect the economy or the
underlying mechanisms governing how the risks may travel through the economy. This lack of a
narrative can leave policymakers without crucial insights into the underlying drivers of uncertainty about
the inflation and growth outlook.

Notes: The vertical line indicates the start of the current projection horizon. Inflation before this vertical line
indicates data. The horizontal line indicates the 2% inflation target. The ranges shown around the central
projections provide a measure of the degree of uncertainty and are symmetric by construction. The ranges are
based on past projection errors, after adjustment for outliers. The bands, from darkest to lightest, depict the 30%,
60% and 90% probabilities that the outcome of HICP inflation will fall within the respective intervals.
Subjective probability distributions
Another method traditionally employed at the ECB to quantify forecast uncertainty is the application of
subjective probability distributions. In each forecasting round, a survey is conducted among senior staff,
which yields subjective probability distributions around the inflation and growth projections based on
methods to aggregate their individual opinions into a collective judgement 4 These experts also rank
the risks and uncertainties that they consider to be most important, with the results reported to the
Governing Council in a structured manner and discussed in the context of the risk outlook. This
approach is transparent and easy to interpret for the Governing Council. It is also forward-looking and
linked to tangible risks currently on the minds of staff, allowing us to anticipate different environments
that may materialise in the future and understand which risks might be driving the distribution. At the
same time, there is inherent subjectivity in this process, which means that the associated probability
distributions are not entirely derived from empirical data. In addition, while individual risks are ranked,
the specific mechanisms through which those risks could affect the economy remain unclear.
Model-based risk analysis
A model-based approach to quantifying macroeconomic risks is attractive, since it allows us to examine
how current developments steer the entire distribution of future macroeconomic outcomes. This
approach is inspired by a growing body of literature known as ‘macro-at-risk’25] At the ECB, staff have
developed various macro-at-risk models to explore the way specific indicators influence the tail risks
surrounding future real GDP growth and inflation.


One example is given by inflation-at-risk models that help us assess the potential risks to our inflation
projections by estimating the probability distribution of future inflation outcomes at different points in
time. The September projections indicated small downside risks to the 2024 HICP projections, although
over a longer horizon such inflation-at-risk models still identified non-negligible upside risks (Chart 8).

Notes: The chart depicts the predictive distributions of headline HICP inflation for the year 2025 from a combination
of best-performing inflation-at-risk models. The combined density follows the quantile aggregation approach
weighting the individual densities based on their corresponding (inverse of) average continuous ranked probability
score. All distributions are assumed to follow skew-t distributions whose modes are tilted towards the September
2024 baseline projections.
Another example of a macro-at-risk approach generates a path for the tails of the distributions for future
macroeconomic variables by conditioning on monetary and financial developments. The resulting
model-based estimates indicate that both upside and downside risks to growth in the coming years are
consistent with historical patterns (Chart 9, left panel).
It is also possible to extract insights from the joint distribution of inflation and GDP. Recent exercises
have indicated that, by end-2026, the probability of inflation undershooting the target is now greater
than the probability of overshooting. High inflation realisations are more likely to occur in a context of
subpar GDP growth, indicating that adverse supply shocks remain the primary source of upside risk to
inflation (Chart 9, right panel).

Notes: Left and centre panels: for each model, the paths are ranked based on the cumulative output (for GDP) and
average inflation (for inflation) over the next 12 quarters. To get the downside (upside) paths, paths that fall
between the 9th and 11th (89th and 91st) quantile of the relevant distribution are selected and averaged model by
model. The panels present the average paths across the models, and two standard deviations of the path
distribution computed across models as model uncertainty. Historical paths are computed by applying the same
procedure to historical data for GDP and by selecting the relevant percentiles of the distribution for inflation.
Right panel: GDP around potential output is defined as within 0.5 percentage points of potential output. Grey bars
denote the unconditional inflation distribution between the first quarter of 1999 and the fourth quarter of 2023. The
latest observations are for the second quarter of 2024.
Sensitivity analysis related to market-based conditioning assumptions
Conditioning assumptions for the future evolution of key input variables are an important component of
the ECB and Eurosystem staff projections. For example, the paths for inputs such as commodity prices,
including oil and gas prices, are based on market expectations at the time of the projection cut-off date.
Since market expectations are themselves variable (as markets continuously reassess the likely path of
commodity valuations in response to news), staff systematically quantify the sensitivity of our baseline
to changes in these assumptions.
For oil and gas prices, alternative paths are derived using percentiles of option-implied neutral
densities, while staff additionally consider a constant-price assumption. We can illustrate this approach
taking our September projections as the point of departure. At that time, oil prices were close to


symmetrically distributed around the baseline assumption, indicating broadly balanced risks (Chart 10).
However, the gas price distribution highlighted upside risks, probably reflecting adverse geopolitical
developments such as escalating tensions in the Middle East and the incursion of Ukrainian troops into
Russian territory. Staff modelled the effects on our projections of assuming the 25" percentile of these
distributions, the 75" percentile, and constant prices. The findings from the September exercise
indicated an upside skew to inflation risks but limited, balanced risks for GDP growth from the possible
alternative paths for energy prices (Table 1).

Notes: Options-implied densities of gas and oil prices are extracted from 16 August 2024 market quotes of options
on ICE Brent Crude Oil and Dutch TTF Natural gas futures with fixed quarterly expiry dates. The technical
assumption refers to the paths of commodity prices implied by futures markets in the ten working days ending on
the cut-off date, which was 16 August 2024 for the September projections.
These sensitivity analyses are performed on different assumptions for market prices and are easy to
interpret and communicate. These are also forward-looking in that they take account of current market
conditions and expectations, providing a more relevant assessment of future risks stemming from the
variables in focus, than approaches based purely on past projection errors. However, market-based
sensitivity analyses can only quantify risks from a limited subset of factors. And while these offer
statistical insights, these do not condition on the fundamental forces driving a given shift in market
prices.

2024. The constant oil and gas prices take the respective value as at the same date. The macroeconomic effects
are reported as averages of a number of ECB and Eurosystem staff macroeconomic models.
This approach can also be augmented by using model-based density forecasts that do not just consider
individual percentiles of option-implied densities but instead exploit the full distribution. This information
can be incorporated into macroeconomic models using conditional density forecasting techniques. By
imposing the forecasting density of one variable in the model, staff can explore how the densities of
other variables react, with any asymmetric risks being inherited by the model. Chart 11 gives an
example from the September projections exercise./26 Options-implied energy price forecasting
densities imply upside risks to inflation and downside risks to real economic activity, mainly towards the
end of the projection horizon.
Model-based density forecasts can also be valuable in identifying and quantifying specific sources of
projection uncertainty and anticipating future economic conditions, based on current market
expectations. But these forecasts are not easy to communicate. The complexity of the models and the
technical nature of the results can make it challenging to present insights clearly to policymakers.
These forecasts also face model uncertainty and might struggle to capture the dynamics of future


uncertainty, especially if there are structural changes in the economy. Finally, these can still only
consider a limited subset of factors.

Notes: The chart shows model-based densities using a NAWM II version with an enhanced transmission of energy
prices. The dashed blue lines show the 5% and 95% quantiles of the model-based densities centred around the
baseline. The grey densities show the result of a conditional density forecasting exercise in which the forecasting
densities of energy prices (oil and gas) are imposed to be those that come from options (see Montes-Galdo6n, C.,
Paredes, J., and Wolf, E. (2022), “Conditional Density Forecasting: A Tempered Importance Sampling Approach,”
Working Paper Series, No. 2754, ECB). The densities show the 5%, 16%, 84% and 95% quantiles of the
forecasting distributions. The transmission of energy prices in the model is enhanced by assuming a faster pass-
through from energy prices to import prices. Oil and gas prices are drawn jointly to generate densities for the
synthetic energy index with a correlation coefficient q=0.9 using Gaussian copulas.
Scenario analysis
By tracing out the implications of a particular configuration of risks, scenario analysis provides another
approach for communicating that the baseline is surrounded by a wide range of alternative future paths.
Prior to the pandemic, staff conducted occasional scenario analysis, for example to model the
implications of rare and unfamiliar occurrences, such as a no-deal Brexit. From March 2020 onwards,
the ECB used this approach more intensively to navigate the turbulent waters of economic and
geopolitical uncertainty. In each projection round, various scenarios of topical relevance are
considered, with recent exercises covering, inter alia, an escalation of tensions in the Middle East and
alternative scenarios for the evolution of labour productivity.
In some ways, scenario analysis is attractive in terms of interpretation and communication. It is
particularly helpful in providing a narrative that explains how the crystallisation of a particular risk, or a
constellation of inter-linked risks, might affect the economy. Scenario analysis is also naturally forward
looking. It allows us to consider, and to some extent account for, various emerging challenges and
potential future worlds. By focusing on the implications of particular scenarios even when it is very
difficult to attach probabilities to their occurrence, it can also help to confront Knightian uncertainty.


At the same time, especially if not contextualised, an indiscriminate presentation of many scenarios
might excessively shift the focus of attention away from the likeliest outcome towards hypothetical sets
of circumstances that might only have a small probability of being realised. In the other direction,
focusing on a too-small set of scenarios might divert attention from other looming risks.
One specific scenario analysis performed in the context of our September 2024 projections exercise
was to explore the implications of potential shocks to consumer confidence.4 This analysis used a
semi-structural model to assess how unexpected changes in consumer confidence might affect
household decisions on consumption, saving and housing investment. It then examined the broader
implications for economic activity and inflation using a structural model.
Consumer confidence has been volatile since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and it has remained
subdued despite some recent recovery (Chart 12). This scenario analysis explored three possibilities
for the evolution of consumer confidence. A “lower confidence” scenario assumed that consumer
confidence would deteriorate in the fourth quarter of 2024 and remain weak, likely due to increasing
geopolitical uncertainty. When simulated through the model, this resulted in an increase in the saving
ratio for precautionary reasons, also leading to a decline in housing investment. The “higher
confidence” scenario reflected the polar case of improving confidence, likely related to rising real
incomes. Finally, a “temporarily lower confidence” scenario assumed that the initial decline in consumer
confidence would be followed by a rebound in the third quarter of 2025, so that the saving ratio would
initially increase above the baseline but would later converge back to the baseline.

Notes: In the right panel, the data are standardised for the entire available sample — from January 1999 to August
2024 for confidence and from April 2019 to July 2024 for uncertainty. The dashed blue line refers to a projection of
consumer confidence consistent with the baseline projections through the lens of an empirical model. In the right
panel, the vertical line marks the start of the current projection horizon. The latest observations are for the first
quarter of 2024 for the left panel and for August 2024 for the right panel. Scenario 1, “Lower confidence”, is
constructed by imposing responses of housing investment and the saving ratio consistent with a positive one-
standard-deviation shock to consumer confidence, while Scenario 2, “Higher confidence”, imposes the paths
consistent with a negative one-standard-deviation shock. Scenario 3, “Temporarily lower confidence”, imposes the
responses of housing investment and the saving ratio consistent with a negative one-standard-deviation shock
followed by a positive shock of the same magnitude after four quarters.
The results indicated that, in the “lower confidence” scenario, real GDP growth would be 0.3 and 0.6
percentage points below the baseline in 2025 and 2026, respectively (Table 2). This scenario would
also have a negative impact on private consumption and employment growth. In the “temporarily lower
confidence” scenario, real GDP growth would see a cumulative deviation of -0.1 percentage points from
the baseline over 2024-2026, with larger effects on private consumption. By contrast, GDP growth
would be naturally above the baseline in the “higher confidence” scenario. In all scenarios there was


only a very limited impact on the inflation outlook, due to the choice of shocks, which only directly have
an impact on quantities, and a relatively flat Phillips curve in the model used for the scenario analysis.

Calibration of monetary policy
The calibration of monetary policy is the next step the Governing Council needs to take after thoroughly
analysing the risks and uncertainties surrounding the economy, as well as the strength of monetary
transmission. Here, | will focus on a set of model-based policy simulations that are useful in informing
our decision-making in an uncertain environment by exploring the potential outcomes of various policy
actions, mainly over a short horizon. | will also say a few words about how risk management
considerations have informed some of the recent policy decisions of the Governing Council.
Model-based policy simulations
Model-based policy simulations utilise a suite of structural or semi-structural macroeconomic models,
the transmission channels of which represent state-of-the-art knowledge about the workings of the


economy. These models allow us to implement different interest rate paths compared to the baseline
market-based interest rate path that is embedded in the projections. This exercise lends robustness to
our policy choices in the face of economic uncertainty and model uncertainty. As an illustration of this
approach, | will revisit a policy exercise that staff conducted ahead of the June 2024 Governing
Council.
The June projections were predicated on market expectations that entailed a cumulative 75 basis point
cut in the deposit facility rate by the end of 2024. Policy simulations allowed us to assess three possible
profiles that differed in the number of rate cuts by the end of 2024. All profiles assumed a 25 basis point
cut in June 2024, which, by the time the exercise was conducted, was seen as highly likely by the
market. The baseline (“intermediate”) profile implied two further 25 basis point cuts in the third and
fourth quarters, resulting in a deposit facility rate of 3.25% by year-end, broadly in line with the market-
based rate profile at the time. The most restrictive profile (“later”) implemented only a single further 25
basis point rate cut in the fourth quarter of 2024. The most accommodative (“earlier”) profile assumed a
cumulative 50 basis point cut in Q3 2024, followed by another 25 basis point cut in Q4 2024.28] all
three scenarios were extended from the start of 2025 onwards along a trajectory dictated by an
estimated reaction function that mapped the projected macroeconomic conditions into a rate response.
The implications of these alternative policy paths for inflation in 2024, 2025 and 2026, using three
different models and based on the state of knowledge available in June 2024, are shown in Chart 13.
[2°] The most restrictive rate profile was effective in bringing inflation down to levels close to 2% in
2025, though with some dispersion of results across models. However, this rate profile could lead to a
noticeable inflation undershoot in 2026. Conversely, the most accommodative profile was consistent
with somewhat higher inflation in 2025. At a longer horizon, however, this policy trajectory would still
deliver an inflation rate of 1.9%. Intuitively, because of its close alignment with the rate profile
underlying the June projections, the intermediate profile was seen as delivering an outlook for inflation
very close to the projection baseline.

Notes: Circles represent the annual inflation forecasts from the June 2024 projections. Ranges are constructed
from the minimum and maximum of annual inflation rates across the three different models.
Beyond the central tendency of the staff projections and variations in the policy rate around the
benchmark market curve, we also consider the performance of a range of possible interest rates paths
under alternative macroeconomic forecasts. This supports robust policy making in the face of
uncertainty and is particularly important during times of significant economic volatility. | will illustrate this
robustness test in a stylised exercise.
Robust policy
A policy is defined as robust according to the min-max criterion, if it avoids the worst case scenario
across a specified set of macroeconomic environments and policy tactics.2° To illustrate this, let me
describe an exercise in robust control where a structural model is used to simulate three environments:
one based on the model's estimated parameters; the second reflecting a worsening trade-off between
inflation and output due to large supply shocks (“persistent inflation”); and the third increasing the role
of demand shocks and increasing the impact of interest rates on the real economy to capture the
unusual post-pandemic demand pressure and possibly amplified policy transmission. Next, for each
environment staff compute the associated optimal simple rule: the policy rule that maximises the
policymaker’s objectives as defined by a loss function.24] Then each of the optimal policy rules is
deployed in each of the three environments and the losses are computed according to the stipulated
loss function. Finally, policy performance is compared, as measured by these model-based loss
calculations, across the different environments using a min-max strategy. Note that this approach
abstracts from considering whether any particular environment is more or less likely to materialise than
any other.


The first two environments are captured by the four cells in the top left corner of Table 3. A min-max
strategy tries to avoid the outcome with the worst loss, which would be realised by following the
baseline optimal policy (top row) in a “persistent inflation” environment (Second column). Thus, a min-
max approach suggests that, in the face of this particular source of uncertainty, it is advisable to
generally implement a more forceful response to inflation, as indicated by the “persistent inflation”
optimal policy (second row).
However, when considering all three environments (i.e. also including the third row and third column in
Table 3), the largest loss arises when the “persistent inflation” policy (second row) is applied in the
amplification environment (third column) and the baseline reaction is rather to be preferred from a min-
max perspective.231
In summary, even a relatively simple model such as the one used to produce this exercise, can be
helpful to policymakers in that it broadens their view of a whole range of possibilities - some expected,
some undesirable — that may emerge as a result of their choices.
This highlights the value attached to broadening the information base on which the Governing Council
takes decisions and systematically asking “what if’ type of questions in the spirit of robust control to test
our policy responses. In line with this insight, our meeting-by-meeting approach provides flexibility to
respond nimbly to sudden shifts in the environment.

Notes: The persistent inflation environment is modelled via more persistent price mark-up shocks. The persistent
risk premia and amplification effects environment is modelled via more persistent risk premium shocks and an
amplification effect of policy on consumption, investment and more persistent risk premium shocks. Losses refer to
the percentage increase in central bank losses relative to the baseline case. The loss function is given by >((1]e1
) 24+hy y2 ) with Tr, measuring inflation, 1 the inflation target, y the output gap, and the weight Ay=0.2. The rows
contain losses for policy rules that are chosen ex ante. The columns display the environments that materialise ex
post. Each cell therefore displays the loss (in percent deviation from baseline) for a policy rule that was set based
on expectations for the contingency presented in a row, while instead the contingency presented in the column
materialises. The two cells with darker shades indicate the highest losses incurred under the persistent inflation
environment and the amplification environment.
Risk management considerations have influenced some of the recent policy decisions of the Governing
Council. For example, one motivation for the final interest rate hike in September 2023 was taking out
insurance against a scenario in which the process of gradual disinflation that we were already
observing at the time could stall or even reverse. The Governing Council came to the conclusion that it
was Safer to confront such a scenario with interest rates at 4% rather than 3.75%. An additional hike
would reinforce progress towards our target for two basic reasons. First, if the economy evolved
according to the staff baseline case, the decision to hike would bolster confidence that inflation will
return to target within the projection horizon. Second, a higher interest rate would more strongly limit
the amplification of any upside shocks to the inflation path. It followed that, all else equal, a more
secure pace of disinflation and greater insurance against upside risks would also reinforce the


anchoring of inflation expectations, which remained a precondition for the disinflation process to keep
up its pace.
Precautionary risk management considerations also played an important role in motivating our latest
monetary policy decision in October. If the slowdown signalled by recent economic activity indicators
and the below target inflation print in September prove to be temporary, a decision to cut rates in
October could, ex post, turn out as merely having brought forward a December cut. By contrast, if the
recent data signalled a more persistent weakness, which confirms a stronger disinflationary process,
cutting in October would, ex post, signal a nimble adjustment of policy to changing macroeconomic
conditions. Retaining full optionality was therefore important and acted as a hedge against the
materialisation of risks in either direction to the growth and inflation outlook. Communication should
therefore continue to refrain from giving guidance about the speed and scale of monetary easing at
future meetings.
Remaining open-minded about the speed and scale of adjustments is in fact a valuable strategy across
various environments, as different situations may necessitate distinct approaches. Our confidence in a
return of inflation to target has been growing for some time and, in response, we have gradually
reduced our policy rates over the past months. This cautious approach, rooted in the principle of
gradualism, emphasises moving incrementally when faced with uncertainty about the impact of our
actions on the economy - after all, we cannot be certain that monetary transmission will retain its
increased strength documented in the analysis presented earlier in this speech, or return to pre-
pandemic elasticities.241 This careful, step-by-step strategy enables us to observe the responses of the
economy to our decisions and continuously refine our understanding of their impacts.
At the same time, gradualism is not a universal principle, as certain circumstances demand a more
forceful response.2*! In fact, a prominent lesson can be drawn from our rate tightening measures at the
onset of this policy cycle. After an initial phase when the persistence of the inflation surge was unclear
and gradualism was one of our guiding principles, we swiftly moved out of negative territory and
increased our policy rates in quick succession once it became clearer that persistence was indeed
high, risking an upside de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Forceful rate actions (a pair of 75 basis
point hikes in September and October 2022, followed by a triple of 50 basis points hikes between
December 2022 and March 2023) were the appropriate response to avoid the risk that inflation
expectations might de-anchor and, by dampening demand, to limit the scale and duration of second-
round adjustments to the initial inflation shocks. Model-based estimates suggest that our decisive policy
response reduced inflation rates by approximately two percentage points on average in each year
between 2023 and 2026. Crucially, our rate decisions during this time helped to keep de-anchoring
risks under control.8&
Taken together, we are best served by making decisions in a state-dependent manner, taking into
account the specific circumstances at hand. This flexible, meeting-by-meeting approach ensures that
we remain responsive to the ever-changing economic landscape, enhancing our ability to effectively
achieve our policy objectives.
Communication


To steer the economy through the current challenging times, a central bank needs to manage
expectations — not only about inflation, but also about risks and uncertainties that can have major
effects on our economy. By clearly conveying our economic outlook, risk assessment and policy
decisions, we can help to reduce uncertainty and stabilise inflation expectations.
In this respect, as stressed in our 2021 Monetary Policy Strategy Statement, effective communication is
a priority for us. In order to ensure that the message reaches its recipients and is well understood, we
have been adjusting our language and expanding our communication channels. The monetary policy
statement, published after each monetary policy meeting, is the principal channel through which the
collective voice of the Governing Council reaches specialised economic observers and the public at
large. The text needs to be made accessible to both constituencies. Indeed, the complexity of the
statement, as measured by standard text analysis metrics, has decreased substantially (Chart 14). To
further improve the understanding of our communication among non-technical audiences, we follow a
layered approach, whereby the monetary policy statement is complemented by visual summaries laying
out the essentials of our assessment about the economy and our policy choices.

Notes: The chart depicts the length and the complexity of the ECB’s monetary policy statements (known as the
“introductory statement” until June 2021). The length is measured by the number of words (indicated by circle
size). The difficulty of the language employed is measured using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score, which
indicates how many years of formal training are required to understand the text, based on the length of its
sentences and words. Coenen et al. refers to Coenen, G., Ehrmann, M., Gaballo, G., Hoffmann, P., Nakov, A.,
Nardelli, S., Persson, E., and Strasser, G. (2017), “Communication of Monetary Policy in Unconventional
Times,” Working Paper Series, No. 2080, ECB.
An important part of the monetary policy statement is the risk assessment section. This systematically
highlights the Governing Council's collective view on potential upside and downside risks to economic
growth and inflation, drawing on the various factors analysed by staff using the methods and
approaches discussed in this speech. As such, this section highlights particular uncertainties that the
Governing Council identifies as surrounding the future outlook and provides some sense of how policy


might need to be altered should different risks crystallise. Being transparent about alternative sets of
circumstances that may push the economy onto trajectories that are different and possibly far from
baseline does not mean necessarily being precise about the balance of those forces oftentimes pulling
key macroeconomic variables in opposite directions.
Stressing state dependency and optionality, in line with the meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent
approach, can help to avoid embracing a view or a policy approach, which could reduce our room for
manoeuvre in conditions that we were unable to anticipate.!=4 This ability to react flexibly is likely to be
particularly useful when economic outcomes are dynamic and there is high uncertainty surrounding the
outlook for inflation.
Conclusion
As | have laid out today, our monetary policy decisions are supported by a broad range of staff
analyses on risks and contingencies, as well as through comprehensive simulations of monetary policy
and stance scenarios. By effectively communicating our policy decisions and risk assessment, we
enhance transparency and maintain public trust in our policy actions. And it is essential that we are
agile in responding to risks that might crystallise and new uncertainties that might emerge.
Our approach is not static. We are committed to the continuous development of our analytical toolkit,
including by incorporating the latest research and advances from other policy institutions. Our 2025
assessment of our monetary policy strategy will provide an opportunity to reassess our current methods
and explore new techniques and innovations. This will help us identify gaps or areas for improvement,
ensuring that our toolkit remains comprehensive and state-of-the-art, allowing us to confront whatever
forms of uncertainty we face in the coming years.
Finally, | want to conclude by differentiating between uncertainty about the macroeconomic cycle
versus uncertainty about the economic trend. While | have been primarily focused on cyclical factors
today, uncertainty about the trend also matters for monetary policy. In particular, the euro area
economy could better withstand cyclical shocks if there were an improvement in the trend growth rate.
To this end, the recommendations in the Letta and Draghi reports are of first order importance for the
central bank, including a more ambitious agenda for capital markets union.)

design of forward guidance or the calibration of unconventional monetary policy instruments such as
quantitative easing or targeted longer-term refinancing operations. Especially since the Governing

the pros and cons of communicating individual-level judgements as a way to capture “cross-sectional”
uncertainty within the group of policymakers.

This survey is not published, in order to allow staff to provide a frank risk assessment, without having to
worry about the implications for public communication. In March and September, the survey
participants are senior staff at the ECB; in June and December, the survey participants are the
members of the Eurosystem’s Monetary Policy Committee.

Such model simulations are run in quarterly models and therefore cannot clearly distinguish the timing
of policy decisions across the two meetings within a quarter.

This exercise, in the spirit of Levin and Williams, is explained in more detail in a chapter of the
forthcoming Handbook on Inflation (by Coenen, G. et al.). For more detail on Levin and Williams’
approach, see Levin, A.T. and Williams, J.C. (2003), “Robust monetary policy with competing reference
models”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 50, No 5, pp. 945-975.
31.
The structural model we use is the MMR model (Mazelis, F., Motto, R. and Ristiniemi, A. (2023),
Series, No. 2797, ECB) that is also typically used in policy simulations like the preceding exercise.
32.
A loss function is conventionally defined as a squared sum of weighted averages between deviations of
inflation from target and the output gap, with weights of 1 and 0.2, respectively. The weights are
estimated based on euro area data, assuming that monetary policy followed a loss function-based
approach in the past. In our example, the environment with stronger inflation persistence calls for a
more forceful response to inflation. The third environment takes more account of economic slack in the
reaction function.


33.
Table 3 examines a loss function that puts some weight on stabilising output as well as stabilising
inflation. The results naturally differ if no weight is put on output stabilisation.

The classic reference to the attenuation principle is Brainard (1967), see Brainard, W. (1967),
“Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy”, American Economic Review, Vol. 57, No. 2, pp. 411-425.
Similar advice follows from a policymaker’s desire to avoid aggregate macroeconomic volatility or
enhance financial sector stability, see Woodford, M. (2003), “Optimal interest-rate smoothing”, Review
of Economic Studies, 70(4), 861-886and Cukierman, A. (1991), “Why does the Fed smooth interest
rates?”, in Belongia, M.T. (Ed.), Monetary Policy on the 75th Anniversary of the Federal Reserve
System, Springer, respectively.
35.
The attenuation principle is not necessarily robust to model uncertainty: see Giannoni, M. (2002), “Does
Model Uncertainty Justify Caution? Robust Optimal Monetary Policy in a Forward-Looking Model’,
Macroeconomic Dynamics, Vol. 6, No. 1, pp. 111-144 or Sdéderstrém, U. (2002), “Monetary Policy with
Uncertain Parameters”, Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol. 104, No. 1, pp. 125-145 or if the
policymaker is susceptible to a cautiousness bias, see Dupraz, S., Guilloux-Nefussi, S., and Penalver,
A. (2023), “A Pitfall of Cautiousness in Monetary Policy’, International Journal of Central Banking, Vol.
19, No. 3, pp. 269-323, August.
