Members of the Riigikogu.
Thank you for the opportunity to present a review of the activities of Eesti Pank in 2024.
I will also speak about the main events in the economy and the financial sector, and 
about the difficulties that have been caused as the world has become more uncertain.
I would like first to state that in 2024 Eesti Pank carried out all of its core tasks, which 
cover maintaining price stability and implementing monetary policy in the euro area, 
managing the currency reserves of the state, ensuring the circulation of cash and 
operation of payment systems, and securing financial stability in Estonia. Eesti Pank 
also produces economic and financial statistics and economic analysis, works 
internationally with partners, and advises the government on matters of monetary and 
economic policy.
Topics of particular note last year were
inflation falling in the euro area, which allowed the European Central Bank to start 
cutting interest rates after having had to raise them rapidly
signs of recovery starting to appear in the Estonian economy
security deteriorating in Europe, which required services that are vital for society 
to be made more resilient to any crisis. For the central bank this primarily means 
that we must invest more in securing our activities against any crisis and ensuring 
that payment services and the circulation of cash are fully resilient.
I will begin with the topic that is most important for the central bank, which is 
maintaining price stability. We at the Governing Council of the European Central Bank 
became sufficiently confident last June that the rate of inflation in the euro area had 
come down enough and was on track to reach the target of 2%. This meant we could 
start cutting central bank interest rates gradually. We had had to raise them sharply in 
the preceding couple of years, after which they had remained at record high levels for 
nine months. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, leaving borrowers more 
money at hand and making investment more affordable for businesses. We have now 
cut interest rates in the euro area eight times, and the main interest rate at the central 
bank has now come down by half from its peak of 4%. The key interest rate for 
borrowers in Estonia is the six-month Euribor, which follows the movements in the 
European Central Bank's interest rates. It peaked at above 4% but has now come down 
to close to 2%, falling by almost half, as the central bank rates have gradually been cut.

We also continued to bring the balance sheet of the European Central Bank back to its 
normal level, after it had expanded because of the crisis measures taken in earlier 
years. Those measures have been taken to support economic activity in the euro area 
during the years of crisis. All of the asset purchase programmes of the central bank 
have now been terminated and purchases are no longer being made, and the 
reinvestment of maturing bonds was also ended last year. The balance sheet of the 
European Central Bank was shrunk by almost half a trillion euros last year.
The general economic environment continued to be affected last year by the war 
Russia started in Ukraine, which has deepened geopolitical instability and pushed up 
prices of energy and commodities. The new wave of uncertainty was caused by the 
sharp change in US trade policy after the US presidential elections, as additional tariff 
barriers started to appear in trade between countries.
Statistics Estonia revised its recent figures for growth in the Estonian economy and now 
found that instead of GDP growing constantly throughout all of last year, there was 
actually a decline in it. I should state though that a much larger set of statistical 
indicators need to be considered if reliable conclusions are to be drawn about the 
economy and the most objective possible assessment made. Those statistical 
indicators include many that point to the economy recovering, as retail sales, industrial 
output, exports and several other key indicators were all rising last year for example. 
The economy is recovering, but it is doing so quite slowly. The purchasing power of the 
average wage, which is the gross wage adjusted for inflation, has risen, but by the end 
of last year it had reached the same level that it was at in May 2021 before the energy 
crisis and the sharp rise in cost of living.
Inflation staying high and its impact on the purchasing power of people in the country 
remains a concern. The cost of living rose last year by around 3.5%, but inflation in 
Estonia this year is expected to be 5-6%, of which about a third will come from tax rises. 
The remainder will mainly come from growth in wages and from prices for food rising 
because commodities prices have risen on global markets. Real incomes will not 
increase this year, because the rise in the average wage will only just exceed inflation 
in the consumer basket, while the income tax rate rose at the start of this year. They 
may be expected to do so from next year, when the tax-free threshold is extended to all 
taxpayers and as inflation falls.
It is good to see that the labour market in the euro area and in Estonia has resisted very 
well, even when the economy was facing challenging times. Unemployment has risen in 
Estonia, but by less than would be considered normal during such a recession. 
Companies have preferred to keep their employees on the payroll in the expectation of 
better times ahead, and to avoid redundancies because finding new staff may prove 
more expensive and difficult as there is a shortage of skilled labour in Estonia. 
Companies have instead sacrificed part of their expected profits, and so labour costs hit 
a record level last year as a share of corporate profit.
That people in Estonia have kept their jobs and their incomes have increased in euros 
has helped them cope with their financial obligations. They have managed this despite 
the weakness in the economy and interest rates being much higher than they had been 
in earlier years. The resilience of companies was aided by the buffers that they built up 

3/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
in the years before the recession, and so although the share of problem loans at the 
banks has increased a little, it still remains small.
We at Eesti Pank consider that the measures taken so far to ensure stability in the 
financial sector are appropriate in the current environment. The risks however have 
increased. The growth in the amount lent to households and companies by the 
domestic financial sector and from abroad at the end of 2024 exceeded long-term 
nominal GDP growth, and it accelerated even further in 2025. We consequently 
consider it reasonable to maintain the countercyclical capital buffer rate at 1.5% to 
reduce the risks to the banking sector from rapid growth in lending. Yearly growth in 
lending in Estonia has been among the fastest in the euro area at almost 10%, while 
the average in the euro area has been below 3%. We must be aware that geopolitical 
tensions causing a new recession in the economy could increase the amount of 
problem loans. In that case it would become necessary to maintain the current larger 
capital buffers of the banks, even though their own funds are sufficient to cover worse 
loan losses than expected.
Geopolitical tensions could also hinder banks that are trying to access capital from 
international money and capital markets, and so restrict the loan supply. A large part of 
the liabilities of the banking sector are local deposits, but other sources of funding have 
notably increased as a share of the financing of the banks in recent years. Proximity to 
an aggressive Russia has probably increased the risk level of Estonia and its 
neighbourhood in the eyes of foreign investors, and international financial markets have 
been volatile, but the Estonian banks have been successful in their bond issues.
An important topic that has arisen across Europe and in Estonia is the need to assess 
whether various regulations are holding enterprise back, including enterprise in the 
financial sector. I am personally part of a high-level working group handling this at the 
European Central Bank, but we are also assessing proposals made by the Estonian 
banks and other financial companies that would for example make reporting simpler.
The third main topic I mentioned earlier was security in a crisis, which we are working 
on throughout the whole of the Eesti Pank organisation.
Crisis readiness affects the operations of the central bank itself, and also its role in the 
operation of the two vital services of cash circulation and payment services. During the 
large-scale electricity blackout in Spain and Portugal in the spring, food and other 
essentials could only be bought for cash. This was a clear reminder for all of us of how 
important it is to hold some funds as physical cash. Digital payments are convenient, 
but we must be ready and able to cope if they stop working. We ran several business 
continuity exercises during the year at Eesti Pank, and organised exercises with other 
institutions, banks and other businesses to practice cooperation and sharing 
responsibility in the event of a crisis. We helped providers of vital cash circulation 
services compile their risk analyses and continuity plans. We run the crisis exercise and 
resilience tests every year so that Estonia would be as ready as possible to deal with 
any disruption to the circulation of cash or any interruption to payments. We ran a larger 
crisis exercise in the spring together with the banks and we focused closely on working 
together with local governments.

4/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
We updated last year the resilience requirements for payment systems for the banks 
providing vital services, which are currently Swedbank, SEB, Luminor, LHV and Coop 
Pank, to be certain that payments would continue to function in even harsher 
circumstances if even greater dangers were to be realised. We are working with the 
commercial banks to develop backup solutions, including offline card payments that are 
intended principally for use in shops, petrol stations and chemists that provide vital 
services in a crisis. These would allow vitally important purchases to be made even if 
the information systems of the banks are not functioning, there is no communication 
connection, or the card schemes are down.
We took the initiative to launch discussions on how to find backup solutions that could 
ensure resilience of operation at the European Union level as well. An example of this is 
the ongoing preparations of the European Central Bank to bring the euro into circulation 
in a digital form. One feature of the digital euro is that it would equally allow digital 
payments to be made when there is no internet connection, and this would make 
European payment systems more autonomous and more resilient to any crisis in future. 
The digital euro project is currently in its preparatory phase and the legal basis that is 
needed for it is under discussion in the European Parliament and at the Council. I would 
invite anybody who is interested in this topic to attend the international conference on 
the digital euro being organised at the end of September by Eesti Pank together with 
the Latvian and Lithuanian central banks.
We also ran exercises for how to cope with a financial crisis. It is unlikely that any such 
crisis would occur in Estonia, but if it did, then it would have a widespread impact 
across the financial system. This is why the Nordic and Baltic states worked together 
last year to hold a third crisis exercise that also involved supervision and resolution 
authorities at the European Union level. It is important when running such exercises to 
map the potential weak points and ways that they could be remedied.
I may now also say a few words about Eesti Pank's constitutional role as an economic 
policy adviser to the government. We have regular meetings with members of the 
government, the President of the Republic and the parties in the Riigikogu, and I would 
like to highlight how experts from Eesti Pank contributed to the expert group on 
competitiveness set up in 2023 by the Economic Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu. 
The result of this work was the first report on competitiveness, which was released last 
year, and the conclusions of which were discussed in the Riigikogu as a question of 
national importance. We held a high-level public seminar at Eesti Pank with 
international experts that concentrated on increasing productivity in the economy and 
the role of the state in achieving this. The second report by the expert group was 
presented to the Riigikogu in June this year, and on 24 September an international 
seminar based on report will be held. We believe it is important that this work continue 
in the years ahead.
Our message on the state finances has always been that orderly state finances are the 
cornerstone of growth in economy. Orderly state finances means more than having a 
fiscal deficit that is lower than planned for one-off or temporary reasons, as happened 
last year and is highly likely to happen again this year. There should be a long-term 
plan for the needs and possibilities of the state that is based on sustainable fiscal rules 
and that gives confidence to local businesses and foreign investors. The exemption 

5/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
clause from the European fiscal rules allows countries, including Estonia, to run a fiscal 
deficit of up to 4.5% of GDP if it is used to strengthen national defence. There are two 
restrictions on this though, as the deficit may only be increased temporarily and the 
increase must be specifically targeted. The temptation to make the maximum use of the 
additional fiscal space, including by spending it for other purposes, could threaten the 
sustainability of the state finances in the longer term. Permanently higher spending by 
the state requires there to be a larger revenue base.
Eesti Pank analysed competition between the banks in the Estonian lending market at 
the start of 2024, and found that concentration is higher and competition generally 
weaker in Estonia's small market than in most other European countries. Together with 
Finantsinspektsioon we made several proposals for ways to make it simpler and 
cheaper to transfer a housing loan from one bank to another. We proposed removing 
the requirement to have the transaction notarised when a mortgage is moved from one 
bank to another and the conditions of the contract do not change, and we proposed that 
the requirement to have a property revalued every time a loan is refinanced could be 
lifted. Clients would also gain if banks were no longer able to charge three months of 
interest when the client wants to terminate their loan contract early. The legislative 
changes were not made in 2024, but the government has by now started working on 
several of those proposals. I may add that competition has improved in the housing 
loan market in recent years, and the margins on housing loans have narrowed. This 
does not mean though that our proposals are no longer relevant.
Eesti Pank worked with the Ministry of Finance to produce a draft act for the rounding 
rule for small coins, which was passed by the Riigikogu last year and came into force at 
the start of this. We have seen that the change happened smoothly, with the heavy 
lifting done by merchants in Estonia, who worked hard to ensure the rounding rule was 
applied successfully at checkouts in shops. I would like to thank the Estonian Traders 
Association for their excellent and proactive cooperation in this. The changes meant 
that Eesti Pank no longer needs to produce tonnes of one and two-cent coins that are 
not used for payment and place a heavy burden on the environment. We have also 
continued to work with Omniva to allow people to exchange their coins for larger 
banknotes. This has all improved the recirculation of coins substantially, as last year we 
issued 30% fewer circulating coins than in the previous year, while 64% more coins 
were returned to us from circulation. So many one and two-cent coins were returned to 
us that we were able to trade them with the Latvian central bank at the start of this year 
as we exchanged our one and two-cent coins for two-euro coins from them. This was 
an excellent example of successful cooperation between multiple partners.
From our statistical work I would like to highlight the closer cooperation with Statistics 
Estonia to service the forecasting and economic analysis models of Eesti Pank. 
Analysts at Eesti Pank can now access several pseudonymised microdata registers and 
databases, which should help them to understand better what is happening in the 
economy. It should also make our analysis and political advice even more accurate. We 
use the microdata in analysing the labour market, in economic research, and in 
studying the productivity and competitiveness of businesses.
Developing new methods of analysis will help us understand better how climate change 
affects inflation and economic growth. We worked with the European Central Bank and 
other central banks in Europe to assess how climate risks and the goals of the green 

6/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
transition will affect the financial sector, and last year we analysed the carbon intensity 
of the corporate loans portfolios of the banks. We also monitor climate targets in the 
Eesti Pank investment portfolio, and as an organisation we are trying to reduce the 
carbon footprint of our activities.
An important part of our international cooperation is representing Estonia at the 
International Monetary Fund. The increase in the IMF quota has been a current topic for 
several years, and it is needed so that the IMF can maintain its capacity to lend. The 
Riigikogu has approved the increase in the Estonian quota, but the national legislative 
processes have not yet been completed in several member states, and so last year 
Eesti Pank extended its bilateral loan contract with the IMF to 2027.
The profits of Eesti Pank recovered last year, and that has allowed us to resume the 
practice of transferring a quarter of the central bank's profit from the previous year to 
the state budget. We continue to look to organise the work of the central bank as 
efficiently and effectively as possible, and as part of this we share support services with 
Finantsinspektsioon, which is housed in the same buildings as us, and we monitor 
carefully that our activities do not overlap. We finally succeeded this year in selling 
Maardu Manor, which is not needed for the core activities of the central bank but took 
several years to sell. The bank made a profit of 74 million euros last year. The 
Supervisory Board of Eesti Pank decided to transfer a quarter of this, or 18.5 million 
euros, to the state budget. Since 1992 Eesti Pank has allocated a total of 192 million 
euros from its profit to the state budget.
We also continued to build up the Eesti Pank capital buffers so they would be sufficient 
for the central bank to carry out its core activities. Our long-term plan is to reach the 
average level of the central banks in the euro area, and at the end of 2024 this meant 
we needed to raise the capital buffers several times from their level of 715 million euros.
A few words now on what lies ahead for the economy. Unfortunately we should not 
hope that the economy will recover at the same speed that it did after earlier 
recessions. This is partly because we have become wealthier as a nation and raising 
our level even further is a stiffer challenge for growth than it was in earlier years. 
Interest rates have come down a long way, which benefits people and companies, but 
there remains a lot of uncertainty about the future. This encourages saving, and putting 
money to one side rather than spending or investing it. Neither is it clear what form 
global trade relations will take, though the rules on trade between the European Union 
and the USA are a little better defined than they were in the summer.
Eesti Pank held a public seminar on trade barriers in the spring, at which businesses 
and experts spoke. The general opinion was that there will be no return to the past and 
that it is necessary to adapt to the new circumstances. This gives even greater priority 
to resolving the pinch points in competitiveness in Estonia, and to the ability to be part 
of the changed value chains. It is important to work with the business environment that 
we have and to eliminate the bottlenecks that choke the development and growth of 
companies. Efforts at the level of the European Union are also important, and we 
should make better use than we have so far of our potential in the large single market, 
and we should develop the single capital market so that we can fund the needs of 
Europe for development and defence.

Eesti Pank is keen to offer its advice and its efforts for these topics, though our core 
task remains maintaining price stability.
Thank you for your attention and I am ready to answer any questions you may have.
