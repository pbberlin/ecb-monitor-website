1 Introduction
Ladiesandgentlemen, dear colleagues,
It is a pleasure and an honour to welcome you today to the conference on "Artificial 
Intelligence and the Future of Central Banking", jointly hosted by SUERF –The 
European Money and Finance Forum–and the Deutsche Bundesbank.
I am pleased to see so many people here in the room with us in Frankfurt today. And it 
is wonderful that there are so many participants joining us virtually, too. This conference 
gives us the chance to discuss the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) for central 
banking and the wider economy. I would therefore especially like to thank the 
organisers of this conference, the speakers, and the participants in the policy panel. 
Thank you for making this gathering possible and for drawing up such an exciting 
agenda. 
The subject of today's conference is both topical and important. We are all aware that 
we are living and working in a period of change. We as central bankers are committed 
to fulfilling our mandate and performing our tasks in this challenging environment. 
Artificial intelligence offers us great opportunities, but it poses challenges, too. I 
therefore welcome today's event with open arms, as it will allow us to exchange ideas 
and perspectives on both.
At the Bundesbank, we develop and use different AI applications that support 
employees in a wide range of tasks. For example, we have released a platform 
enabling staff throughout our institution to configure text-based intelligent assistants 
TIAs(which we call TIAs) for their daily work. These  can even be used to process 
confidential data. A second Bundesbank platform uses natural language processing 
(NLP), allowing large volumes of documents to be pre-processed and analysed.
Yet another example is MILA the Monetary-Intelligent Language Agent model, which we 
set up to analyse central bank communication with the help of generative AI.1 When 
given my remarks to analyse, this model concluded that the brief speech I am giving 
today exhibits something you will surely also notice for yourselves: optimism about how 
we can use the transformative potential of AI. I have both optimism and confidence: 
confidence that we will also master the challenges posed by the transformative power

AIof   for central banks and the economy in general. I would therefore like to use the 
AInext few minutes to shed light on both the opportunities afforded by  and the 
challenges it presents.
2 The transformative potential of AI 
The transformative potential of AI arises from different dimensions and promises of this 
technology. We expect artificial intelligence to improve our business processes. It also 
represents an extension of our analytical toolkit. I would now like to focus on two of the 
aspects we will be taking a closer look at in today's conference.
The first of these is the use of AI AI for enhanced forecasting and structural analysis: 
 offers tools to process vast datasets. These can help, amongst other things, to detect 
previously unseen patterns. But they can also improve predictive accuracy. For 
example, machine learning may help to anticipate inflationary pressures, shifts in labour 
markets, or structural breaks in the economy more swiftly than traditional models allow.
Applications based on machine learning at the Bundesbank are, inter alia, used to 
model inflation, interest rates and fiscal expenditures as well as loan and trade 
volumes. Our experience shows that machine learning approaches are not always 
superior to traditional ones. Hence, I would like to emphasise that AI complements the 
work of our employees as an additional tool. It does not replace expert knowledge.
The second aspect I would like to mention is the following: AI is not only a means to 
better understand the macroeconomy. It is itself becoming a driver of macroeconomic 
dynamics. It can, amongst other things, affect productivity, labour markets, and capital 
formation. For example, it will impact on the diffusion of innovation and may thus affect 
potential growth.
The Bundesbank Survey of firms (BOP-F) for the second quarter of 2025 reflected the 
impact of generative AI on the world of work.2 A majority of firms that already employ 
AIgenerative  expected that its use would improve their profitability, customer 
satisfaction and employee satisfaction. For the year 2024, around one-half of the firms 
AI AIthat had already employed  by that time reported that the use of generative 
 increased their productivity. 
However, expert opinions on the magnitudeof AI's impact on productivity vary greatly.  
Understanding such forces and dynamics is crucial for central banks, as they assess 
the medium-term economic outlook, structural change, and the transmission of 
monetary policy.
3 Challenges ofAI from a central banking perspective   
Colleagues at the Bank for International Settlements have been looking more closely at 
the use of AI applications in central banking.3 Their findings show that central banks 
AIhave been early adopters of  and machine learning techniques for important tasks.4
AI At the same time, the great potential of  poses several challenges for central banks. 
Let me explain this again using the two aspects I focused on before. 

3/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
First, it is of crucial importance that models are reliable and that they can be interpreted 
properly. Advanced AI methods are sometimes regarded as "black boxes". This is 
because it can be more difficult to fully understand how they achieve their output 
compared to traditional approaches. However, for central banks, transparency and 
credibility are key. Both are crucial in terms of how central banks work and how they 
communicate with markets and the public. It is therefore important to invest in 
AIexplainable  methods–some of which we will see in today's presentations.
The second issue concerns the challenges presented by the economic implications of 
AI. The transformative power of AI might foster structural changes. Thus, monitoring the 
AIimpact of  in its multiple dimensions and from different perspectives is crucial. This is 
AIchallenging because  is progressing swiftly, and its macroeconomic impact might 
change rapidly. 
At the current juncture, we are seeing many firms in the euro area still using AI on a 
AIlimited or experimental basis.5 Moreover, in many occupations,  is currently mainly 
supporting employees in various tasks, rather than fully taking over their jobs. However, 
AIas we have seen, the capabilities of  are expanding quickly. And so are its potential 
implications for labour markets and monetary policy transmission. 
We must proceed with caution and take care to continually update our evaluation of the 
impact of AI. To do so, we require, inter alia, information on the use of AI that is 
representative and comparable across countries. Such data are scarce, however. In 
view of this, the Bundesbank, Banca d'Italia and Banco d'España are working together 
AIon harmonising questions on  in their representative firm surveys.
To sum up, I hope I have given you some insight into how we at the Bundesbank are 
open to new technologies, how we try to leverage their potential and how we discuss 
their advantages and disadvantages. 
4 What this conference aims to achieve
Today gives us the opportunity to share advanced research and central banking 
practices with regard to AI, machine learning, non-traditional data and macroeconomic 
dynamics. There will be room for thoughtful dialogue on how the work of central banks 
needs to evolve in light of the advent of AI. And there will be room for building networks. 
Over the next few hours, you will probably challenge assumptions, perhaps confront 
blind spots and–as I very much hope–lay the basis for future collaboration.
5 Conclusion
Let me close with a few personal reflections. Being open to innovation is not just about 
technology–it's also about mindset and the exchange of information and ideas. I am 
proud to be part of a central bank community that embraces both innovation and an 
open exchange about how to apply it best. This conference provides a forum for all of 
the above, so let's take full advantage of the opportunity!

While we discuss AI's technical and economic dimensions, though, let us not forget the 
broader societal dimension: technology should ultimately serve people. The same holds 
for us as central banks: We should use AI to serve the public interest by fulfilling our 
mandate. This goal and our commitment to it remain as important as ever. 
Thank you very much for your attention.
