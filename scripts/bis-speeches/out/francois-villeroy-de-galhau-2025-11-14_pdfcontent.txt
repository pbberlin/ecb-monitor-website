1/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
François Villeroy de Galhau: Speech - Tracfin Forum
Speech by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France and Chair 
at the 3rd Tracfin of the Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR), 
Forum, Paris, 7 November 2025.
* * *
I am delighted to open this third forum – which coincides with Tracfin's 35th anniversary 
– and to do it here at Bercy, a place dear to both Antoine Magnant, who I am really 
happy to see here, and to myself, both of us former members of the French Tax 
Authority. This invitation is also a mark of recognition for the women and men of the 
ACPR and the Banque de France, two institutions committed to AML/CFT: the former 
as the supervisory authority for financial institutions, the latter as a central bank 
"subject" to the Monetary and Financial Code. 
I do admit that I forbid the use of "subject to" at the ACPR, and we prefer 'supervised'. 
"Subject to" does not reflect what we really are: responsible partners, committed to a 
joint battle against one of the greatest scourges of our time. A total of 230,000 reporting i
entities – 400 of which are gathered here today – form our first line of defence. In this 
war of movement that we are waging against increasingly inventive criminals, the 
cooperation between Tracfin and the ACPR takes on its full meaning. Allow me, 
therefore, to present an overview and then to set out two priorities. 
I.  Overview of cooperation between Tracfin and ACPR
Over 35 years, Tracfin has forged a and, above all, a unique place in our  reputation 
institutional landscape: growing from a handful of employees at its foundation to 230 
today, and from 40,000 suspicious transaction reports in 2015 to more than 215,000 at 
the end of 2024 – although numbers don't tell the whole story, but I will return to this 
point. Tracfin's teams are able to turn these reports into proper financial intelligence: in 
2024, nearly EUR 3 billion worth of suspicious flows were detected in relation to tax 
fraud – on VAT, CPF (personal training accounts) or energy renovation – and more 
than EUR 800 million in employment fraud linked to undeclared employment. 
Most of the suspicious flows detected come from suspicious transaction reports 
submitted by financial institutions. This commitment from the financial sector is also 
partly the result of close cooperation with the ACPR, which has recently had a number 
of concrete achievements: the revision of joint guidelines, the creation of a standardised 
bank statement, and a major training programme on crypto-assets, funded by the 
European Commission and partly hosted by the ACPR almost exactly one year ago. 
Beyond these specific examples, Tracfin and the ACPR are united by long-standing 
cooperation. Both in terms of specific individuals and liaison officers, as well as our 
colleagues from Tracfin who have joined the ACPR (and vice versa). And by key 
moments: every year, Tracfin's memoranda enrich our control programme. On-site 
inspections are then prepared with Tracfin and covered in a shared report.

II. Two fronts in the same battle: efficiency, anticipation and 
cooperation
I now come on to our two common priorities: first and foremost, strengthening 
operational efficiency, and then anticipating changing threats and cooperating to thwart 
them. 
Efficiency
Staying ahead in the fight against crime first means detecting how it changes over time, 
and focusing our efforts on what truly matters. With nearly 197,000 suspicious 
transaction reports (STRs) filed by the financial sector in 2024, we have achieved an 
unprecedented level of commitment. And the first quarter of 2025 would appear to have 
witnessed a further increase of 22.5%. However, such a volume of information also ii
carries a , especially whenrisk of dispersion   the quality of the flow of information is 
. Too many superficial, insufficiently substantiated suspicious transaction not perfect
reports – sometimes without any real suspicion – saturate the system. I welcome the 
start of our joint work between the ACPR and Tracfin to establish a shared diagnosis of 
the of reporting flows. I also call for more quality   support for reporting entities, in 
. Tracfin is already doing particular by publishing highly operational quality criteria
a great deal. I am thinking here of the feedback that showcases the top STRs 
and "highlights" the "flops", the organisation of sectoral workshops and the appointment 
of correspondents for each sector. This progress is useful, but we need more structural 
changes. Several of our neighbours – Germany, Italy and Switzerland – can show us 
the way here. Italy has deployed tracking indicators. Switzerland publishes 'negative 
typologies', i.e. cases that are not worth reporting. Germany's guide to best practices 
would also be useful. We need to recognise that it is sometimes difficult to deploy 
processes that can be adapted to the various obligations, in particular those relating to 
the right to a bank account procedure, KYC and STRs. The German example is 
particularly instructive: thanks to the joint efforts of the German equivalent of Tracfin 
and the supervisor, BaFin, the volume of reports fell by nearly 20% between 2023 and 
2024, facilitating a shift in focus to cases of greater interest.
This is not about sweeping problems under the carpet, but rather about getting back to 
what is most important: if we are truly effective in preventing criminals from using 
the financial system, we should eventually see fewer suspicious transactions in 
. Letting any transaction go through and just sending Tracfin a this domain
standardised report on funds that have already vanished would simply play into the 
hands of criminals. The study published by the ACPR last July on "pass-through 
accounts" shows that institutions that engage in such practices are at least 100 times 
more likely to be used by criminals. Our message is clear:these practices are  
. An STR only removes civil, criminal and disciplinary liability if it is made unacceptable
in good faith and under the conditions provided for by law.
The ACPR and Tracfin will use all the tools at their disposal to enforce the law. For 
example, Tracfin should be able – legally – to make broader use of the inadmissibility 
of STRs by incorporating the criterion of quality:  aside from purely technical or linguistic 
cases, an unusable report should be rejected. Such feedback would send a clear signal 

3/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
to financial institutions. Tracfin's objective feedback will in turn help to guide the 
investigations the ACPR, which does not have access to STRs on an ongoing basis. I 
am convinced that the quality of a suspicious transaction report says a lot about 
.the robustness of the system that produces it
On the operational efficiency front, we must all make the most of the revolution in 
artificial intelligence and data. At the ACPR, for example, we have developed our own 
AI tool, LUCIA, to enhance the effectiveness of our on-site inspections.  For reporting 
entities dealing with large volumes of transactions, AI can also be an opportunity. This 
requires investing in enhanced monitoring tools and, undoubtedly, artificial intelligence, 
to analyse not only transactions but also richer KYC data. However, these tools will 
never replace human judgement, and their models must be both understandable and 
auditable.  
Artificial intelligence is only one aspect of the ongoing revolution. It has become very 
easy to falsify supporting documents and we need to rely more on robust evidence, 
especially by facilitating access to public databases. It is now very quick and easy to 
open and use multiple bank accounts remotely throughout the EU. I am therefore 
delighted that the new European regulation provides an ambitious framework for – both 
private-private and public-private – information-pooling partnerships as well as the 
interconnection of European bank account registers, extended to crypto-assets by 2029 
at the latest. Following the French Parliament's recent adoption of Deputy Labaronne's 
bill, the Banque de France will deploy a new interbank platformto quickly  in 2026 
identify fraudster bank accounts, thereby "making life difficult for the bad guys", to use 
one of Antoine Magnant's favourite expressions. 
Anticipation and cooperation
Since its foundation, Tracfin has played an essential role in anticipating changing 
. Its work is now rounded out by the national risk analysis developed under the threats
aegis of France's AML/CTF Advisory Committee, and its sector-specific versions, 
including the one prepared by the ACPR. Just as all Committee members are preparing 
the third edition of these documents, I would like to commend the professionals who 
participate in our workshops, like that currently underway on the laundering of proceeds 
from illegal online gambling in liaison with the French National Gaming Authority and 
Tracfin.  
No institution can tackle these changes alone, and that is the whole point of our 
partnership. At European level, AMLA, the new European agency responsible for 
combating money laundering, could be a major step forward, provided it does not fall 
into the trap of bureaucracy instead of adopting a risk-based approach. In terms of 
supervision, it will enable better control of 100% digital players, who often operate 
without any geographical base. From the perspective of financial intelligence units, it 
will provide the means of dealing with transnational suspicious transactions linked to 
complex criminal networks via pass-through accounts or shell companies. However, to 
succeed, AMLA will need to guarantee a genuine level playing field by standardising 
requirements and avoiding any levelling down in favour of the "least demanding" 
jurisdictions in regulatory terms. 

4/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Lastly, AMLA will also need to exert influence at level. To do this, it will  international 
need to improve Member States' compliance with FATF standards – and prevent them 
from appearing on the grey list. It will also need to influence these standards through 
the quality and exemplary nature of its work. I already see one priority area: the 
finalisation and effective deployment of FATF Recommendation 16 on the transparency 
of international payments, which now applies to cryptoassets. This is a very positive 
step forward. The objective of this recommendation is clear: to ensure the traceability of 
cross-border flows so that crypto-asset transactions are as transparent as those that go 
through the traditional banking system. France has been particularly proactive in 
ensuring that all forms of transfers are treated in the same way, whether they involve 
crypto-assets, card payments or instant transfers. AMLA can make a 
concrete contribution by making this issue one of its first joint projects, particularly by 
applying the 'travel rule' to crypto-assets.
Beyond Europe's borders, international cooperation remains essential. However, 
certain recent signals from Washington could be a genuine cause for concern. I am 
referring here to the US administration's leniency vis-à-vis certain large crypto 
platforms, which are exposed to major money laundering risks. The end of the 
requirement for US companies to declare their beneficial owners is also a regrettable 
development. Lastly, certain measures, if confirmed, would ease the reporting 
requirements for US banks, which would no longer have to justify a failure to submit 
STRs.
That is why, as part of our G7 Presidency, France will make the fight against financial 
crime one of its priorities, following in Canada's footsteps.
 
I would like to finish with these words from Albert Einstein: "The world will not be 
destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch and do nothing." Inaction in the 
domain of AML-CFT has a cost.  Tax and social security fraud and drug trafficking cost 
our economy nearly EUR 50 billion every year. EUR 50 billion that undermine our social 
model and erodes confidence in our institutions. Combating the laundering of these 
criminal flows is therefore not just a matter of compliance but, above all, it is a matter of 
justice, trust, and a matter of restoring our public finances. This is the whole point of the 
work we are undertaking together, that you will continue this afternoon during the 
various round-table discussions. Thank you.
i Number of reporting entities registered by Tracfin across all sectors (financial and non-
financial). 
Between H1 2024 and H1 2025, suspicious transaction reports (STRs) received by ii
Tracfin from the financial sector increased by 22.5%, and those from the non-financial 
sector by 34%, giving a total increase of approximately 24%.
