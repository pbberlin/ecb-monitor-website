It is a pleasure to be back in Brussels for our regular exchange.
Since we last met in December, the new US administration has taken office and 
embarked on a new course in domestic and foreign policy. This has far-reaching 
implications for the global economic and political landscape, and it forces Europe to 
address both long-standing and new challenges in trade, economic competitiveness 
and defence. It is clear that the world is not waiting for us.
In this context, your chosen topic of trade policies is pertinent and extremely timely. 
However, before we discuss that topic in more detail, let me start by updating you on 
the euro area economic outlook and the ECB's monetary policy stance.
The outlook for the euro area
In 2024 the euro area economy recovered despite many headwinds. Euro area GDP 
grew by 0.9% on average, about twice as much as it did in 2023. Growth slowed in the 
fourth quarter of 2024, however, and the first months of this year have seen a 
continuation of many of last year's underlying patterns. Manufacturing is still 
contracting, although survey indicators are improving. High domestic and global policy 
uncertainty is holding back investment, and competitiveness challenges are weighing 
on exports. At the same time, services remain resilient. Moreover, rising household 
incomes and a robust labour market are supporting a gradual pick-up in consumption.
Heightened uncertainty is likely to dampen investment and exports more than 
previously anticipated. However, growth is expected to be supported by higher incomes 
and lower borrowing costs. Additionally, exports should benefit from rising global 
demand, though this remains contingent on developments in international trade 
policies. The latest ECB staff projections expect the economy to grow by 0.9% in 2025, 
1.2% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027.These estimates are subject to considerable 1 
uncertainty, also owing to the trade policy environment, which I will discuss in the 
second part of my statement.
Turning to price developments, the disinflation process is well on track. Headline 
inflation decreased from 2.5% in January to 2.3% in February, mainly on account of a 
drop in energy inflation. Core inflation – excluding energy and food – also declined 
slightly from 2.7% in January to 2.6% in February, reflecting lower services inflation. 
Domestic inflation edged down in February but remains high, as wages and services 
prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge.

Nominal wage growth moderated over the course of 2024. It is expected to continue 
decelerating in the coming months as real wages have caught up with levels seen 
before the surge in inflation, leading to fewer demands for inflation compensation.
The ECB staff projections see inflation moderating slightly in the coming months and 
then hovering around our 2% target as of the first quarter of 2026. Headline inflation is 
expected to average 2.3% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027.
The ECB's monetary policy stance
Let me now turn to our monetary policy stance.
Earlier this month we lowered our key interest rates by another 25 basis points. Inflation 
is developing broadly as expected, with most measures of underlying inflation 
suggesting that inflation will settle at around our 2% medium-term target on a sustained 
basis.
The deposit facility rate now stands at 2.50% – 150 basis points below the 2024 peak. 
Our monetary policy is becoming meaningfully less restrictive. New borrowing is 
becoming less expensive for firms and households, while loan growth is picking up. At 
the same time, past interest rate hikes are still being transmitted to the stock of loans, 
and lending remains subdued overall.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our 2% medium-
term target. Especially in current conditions of rising uncertainty, we will follow a data-
dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary 
policy stance. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
The impact of a shift in US trade policies
Let me now turn to the second topic of this hearing – the impact of the shift in US trade 
policies on the euro area.
The new US administration is changing direction in several policy areas, with trade 
being a focal point. As a result, uncertainty about the future path of trade policy has 
soared to exceptionally high levels.
In our interconnected world, increased trade frictions are detrimental to global growth 
and welfare.They raise costs, disrupt production and often lead to an adjustment of 2 
supply chains.This also encourages "tit-for-tat" retaliatory policies, further undermining 3 
the benefits of free trade.
The euro area, which is very open to trade and deeply integrated into global supply 
chains, especially with the United States, is particularly exposed to shifts in trade 
policies.4
As regards the impact of specific trade measures, the situation is of course still 
evolving, and any estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty. That said, ECB 
analysis suggests that a US tariff of 25% on imports from Europe would lower euro area 

3/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
growth by about 0.3 percentage points in the first year. A European response in the 
form of raising tariffs on US imports would further increase this to about half a 
percentage point. The brunt of the impact on economic growth would concentrate 
around the first year after the rise in tariffs; it would then diminish over time, however 
leaving a persistent negative effect on the level of output.
In such a scenario, the inflation outlook would become significantly more uncertain. In 
the near term, EU retaliatory measures and a weaker euro exchange rate – resulting 
from lower US demand for European products – could lift inflation by around half a 
percentage point. The effect would ease in the medium term due to lower economic 
activity dampening inflationary pressures.
Let me stress again that these estimates are subject to very high uncertainty given that 
the impact of tariff increases may be non-linear, for instance due to a significant 
reconfiguration of global supply chains. Of course, the high level of policy uncertainty 
requires us to remain vigilant and ready to act to protect price stability.
Crucially, the answer to the current shift in US trade policies should be more, not less, 
trade integration, both with trade partners around the globe and within the EU. Trade 
integration, including free trade agreements, has been a driver of economic prosperity 
and can protect against unilateral trade measures. In fact, ECB analysis indicates that 
closer integration with the rest of the world could more than offset losses incurred from 
unilateral tariffs, including retaliation. In such a scenario only countries engaging in 
isolationist policies stand to lose. It is therefore important that the EU remains open to 
trade, and swiftly finalising recent trade agreements with other international partners 
would be a powerful signal.
We must also use these developments as a catalyst for deepening trade between EU 
Member States. The Single Market is estimated to have added between 12% and 22% 
to long-run EU GDP in its first 30 years,and the level of trade between Member States 5 
has doubled since its creation.6
A deeper Single Market is crucial for reducing trade barriers within Europe and creating 
the scale necessary for firms to thrive. In addition, the more we exploit our own market, 
the more resilient Europe is to the impact of global fragmentation and external shocks 
more generally. With its Competitiveness Compass, the European Commission has put 
forward a concrete roadmap that should be urgently implemented. In this context, the 
plan for the savings and investment union presented yesterday is another crucial step.
By enhancing our strategic autonomy and increasing our economic clout, Europe 
negotiates with trade partners from a position of greater strength – strength that we can 
only gain collectively.
At the ECB, we will continue to carefully monitor global trade developments and take 
their impact into account in our monetary policy deliberations. In the current 
environment, it is important that we anticipate and assess implications of potential trade 
policy changes.Careful analysis and communication are key, and we are exploring 7 
both aspects further as part of our ongoing strategy assessment.

Conclusion
To conclude – in today's turbulent environment, only a united Europe is a stronger 
Europe.
Jean Monnet once said "make men – – work together;  and might I also add women 
show them that, beyond their differences and geographical boundaries, there lies a 
common interest".
This common interest is the prosperity of people in the EU. To achieve it, we must 
continue to uphold free trade, and we must strengthen our union.
The Single Market enables this, as it can contain the impact of global trade 
fragmentation. Let us continue to strengthen this precious tool and forge our own 
destiny in the interest of all Europeans.
Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to your questions.
1 Tariffs that were already in effect when the March 2025 ECB staff projections were 
finalised (on 19 February 2025) were included in the baseline projections – namely the 
first batch of bilateral tariffs between the United States and China. Other tariffs that 
were not yet in place at the cut-off date and those that had been postponed or had only 
recently been announced were not included in the baseline projections.
