Olli Rehn: Macroeconomic policy in times of global political upheaval
Keynote speech by Mr Olli Rehn, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the Bank of 
Finland and Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) joint conference "Frontiers 
of monetary economics in the 21st century: where and where to?", Helsinki, 13 May 
2025.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Colleagues and Friends,
Welcome to the sunny, spring-time Helsinki. On behalf of the Bank of Finland and the 
Centre for Economic Policy Research, it is my great pleasure to open this year's 
research conference on monetary economics – which again has an excellent and a 
most fascinating programme!
Let me begin with a mission statement – and a confession. Our slogan at the Bank of 
Finland is: "Securing stability – in science we trust." That is, we lean on evidence- and 
theory-based economic analysis and policy-relevant research to support our stability 
mission.
However, I must make a confession. In this turbulent world, it is comforting to return to a 
familiar setting and reflect on policy challenges alongside leading economists. Although 
only eight months have passed since our last gathering, it feels like the global 
landscape has shifted dramatically.
And the confession is this, in front of you as researchers, scholars, scientists, leading 
economists; in these times of pervasive uncertainty, we need plenty of judgment and 
scenario analysis to supplement our economic and econometric research and 
regression equations, thus making monetary policy, by necessity, is as much an art as 
a science. Such is life in these strange times – but finally, at least, it dis make me 
understand why the Governor at Bank of Finland is,, also the chair of the arts  ex officio
committee of the Bank!
Talking about geopolitics and its effects, just look at the ECB's evolving language. 
Uncertainty went from "increased" to "high," then "pervasive," and now, per President 
Lagarde, "exceptional." This isn't linguistic inflation. It reflects how genuinely hard 
forecasting has become, with markets pricing in risk at levels not seen in years.
Risks abound: from trade wars to faltering global alliances. For central bankers and 
researchers alike, this is no time for complacency. Instead of dissecting every new risk, 
today I want to focus on three key areas:
Lessons from the recent inflation surge;
Open questions around fiscal policy, particularly defence spending;
And finally, the role of productivity and innovation.
Low inflation – past and future

2/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Let's nevertheless recall there are some good news. The European economy is 
recovering. Unemployment is at 6.1%, the lowest since the euro's creation. Inflation has 
been hovering just above 2% since late 2023, allowing the ECB to cut rates seven 
times.
The energy shock that hit Europe in spring 2022 has played out very differently than in 
the 1970s, with the economic cost being much lower this time. Thanks to increased 
labour supply and lower working hours, wage-price spirals were avoided. Today's 
labour market is more flexible, less unionised, and better educated.
Importantly, inflation expectations were much better anchored before the recent inflation 
surge. This underlies the importance of central bank independence and a strong 
commitment to the inflation target. The ECB has focused firmly on maintaining these, 
and will continue to do so.
Before Covid, the main challenge was that inflation remained stubbornly below the 
target. Most risks to the inflation outlook were deflationary, including population ageing 
and the related increase in savings, and the low investment demand. And before the 
ECB's 2021 review and move to a symmetric 2% target over the medium term, which 
has worked well, the inflation target was perceived as a ceiling, creating a downward 
bias.
From around 2021, inflationary pressures reappeared. First this was due to the 
pandemic-broken supply chains and stimulus-fuelled demand, then due to the energy 
shocks arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
We learned how demand and supply shocks can be deeply intertwined. But we still face 
many unknowns in that regard. Current geopolitical tensions may expose us to new 
surprises that we have little historical experience of. Preferably, the spectre of a 
prolonged trade war with the US will dissipate sooner rather than later, as an economic 
conflict between long-standing friends and allies is the last thing we need in a world 
challenged by dictatorial impulses and by a neocolonial mentality.
Furthermore, what if China shifts exports away from the US to Europe, slashing prices 
to compete? That could bring deflationary forces and industrial strain to the EU. Would 
it benefit consumers or hurt our economy overall? The policy response would not be 
straightforward.
Let's hope we don't have to answer these questions through crisis. Whatever the 
challenge, the ECB will remain focused on price stability and its symmetric 2% inflation 
target over the medium term.
Defence spending – new pressures
Since the pandemic, fiscal spending pressures have risen. Now, security concerns are 
adding fuel. Russia's aggression and doubts about US defence commitments are 
prompting big spending shifts across Europe. Germany is paving the way and has 
eased its constitutional debt limits.

3/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
We can assume that with normal execution lags the most substantial fiscal impact will 
start to be felt from next year 2026 and 2027 onwards. This implies that the fiscal 
impact on the growth and inflation outlook will take effect in the medium term, as an 
ordinary citizen perceives is, although this timespan of fiscal impulse will mostly be 
beyond the projection horizon of medium term as understood in monetary policy. Our 
assessment indicate a moderately significant impact on growth and limited impact on 
inflation in the relevant timespan.
Waking up and substantially increasing defence spending is welcome. Security is the 
bedrock of economic stability. Peace and security within European borders are 
fundamental to the European project and its economy.  Defence should be seen as a 
European public good. Further support for Ukraine should also be seen in the same 
light.
But what does this mean for inflation? Historical comparisons to war-time money 
printing don't apply here. Independent central banks like the ECB remain focused on 
keeping inflation expectations anchored.
Still, we need to understand what type of shock defence spending represents. Is it 
demand or supply driven? Likely both, depending on how and where the money is 
spent.
We also face the question ofto pay for it. EU-level spending would offer more  how  
stability and efficiency. That might mean higher membership fees, new revenue 
sources, or even treaty changes. Defence bonds – as safe assets – are one option, but 
only if backed by solid future income.
Meanwhile, demands on public budgets are rising across the board: infrastructure, 
climate policy, aging populations.
What guidance do we have so far from economics research?
There is a large body of literature on fiscal multipliers, which incidentally often uses 
defence spending as a natural experiment or exogenous shock. These multipliers are 
frequently estimated to be below one, because public spending or investment usually 
crowds out private one.
However, evidence suggests that multipliers tend to be larger in times of recession and 
economic slack. Moreover, some of the best evidence on the magnitude of fiscal 
multipliers is based on US data, where the multiplier may be smaller. This is simply 
because the US defence industry is very large compared to its European counterpart 
and is thus more likely to face diminishing marginal returns.
All these issues mean that for European defence spending to be successful and 
sustainable, we must make every euro count. The additional defence spending should 
focus on investment in building up industrial network capacity and R&D, rather than 
simply procurement of defence equipment, which may be largely imported.
Then there is also the aspect of defence efficiency. For this, we need sound planning 
and coordination at the European level, as well as a common market for defence, as 

4/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
stressed in last year's Letta Report. Recent experience has shown that training in the 
use of unfamiliar weapons and problems with shortages of spare parts can become 
critical bottlenecks. Therefore, further harmonisation of technical standards and types of 
arms and equipment across European defence forces is key.
With a history of independent and diminished national defence industries, the EU has 
some considerable catching up to do. We need to increase both national and EU-level 
defence spending, e.g. as Bruegel has suggested, by establishing a European Defence 
Mechanism formed by a coalition of the capable and willing. Such a fund would bypass 
the limitations to raising EU-level income, be resilient to any intra-EU obstruction and 
could also accommodate countries from outside the European Union, like the United 
Kingdom and Norway.
In short: defence spending won't necessarily be inflationary. But to be effective, it must 
be efficient. We need smart investments – in industrial capacity, innovation, and R&D – 
not just procurement. And we must avoid fragmented efforts. A European Defence 
Mechanism, built by a coalition of the capable and willing, could also help to pursue 
these goals.
Innovation – defence and civilian
Let's now turn to innovation. Defence spending often yields big returns beyond the 
battlefield. Its effectiveness should be assessed from a long-term perspective, not only 
via short-run multipliers. Historically, it has given rise to technological breakthroughs 
that have not only found direct civilian applications but created whole new non-defence 
industries.
Walkie-talkies were created during the Second World War at Motorola for infantry and 
artillery communication. Radar gave us microwave ovens. Military satellites gave us 
GPS and digital imaging. Jet engines, nuclear energy, the internet – all have military 
origins. Dual-use in action.
Yes, these are cherry-picked examples. But they highlight that basic research often 
needs public support. The private sector tends to shy away from "unknown unknowns."
Modern defence is about technology, not just steel and troops. And there's often more 
pressure to innovate efficiently. Look at Ukraine – it has rapidly developed drone tech, 
despite scarce resources.
We know that Europe needs a productivity boost. For years, we depended on cheap 
energy from Russia, cheap goods from China and the security shield from the U.S. 
abroad. That stability was a mirage, if not a hallucination.
To maintain our living standards and sovereignty, we must double down on innovation 
by investing on human capital and creating a conducive environment for research and 
researchers. Whether it's AI, clean tech, green transition or digitalisation, we can't afford 
to lag behind. Innovation is not optional; it's vital for Europe's future – a necessary 
condition for sustaining Europe's quality of life and democratic values.

Why not use the EU Horizon programme to create a scholarship and visa programme 
for returning and moving scientists to attract talent to Europe, where critical thinking and 
academic freedom in universities are encouraged and safeguarded?
Dear friends,
Let me conclude. Europe finds itself in a puzzling paradox, which would be funny if it 
were not purely pathetic. As Polish PM Donald Tusk put it starkly recently by quipping 
as follows: "500 million Europeans are asking 300 million Americans to protect them 
from 140 million Russians."
We need to put an end to that paradox. Europe must take responsibility for its own 
external security, in today's harsh geopolitical world.
This isn't just about military strength. It's about cohesion, economic resilience and long-
term growth. We need to spark Europe's industrial renewal, reinforce technological 
leadership, and enhance productivity.
As history shows, Europe tends to move forward in times of crisis. In every crisis there 
is an opportunity – this time round we must use it particularly wisely to make Europe 
more resilient and capable of thriving again.
Thank you.
