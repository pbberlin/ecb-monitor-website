François Villeroy de Galhau: A shared conviction for Europe
Speech of Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, delivered 
for the departure of Robert Holzmann, Governor of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, 
Vienna, 3 September 2025.

This conviction is rooted primarily in the long term and it is important to measure how 
far we have come over the last 25 years. The euro is a tremendous popular success: 
support for our single currency has never been stronger (83% in the euro area). To say i
that Robert and I have not always agreed on monetary policy decisions is an 
understatement, but I know few people holding such different positions who have 
remained such good friends. This tells us two things: first, that Robert is a very likeable 
person and, second, that along with our colleagues, we have always been able to 
discuss and then decide. In 2021-22, the Governing Council of the European Central 
Bank (ECB) was confronted with soaring inflation. Robert, last week I read in the FAZ 
that you were referring to the ECB's past "mistakes". I can reassure you that you can 
rest easy on that score. I don't believe we made mistakes. You can even be proud of 
our decisive and effective monetary action. In less than three years, we have brought 
inflation back down to our 2% target, without any economic pain in terms of recession 
or unemployment. The victory over inflation has now been secured. 
In order to consolidate this victory in the long term, we Europeans must defend the 
independence of central banks in the face of the serious regressions of the Trump 
administration. No, this is not an anomaly of democracy. On the contrary, independence 
has been conferred by democracy, and it is attacking this independence in contradiction 
with American law that is dangerous for democracy. No, independence is not just for us 
central bankers; it serves all citizens. And no, independence is not an obstacle to 
reasonably low interest rates: on the contrary, it is a prerequisite for them, as it allows 
inflation to be controlled in the long term and anchors the expectations of economic 
agents. Faced with the risks of 'privatisation' and 'de-Europeanisation' of the currency 
posed by the rise of stablecoins, we Europeans are strong supporters of the digital euro 
for retail payments, as well as a wholesale digital currency for financial markets.
Now more than ever, we Europeans need to translate this success in terms of monetary 
sovereignty into economic and financial sovereignty. Our two countries and Europe now 
have a choice: either they continue with the low growth, low productivity and low 
innovation of the last thirty years, or they opt for a general mobilisation.And, clearly, ii 
the recent "tectonic" upheavals are increasing the challenges: the protectionist shock iii 
together with the shock of unpredictability unleashed by the Trump administration are 
detrimental to both price stability and growth. 
Our destiny is in our own hands. I really hope that this general mobilisation comes 
quickly – much more quickly. The Draghi and Letta reports in 2024 and the European 
Commission's Savings and Investment Union strategy can be summarised in three 
points, the three "i's'': integrating the single market more, investing better through a 
Savings and Investment Union, and innovating faster by cutting bureaucracy – or to use 
physiological words, we need to multiply economic size by financial muscle and speed

of execution. At the same time, the euro area – including my own country – needs 
stable and sustainable public finances to meet these challenges.
