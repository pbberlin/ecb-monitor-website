Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,
Let me start by thanking the organisers for the invitation to share some thoughts with 
you here at the Citi Macro Forum today. In my introductory remarks, I will discuss the 
euro area economic and policy outlook following our ECB Governing Council monetary 
policy meeting last week.
As you know, we at the Governing Council started discussing the dialling back of our 
restrictive monetary policy stance in March, and we continued that discussion in our 
meeting last week.
Slide 2. Economic activity in the euro area, 2007-2026
What makes this discussion particularly interesting is the fact that this time we are 
considering easing our monetary policy stance simultaneously with a projected start of 
recovery in domestic demand and a record low unemployment rate. Growth is projected 
to pick up in the course of the second half of this year and to strengthen in the 2025-
2026.
This interesting policy situation reflects the unconventional path that has led us to this 
point over the past one and a half decades.
Slide 3. Three periods of inflation in the euro era, 1999-2024
Let me illustrate this trajectory with a graph that neatly divides the last quarter century 
of the euro era into three periods of inflation: approx. 2% in 1999-2009; 1.2% in 2009-
21; and 6.6 % since 2021.
It is worth remembering that only three years ago, in 2021, we had had 13 years of too 
low inflation behind us, although we had resorted to a negative policy rate for seven 
years, and to significant asset purchases and credit operations as well, which took our 
balance sheet from 2 trillion to almost 9 trillion euros. This stubbornly low inflation, 
together with a structurally low natural rate of interest and very limited remaining policy 
space, led us to launch the review of our monetary policy strategy in January 2020. It 
was concluded in July 2021.
Slide 4. The ECB strategy review and symmetric inflation target
The key outcome of the strategy review was that we decided to change our inflation 
target to a symmetric one, meaning that both negative and positive deviations from the 
2% target are regarded as equally undesirable. Prior to the review, our price stability

definition ('below but close to 2%') was perceived as asymmetric, effectively setting a 
2% ceiling for inflation. This asymmetry very likely contributed to lowering inflation 
expectations and thereby inflation itself. The new symmetric inflation target is expected 
to influence long-term inflation expectations and to anchor them more solidly to the 2% 
inflation target.
When we published our new symmetric inflation target in July 2021, the operating 
environment for monetary policy was changing dramatically.
Slide 5. Inflation is converging towards the ECB's 2% target
The supply shocks, caused first by the pandemic and then by Russia's unjustified and 
brutal war in Ukraine, pushed the euro area inflation rate above 2.5% for the first time in 
nine years by the fall of 2021, and then all the way up to 10.6% in October 2022.
Thanks to the normalisation of energy prices and the determined but very consistent 
monetary tightening, euro area HICP inflation is now at 2.4%. It is expected to decline 
further, reaching our inflation target next year.
When I addressed this forum a year and a half ago, in October 2022, the uncertainty 
related to energy supply in Europe was extreme. Rationing of energy supplies was 
widely discussed. So were the various risk scenarios, some containing severe 
stagflationary tendencies. At the time, energy was the key driver of euro area inflation, 
while moderate wage inflation was acting as an anchor.
Subsequently, Europe reacted decisively and cut the energy crisis short. Today, wages 
have replaced energy as the main inflation driver – but wage growth is now moderating 
and inflation declining.
Due to the energy price assumptions, our inflation forecasts overestimated actual 
inflation in the fourth quarter last year. For this year, our assumptions and inflation 
forecasts have been more accurate, although in March we did revise down our inflation 
forecast for this year to 2.3%. In September last year, our 2024 inflation forecast was at 
3.2%, so we have in fact been approaching our target faster than we had expected at 
the time we raised the policy rate to the current level.
However, disinflation is more than just a story of the reversal in energy price 
movements. Monetary policy has played an important role in dampening demand since 
the rate hiking cycle started in July 2022. Monetary restraint is continuing to reduce 
inflation and impact the real economy strongly, affecting the growth outlook, particularly 
for this year. In March, we also revised down our growth forecast for this year to 0.6%.
Slide 6. Wage growth is moderating in the euro area
The euro area unemployment rate has remained at a record low and employment has 
increased, even though growth has been at a standstill since the end of 2022. This said, 
there are indications that labour demand is now adjusting downwards. Recent euro 
area wage growth has been developing broadly in line with our expectations, slowing 
from 5% to 4%. Importantly, a key driver of wage growth has been past inflation 
surprises rather than higher inflation expectations.

Slide 7. Inflation expectations remain well anchored to the target
Inflation expectations have in fact been well anchored at around our 2% target, as can 
be seen from this slide.
Referring to the ongoing weak demand conditions in the euro area, and in the spirit of 
the multilateral IMF and World Bank spring meetings this week, I would like to draw 
your attention to the developments in the euro area current account. In the March 
projections, the forecast for the current account surplus was revised significantly 
upwards, from 1% to 3.2% of GDP for the current year and similarly for the two 
following years.
As we know, the current account can be defined as the difference between investment 
and savings. This definition provides a useful viewpoint when assessing the effects of 
recent monetary policy tightening and its strong transmission. An increase in the current 
account surplus may reflect a lower level of investment or higher level of savings – or 
both, which seems to be the case in the euro area currently.
An important factor contributing to a higher euro area current account is the low level of 
business and housing investment, which are expected to be very weak this year. This is 
reflected in the weak credit demand due to higher interest rates and also somewhat 
tighter credit supply. As bank profitability is not expected to remain as strong as before 
and credit risks are increasing somewhat, the supply factors may start to play a bigger 
role in credit extension, while credit demand is expected to start recovering.
If weaker investments are contributing to a stronger current account, so too are higher 
savings. The savings rate increased to 14.6%, which is clearly above the pre-pandemic 
13%.
Of course, tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates play a major role in 
explaining the higher savings rate. However, uncertainty and low confidence also 
incentivise higher savings. The continuation of the Russian war has probably had more 
complex and wide-ranging effects on confidence and savings than we can currently 
estimate.
The ECB, major forecasters like the IMF, central bank watchers and the current pricing 
in the financial markets all seem to agree that the euro area inflation rate will return to 
our 2% target in a sustained manner in the course of next year. Since prolonged high 
inflation could put the well-anchored inflation expectations at risk, any further delay in 
achieving the target cannot, of course, be accepted.
Slide 8. The ECB decisions in April
The key message from our policy meeting last week was that although the key ECB 
interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing 
disinflation process, we no longer see the need to maintain them at the current levels 
for a long duration.

It is also worth noting that with the extent of disinflation already seen, real short-term 
rates are now higher than we expected them to be when the policy rate was raised to 
the current level last September.
With declining inflation and delayed economic growth, we are continuously assessing 
how restrictive our policy stance is and should be. Without prejudging our primary 
objective of price stability we need to avoid a stance that unduly delays the closing of 
the negative output gap.
The risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. Russia's unjustified war 
against Ukraine and the intensified conflict in the Middle East are major sources of 
geopolitical risk, feeding uncertainty and potentially increasing energy prices again. 
Clearly, geopolitics is the risk factor that could derail the improving outlook for the euro 
area economy.
As headline inflation and underlying inflation have continued to slow down and inflation 
expectations have remained well anchored, we can start dialling back monetary 
restraint as summer approaches. Provided that we are confident that inflation will 
continue converging to our 2% target in a sustained way, the time will be ripe in June to 
start easing the monetary policy stance and to cut rates. This obviously assumes that 
there will be no further setbacks in the geopolitical situation and thus in energy prices.
We in the ECB Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-
by-meeting approach when determining the pertinent policy stance. We will set our 
rates based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of 
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission. And we are not pre-
committing to any rate path.
Thank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to your questions.
