Chair, Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Colleagues,
Thank you for the invitation to speak today.
In , Adam Smith wrote: The Wealth of Nations  "It is the maxim of every prudent master 
of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to

multilateral order – has long been a pillar of prosperity.
Today, that system is under pressure. Tariffs are back – and their economic effects are 
clearly negative across the board: short-term, medium-term, and long-term. There are 
few things economists agree on more than the benefits of free trade.
The Shadow of Geopolitics
We are now living through a sharp geopolitical shift. As globalisation and multilateralism 
frays, Europe finds itself at a crossroads.
Europe's security environment is also being reshaped – not unlike in the early 1990s, 
but in reverse. The end of the Cold War brought integration and optimism. Today, 
power politics and fragmentation are making a troubling return. Uncertainty has become 
the defining feature of the economic and political outlook, globally and in Europe.
Euro Area: Recovery Meets Trade Headwinds
Recent data showed signs of recovery in the euro area. Employment is solid, and 
unemployment is at a historic low of 6.1%. Private consumption has benefited from 
stronger real incomes. Investments in Europe's common defence and infrastructure will 
bolster manufacturing further. We've been building up resilience against global shocks.
Yet the renewed trade war is already weakening this momentum. Many of the downside 
risks highlighted in the ECB's March projections have materialised, and the growth 
outlook has suffered.
Recent market turbulence has also been due to central bank independence having 
been questioned. There is a vast body of empirical research that demonstrates the 
paramount importance of central bank independence for stable prices, well-anchored 
inflation expectations, sustainable growth and high employment. In Europe, central

bank independence is firmly anchored in the Treaty on European Union. It works in 
principle and in practice in the Eurosystem.
Inflation and Interest Rates
Good news from Europe is that inflation in the euro area is stabilising at the ECB's 2% 
target. Disinflation is well on track.
Economists largely agree that large tariff increases will accelerate inflation in the US, 
but in the euro area the effects on inflation are two-way: the tariff hikes increase certain 
prices, but slower growth dampens inflation.
Most economists also assumed that the euro would weaken because of the US tariffs. 
However, this has not happened, quite the opposite.
Against this growth and inflation outlook, we decided last week at the ECB Governing 
Council to cut rates again by 25 basis points. Since last June, we've cut rates seven 
times – from 4% to 2.25%. These moves support consumption and investment in the 
face of global headwinds.
Our next monetary policy meeting will take place in June. If inflation is then projected to 
fall below our 2 percent target in the medium term, in my view the right reaction in 
monetary policy would be to cut rates further, in line with our strategy. But that depends 
on data and our assessment. Under pervasive uncertainty today, the Governing Council 
maintains full freedom of action in monetary policy. In any case, we will adjust our rates 
to bring inflation to 2% in the medium term – just as our strategy tells us to do.
An all-out trade war would weaken economic output worldwide, which is already felt in 
market turbulence. Various calculations show that US tariffs targeting imports from the 
EU, China and the rest of the world could reduce global GDP by some 0.5 to 1.0 
percent in the next few years.1
In the face of protectionism, Europe will not lie down in the fire. The European 
Commission has rightly suggested a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the EU and 
the US. While Europe remains committed to constructive negotiations with the US, the 
Commission has been preparing proportionate countermeasures to reinforce our 
negotiating position, with the aim of reaching a solution that benefits everybody.
Amid Russia's brutal war in Ukraine, the last thing we need is a trade war between 
allies. Nobody benefits from it, apart from Putin and Xi.
Furthermore, Europe is deepening trade ties beyond the transatlantic relationship. We 
have over 44 FTAs covering 76 countries, nearly half of EU external trade, including 
with Japan, South Korea, and Canada.
Ratifying the Mercosur deal should be the next step. Moreover, new free trade 
agreements with India, Indonesia, and Australia are underway.
Europe's Internal Challenge: Productivity

3/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Externally, trade conflict is the challenge. Internally, our Achilles heel is weak 
productivity growth. Ageing populations, the green transition, and security demands all 
require large-scale investment and structural reform.
The Draghi Report on EU competitiveness offers a sobering but clear-eyed diagnosis. 
Its key prescriptions: deepen the Single Market and streamline regulation. These have 
now been boosted as key priorities of the EU.
In assessing Europe's economic prospects, we cannot ignore current security 
challenges. Whether we like it or not, power politics is back, and it is bad news for the 
global community.
What does this mean for Europe? I do fully concur with ECB President Christine 
Lagarde who said that it is now an opportune moment for us Europeans to take our 
destiny into our own hands. She is right: only by remaining united and steadfast both in 
matters of security and in shaping a dynamic, resilient economy, Europe can weather 
the geopolitical storm.
We are fully aware that the current geopolitical rock-bottom necessitates a strong, 
united Europe, capable of defending itself as a key pillar of Nato, but even without 
relying on external support. As in the past, Europe works best when we act together, 
pool our resources and share responsibilities.
At the same time, we will work for more effective European institutional arrangements 
that better serve the common good. This will require a more impactful and possibly 
larger EU budget, along with a more efficient use of funds and streamlined decision-
making structures. The international role of the euro is strengthened by the stability of 
democracy, the rule of law and economy in Europe. We are also working for a digital 
euro for the sake of strategic autonomy. The prospect of a European safe asset and 
deeper capital markets would support investment in common defence and the green 
transition while enhancing financial stability.
Resilience and the Financial System
Amid turbulence, Europe's banking and financial system has held up. EU banks remain 
resilient, bolstered by the reforms after the global financial crisis. Capital flows recently 
into the EU show investor confidence.
But resilience cannot be taken for granted. At the European Systemic Risk Board we 
are monitoring the non-bank spectrum and possible mainstreaming of crypto assets in 
the US with well-grounded concern.
At the same time, financial regulation must be smart and proportional. We must strike a 
careful balance between stability and innovation – simplifying where possible but 
avoiding deregulation.
Monetary Policy Lessons and Strategy
Over the last five years, we have faced an exceptional combination of demand and 
supply shocks. We have indeed gained a lot of understanding about the appropriate 

4/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
policy responses to such exceptional events. Much of this work will be summarised in 
the ongoing ECB strategy assessment.
In particular, we've learned that shocks are rarely "pure" supply or demand events. 
Covid, the energy crisis and war have blurred these lines – as has the trade war. Here, 
scenario analysis is vital, as stated in Ben Bernanke's review of the Bank of England. 
Our experience in the Eurosystem confirms that scenarios are most useful in analysing 
and communicating risks around the baseline during times of exceptional shocks.
Overall, uncertainty requires a comprehensive and pragmatic, even eclectic approach. 
Recall the 'Brainard principle' that high uncertainty calls for a more gradual response. In 
my view, the ECB's prudent stance before hiking rates in spring 2022, faced with the 
stagflationary outlook following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, well reflected this principle.
But it must be case-by-case. There are also strong arguments for decisive action in 
uncertain times, particularly when inflation expectations risk getting de-anchored. 
Monetary policy remains as much art as science.
Conclusion: Europe at a Turning Point
We are again in a moment of historic transition – but not one of expanding cooperation, 
as 30 years ago, but of fragmentation and strategic rivalry.
In this context, Europe will show unity and renewal. That means speeding up common 
defence and defence investment. Likewise, it means investing in competitiveness, 
productivity, and innovation. It means reinforcing research and academic excellence. 
And it means delivering stability – economic and financial – in a more dangerous world.
At the ECB, we will do our part by ensuring price and financial stability, thus laying the 
foundation for Europe's long-term resilience and success.
Thank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.
