1 Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to welcome you to our press conference, at which we will present our
annual accounts.
First Deputy Governor Sabine Mauderer will explain our annual accounts to you in more
detail in just a few moments. 
To begin, however, I would like to take a look at current developments in economic
activity and prices. I will then explain what conclusions I draw for our monetary policy
stance. And, at the end of my statement, I will present the most important ﬁgures from
our proﬁt and loss account.
2 Need for economic policy action in Germany
Two days on from the snap Bundestag election, the election results are at the focus of
attention among the media and the public as a whole.

6 Conclusion

There is a clear government mandate and a likely option for a coalition. In view of this, I
hope that a new government will be formed swiftly.
I am sure that all of the parties involved are cognisant of their responsibility: Germany
needs an effective government as soon as possible. A government that uses smart eco‐
nomic policy to enable the economy to get back on track. That puts the German
economy on a path to higher growth. By ensuring greater certainty of planning and
improving supply-side conditions.
At present, the German economy is in a state of stubborn stagnation. Real gross
domestic product has seen practically no growth since 2018. 
There was a rapid recovery from the sharp slump at the start of the coronavirus pan‐
demic. Since then, however, the economy has been moving more or less sideways.
Meanwhile, other countries such as the United States, but also many economies in the
euro area, are on course for growth.
The sluggishness in the German economy cannot be explained by cyclical headwinds
alone. Rather, structural problems play a key role.
In particular, export-oriented industry is under great pressure to adapt, which is due,
amongst other factors, to the high prices for energy. In addition, it needs to be better
prepared for the green transformation and absorb the impact of demographic change. 


Furthermore, on global markets, German enterprises are facing growing competition
from emerging market economies, which is intensiﬁed, in some cases, by subsidies.
Many enterprises are also bemoaning the ever higher bureaucratic hurdles and the large
ﬁscal burden required of them by the state. Not least, they are being hindered by the
lack of political reliability.
While private consumption is bolstering economic activity, it is seeing only very subdued
growth. One likely factor here is that the labour market is increasingly
gloomy. However, the uncertain economic outlook is also contributing to households’
reluctance to increase their consumer spending.
A slight economic recovery is expected over the course of the year. For the time being,
however, no meaningful upswing is in sight. In addition, there are risks from interna‐
tional trade and geopolitics. 
In any case, it is not possible to rule out a third consecutive calendar year with no
growth. This makes it all the more important that the new Federal Government swiftly
takes effective measures.
Germany continues to have strengths that should be leveraged and expanded upon:
stable institutions; enterprises that remain ﬁnancially sound and are adaptable and, in
many cases, highly innovative; a highly skilled and dedicated workforce; and an abun‐
dance of clever and creative minds.
Smart, consistent and reliable economic policymaking can unleash a sense of change
and increase the willingness for greater investment. I therefore hope that we will have a
government that will rouse “German Michel” from his slumber, to draw on an image
from “The Economist”.
We will soon be presenting the Bundesbank's proposals on how we can get the
German economy on a path to growth. In this way, the Bundesbank is fulﬁlling its statu‐
tory mandate to support and advise the Federal Government on matters of economic
policy.
3 Inflation in Germany
Our core mandate, however, is and remains to maintain price stability.

In Germany, the rate of inﬂation continued to fall last year: on an annual average, the
rate of inﬂation according to the European Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, or
HICP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices), stood at 2.5 %. 
Whilst it has fallen signiﬁcantly compared with the preceding years, it is still noticeably
above the medium-term target of 2 %. And it has risen again in recent months.
However, the uptick from 1.8 % in September to 2.8 % in January is not indicative of a
new wave of inﬂation. Instead, it mainly reﬂects the sharp decline in energy prices at
the end of 2023 and the associated base effect.
We therefore expect that the trend decline is intact and that inﬂation in Germany will
continue to fall. We anticipate that Germany will see a sustainable return to a level of
2 % in 2026.
Despite the prospective price stability, people are still burdened by the issue of inﬂation.
Surveys show that the fear of rising costs of living remains one of the biggest concerns
among people in Germany.  And this is not surprising, either. 
After all, the shock of exceptionally high inﬂation has left a deep impression. And the
decline in inﬂation rates does not, in fact, mean that prices will go back down again.
Certain prices will fall, of course. But we need to get used to a higher level of prices
overall.
[1]

Of course, another part of the bigger picture is that strong wage growth has now
largely offset the inﬂation-related losses in real income.
Our Bundesbank Online Panel reveals that households are no longer feeling the ﬁnan‐
cial burden of inﬂation as strongly this year as they did two years ago. However, a con‐
siderable proportion of people are still concerned or very concerned that the ﬁnancial
burdens on their household could become too high. 
This ﬁgure stands at just under 40 %. And, among households with a monthly net
income of less than €2,500, more than half are concerned.
Personal experiences of high inﬂation have a long-lasting impact. For example, they
inﬂuence inﬂation expectations for many years.  And dissatisfaction about high prices
and inﬂation can also be a political tinderbox.
4 Inflation and monetary policy in the euro area
This makes it all the more important for central banks to spare people the experience of
high inﬂation as far as possible. And to decisively combat excessively high inﬂation.
[2]

[4]

This is precisely what we on the ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council have
done. Through a historically unprecedented monetary policy turnaround, we have
helped to break the wave of inﬂation and keep inﬂation expectations anchored. The
inﬂation rate in the euro area continued to fall last year, dropping to an average of
2.4 % for 2024.
Incoming data suggest that we are likely to reach our medium-term target of 2 % over
the course of this year. This would allow us on the Governing Council to lower the key
interest rates further.
At this point, we have lowered the deposit facility rate ﬁve times; it currently stands at
2.75 %. That is probably no longer all that far from the neutral rate of interest, though
it is hard to pin down exactly what this rate is.  In addition, we in the Eurosystem have
progressed with our gradual shrinking of the balance sheet.
Overall, then, the outlook for prices is fairly encouraging. However, the persistently ele‐
vated core inﬂation and the undiminished strength of services inﬂation warrant a
degree of caution. This is especially true in light of the latest developments on the inﬂa‐
tion front. 
Headline inﬂation is now being driven primarily by services. Services inﬂation is, in any
event, much more sluggish than that of components such as energy and food. For
months now, it appears to be sticking to the 4 % mark.
[5]

Services make up nearly one-half of the statistical basket of goods. In order for headline
inﬂation to fall to 2 %, services prices also need to rise less sharply. And that is precisely
what we are expecting to happen, especially as wage pressures gradually recede in the
euro area.
On the other hand, inﬂation could conceivably also come in higher than the current
baseline scenario would suggest. If, for example, Europe feels compelled to respond to
protectionist measures with retaliatory tariffs, this would be associated with rising
import prices. As well as a further depreciation of the euro.
In view of the latest developments on the inﬂation front and given the high level of
uncertainty, it is wise to take one step at a time in terms of monetary policy. And not to
rush into further interest rate cuts. 
With this in mind, the Governing Council would be well advised to remain true to its
existing data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, and not to pre-commit to a
particular rate path. In the current uncertain environment, there is nothing to be gained
from publicly speculating on where we might stand, in terms of our interest rate policy,
in summer or at the end of the year. 
5 Annual accounts for 2024
The monetary policy tightening, involving ten interest rate moves in a row and a rise of
450 basis points, has no precedent in the euro area. That is undeniable. But this restric‐
tive monetary policy stance was appropriate and necessary in order to bring inﬂation
under control.
In conjunction with the non-standard expansionary monetary policy measures taken
previously, though, it also has signiﬁcant implications for the Bundesbank’s earnings sit‐
uation. And that will remain the case for many years to come.
Which brings me to our annual accounts.

As a reminder: in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis, the inﬂation rate remained stub‐
bornly and, at times, considerably below the target of 2 % for four years. The
Eurosystem’s monetary policy was therefore exceptionally loose for several years. 
The key interest rates were lowered to zero and below. The Eurosystem offered reﬁ‐
nancing operations at very attractive conditions, and banks made extensive use of
these. Above all, it purchased securities on a large scale, government bonds in
particular.
This resulted in a considerably expanded balance sheet: large holdings of low-interest,
long-dated securities accumulated on the assets side. While short-term variable rate
deposits rose on the liabilities side. This created substantial interest rate risk. 


The Bundesbank was aware of this risk and built up a provision for general risk in the
amount of just over €20 billion over a period of several years. The interest rate hikes in
2022 and 2023 caused this risk to materialise, and interest expenditure on the liabilities
side rose rapidly. At the same time, interest income from the bond portfolios remained
at a low level.
Thanks to the full release of the provision for general risk and the release of reserves,
the Bundesbank managed to record a balanced result in ﬁnancial year 2023.
Distributable proﬁt came to zero.


But that left just under €0.7 billion to cover further losses going forward. So it was on
the cards that we would have to report an accumulated loss for 2024. I indicated as
much at last year’s annual accounts press conference.  
Another thing I hinted at last year was that the highest annual burdens would be
behind us in 2024.  And, indeed, at €19.8 billion, the loss ﬁgure for 2024 is lower than
for 2023, when it totalled €21.6 billion. Subtracting the remaining reserves, this yields
an accumulated loss of €19.2 billion for 2024, which will be carried forward to subse‐
quent years and offset against future proﬁts.
Incidentally, the Bundesbank already recorded an accumulated loss back in the 1970s,
most recently in 1979. So you see, dealing with such situations is nothing fundamen‐
tally new for us.
For 1974, for example, the Bundesbank recorded an accumulated loss of 8.9 billion
Deutsche Mark. This was equivalent to just under 1 % of gross domestic product that
year. By way of comparison, the accumulated loss for 2024 corresponds to just under
0.5 % of 2024 GDP (gross domestic product). 
There are, of course, differences between then and now. The main factors shaping the
situation back then are not the same as the ones that are at play nowadays.

The ﬁnancial burdens are likely to be considerable again in the current year, but less so
than in 2024. Because with key interest rates back on the decline and the balance sheet
still shrinking, the earnings situation should improve considerably.
So peak annual burdens are likely to be behind us. However, losses are also to be
expected for the next few years. The accumulated loss, an item in which the annual
burdens from future periods will build up, will therefore increase for some years to
come.
After that, proﬁts can be expected once more. These will then be used to reduce the
accumulated loss and subsequently to build up new risk provisioning.
Proﬁt distributions to the Federal Government are therefore not a prospect for some
time yet. Since we do not know how the key interest rates and the other framework
parameters will evolve in the meantime, it would be unrealistic to give a speciﬁc date
for when proﬁt distributions will become possible again.
As unfortunate as it is that we cannot distribute proﬁts, it must be stressed that the
Bundesbank continues to have a sound balance sheet. It has high revaluation reserves.
This is particularly true for gold. 
The value of these reserves is many times greater than the current and prospective
accumulated losses. And that value rose steeply last year.


Sabine Mauderer will present you with more precise ﬁgures in a moment.
The Bundesbank is fully unrestricted in its ability to act. We can and will continue to do
all that is needed to ensure price stability.
6 Conclusion
Ladies and gentlemen, 
European monetary policymakers are looking back on what has been an extraordinary
decade: in view of the very low inﬂation, the monetary policy stance was initially very
loose, with years of zero interest rate policy and extensive asset purchases. And then
policymakers had to step heavily on the brakes in response to the inﬂation shock.
This has left its mark on the central bank balance sheet. 
It will take some years before the impact on the Bundesbank’s balance sheet has faded
once and for all. Looking ahead to the long term, the Bundesbank will transfer proﬁts
to the Federal Government again in the future.
However, the most important thing is this: price stability is within reach.
I will now hand over to Sabine Mauderer. Thank you for your attention.
