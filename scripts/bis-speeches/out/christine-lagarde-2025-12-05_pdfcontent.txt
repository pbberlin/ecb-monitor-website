It is a pleasure to address this Committee for the fourth time this year.
Recent years have witnessed profound technological, geopolitical, and structural 
changes which continue to redefine our economic landscape. These shifts underscore 
not just the importance of improving Europe's resilience and competitiveness, but also 
the imperative to build lasting internal economic strength.1
In our previous hearings, we examined this shifting global environment and its 
implications for the European economy. Today, I will focus my remarks on the 
instruments in our toolkit, in line with the topic you have selected for this hearing.
Before turning to these tools, let me first outline our assessment of the euro area 
economy and our current monetary policy stance.
Outlook for the euro area and the ECB's monetary policy
The economy grew by 0.2% in the third quarter of the year, supported by robust 
domestic demand. The services sector continued to expand, boosted by tourism and a 
pick-up in digital services, as many firms stepped up efforts to modernise their IT 
infrastructures and integrate artificial intelligence into their operations. By contrast, 
manufacturing and exports were held back by higher tariffs, still-heightened uncertainty 
and a stronger euro.
Looking ahead, growth in economic activity should benefit from increased household 
spending and a resilient and more inclusive labour market – with the highest labour 
force participation rate since the start of the euro. Substantial infrastructure and defence 
spending are also expected to support economic activity. The global environment is 
likely to remain a headwind, as the impact of higher tariffs on euro area exports and 
manufacturing investment continues to unfold.
Risks to the outlook have become more balanced thanks to the EU-US trade deal 
reached over the summer, the ceasefire in the Middle East and progress in the US-
China trade negotiations. At the same time, the outlook remains uncertain – owing to a 
still volatile global trade environment, a potential deterioration in financial market 
sentiment and geopolitical tensions.
Inflation remains close to our 2% medium-term target. According to Eurostat's flash 
estimate, inflation edged up slightly to 2.2% in November, mainly due to higher services

and energy inflation. Core inflation – excluding energy and food – was constant at 
2.4%. Indicators of underlying inflation remain consistent with our 2% medium-term 
target.
The reduction in inflation towards our medium-term target has been supported by a 
gradual moderation in wage growth from its peak of 5.7% in the second quarter of 2023 
to 3.9% in the same quarter of this year. Forward-looking indicators, such as the ECB's 
wage tracker and surveys on wage expectations, point to slower wage growth over the 
remainder of the year and the first half of 2026.
We expect inflation to stay around our 2% target in the coming months. Risks to the 
outlook continue to be two-sided, while uncertainty remains higher than usual owing to 
volatile global trade policies. The next Eurosystem staff projections, to be published on 
18 December, will shed further light on the outlook for growth and inflation.
As our assessment of the inflation outlook was broadly unchanged, we decided at our 
October monetary policy meeting to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We 
continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining 
the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be 
based on our assessment of the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it, as well as 
the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. 
We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
The instruments in the ECB's toolkit
Let me now turn to the ECB's instruments.
As reconfirmed in our recent strategy assessment, we are committed to setting 
monetary policy such that inflation stabilises at our 2% target in the medium term.Our 2 
primary monetary policy instrument is the set of three key ECB interest rates. However, 
we may also employ other instruments, as appropriate, to preserve the smooth 
functioning of monetary policy transmission and provide additional accommodation 
when interest rates approach their lower bound.
Effective transmission of our monetary policy stance across the euro area is critical for 
delivering on our price stability mandate. We must therefore remain attentive to 
situations in which cross-country differences in the impact of our policy on key 
economic variables become excessive or signal that the transmission mechanism is 
impaired. To address such concerns, we have developed tools to safeguard the smooth 
transmission of our monetary policy.
I will now briefly outline three key instruments in our monetary policy toolkit: Outright 
Monetary Transactions (OMTs), the technical features of which were announced in 
August and September 2012;the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) announced 3 
in July 2022;and the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) announced 4 
in March 2020.5
Outright Monetary Transactions are designed to safeguard the transmission of 
monetary policy in all euro area countries. OMTs enable us to address severe 

3/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
distortions in government bond markets which originate from, in particular, unfounded 
fears among investors of the reversibility of the euro. A necessary condition for OMTs is 
strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Stability 
Mechanism programme.6
The Transmission Protection Instrument can be activated to counter unwarranted, 
disorderly dynamics in the market for securities issued in countries experiencing a 
deterioration in financing conditions not warranted by country-specific fundamentals. 
The Governing Council will consider a cumulative list of criteria to assess whether the 
countries in which the Eurosystem may conduct purchases under TPI are pursuing 
sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. The criteria include, among 
others, compliance with the EU's fiscal framework and an absence of severe 
macroeconomic imbalances.
The pandemic emergency purchase programme was launched and used in response to 
the COVID-19 shock, which affected all euro area countries, but to different degrees. 
The programme was designed with a dual role: on the one hand, it supported market 
functioning as well as the transmission of monetary policy; on the other hand, it enabled 
a substantial easing of the monetary policy stance to counter the serious downside risks 
to price stability posed by the pandemic.
In the face of the extraordinary economic and financial shock, the programme's 
flexibility – which allowed the pace and composition of purchases to be adjusted – 
proved critical in stabilising markets, addressing impediments to transmission, 
supporting the economic recovery and safeguarding price stability.As circumstances 7 
evolved, the size and pace of the PEPP were recalibrated, and reinvestments of 
maturing bonds were fully discontinued as of December 2024, contributing to the 
normalisation of our balance sheet.8
Together, these tools demonstrate that the ECB's toolkit is adaptable to unprecedented 
challenges while remaining clearly within the scope of our monetary policy competence. 
Consistent with our commitment to transparency and accountability, we have engaged 
extensively with this Committee to explain our assessments and answer questions on 
these tools. This ongoing dialogue underscores our dedication to ensuring that our 
actions are thoroughly scrutinised and clearly understood by the public.
Conclusion
To conclude – as also highlighted in our monetary policy strategy statement, the 
Governing Council will continue to respond flexibly to new challenges as they arise and 
will consider, as needed, new policy instruments in the pursuit of its price stability 
objective.
It is essential that other policies take the lead in strengthening Europe's prospects and 
reducing vulnerability to future shocks. This means creating the right conditions for 
Europe's sources of economic strength to reach their full potential – most notably by 
making the Single Market truly single.

4/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
In this context, I warmly welcome the European Commission's forthcoming package on 
capital market integration and supervision. These proposals are key for overcoming 
fragmentation, enhancing the efficiency of capital markets, and fostering innovation.
There are clear solutions at hand – now is the time to implement them.
