1/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
François Villeroy de Galhau: Some thoughts about monetary policy, 
the year to come, and the past ten years
Speech by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, at the 25th 
Anniversary of the Euro50 Group event at the Bank of France, Paris, 28 November 
2024.
* * *
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to be in such good company to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the 
Euro 50 Group. I would like to warmly thank Edmond Alphandéry for being – supported 
by the late Alexandre Lamfalussy – the father, and still active Chair, of this so pleasant 
child. Euro 50 is as old – or rather as young – as the euro itself. Let me start by 
expressing a great satisfaction, which may be the best present for this anniversary: the 
euro is a hugely popular success. 78% of euro area citizens and 74% of French citizens 
support our single currency  – even more than the 68% at the start. Since its i
introduction in 1999, the euro has become the second most important currency  in the ii
international monetary system – and the ECB one of the most influential central banks 
in the world. Yet, getting stronger throughout the challenging crises of the 21century st 
has not always been plain sailing, and won't be in the next future. Today, I would like to 
focus briefly about where we are and where we could be heading in the near future (I), 
before coming back to the past ten years and what we learned on our unconventional 
toolkit (II).
I. Where we are today, and where we could go in the year to come.
In the euro area, inflation reached its peak at 10.6% in October 2022 and exceeded 4% 
for two years. But it receded quickly, and stood at 2.0% in October 2024. Beyond the 
likely ups and downs in the coming monthly data due to base effects, victory against 
inflation is in sight. The situation has however changed compared to the last months; so 
has the balance of risks. As you know, the ECB has no dual mandate; yet, our price 
stability primary objective is , around the 2% target. In the euro area, inflation  symmetric
persistence is no longer the only risk. There is equally the opposite risk that inflation 
undershoots, especially if growth remains subpar. According to the latest actual inflation 
data, the euro area could be sustainably at 2% inflation already early 2025. The 
European economy is achieving a soft landing, but a take-off is not yet in sight. Hence 
we will continue cutting rates, but let me try to put some lights on the way forward.
Which communication about the direction of the journey?
Communication about future policy is sometimes viewed as binary, while, in practice, it 
belongs to a continuum ranging from full commitment to total silence.
On one end of the spectrum, forward guidance worked rather well in the lowflation 
period. However, past experience tells us that central bankers should not be 
unconditionally pre-committed, at least beyond a few quarters. On shorter horizons, 
date-contingent forward guidance might still be valid. On longer horizons, if needed,iii

(and hence more humble) forward guidance would be more state-dependent 
appropriate.
On the other end of the spectrum, the central bank can give no indications whatsoever. 
With the recent inflation surge, the ECB shifted to a meeting-by-meeting and data-
driven approach, an evolution warranted by high uncertainty and inflation forecast 
instability. This is still where our last monetary policy statement is, but now that we are 
getting back to a more "normal" inflation regime, our communication could become 
more "forward-looking". 
Between these two ends of the spectrum, could hence be now our  soft signaling 
appropriate communication mode. By making clearer its reaction function, the central 
bank can usefully influence market expectations of future policy. When Christine 
Lagarde said "the direction of travel is clear and what we have done starting in June iv 
is the sensible approach and should be continued", this is a good example of soft 
signaling. I believe that we could now adapt our language in this direction.
Till which destination?
On our terminal rate, it is obviously too early to tell. However as we should be in the 
near future sustainably at 2% inflation, and with still a sluggish growth outlook in 
Europe, there won't be any reasons in my view for our monetary policy to remain 
restrictive : our interest rates should clearly go to the neutral rate R*. However, this 
raises two questions:
Where is precisely R*? We don't know with enough certainty but most estimates 
from the ECB and the Banque de France give a reasonable confidence range 
between 2% and 2.5% . In other words, at 3.25% we still have a significant room 
to remove the restrictive stance of our monetary policy.
Should we go further, R*? I wouldn't exclude it in the future, if growth were  below 
to remain subdued and inflation at risk of falling below target. 
But as a pragmatist, let me stress that these two questions are not urgent: the first part 
of the journey till the "confidence zone" of R* is clear and still significant; we will then 
have time and additional data to adjust for the second part. And this brings me to the 
of this first part.pace 
Which pace to remove the restrictive bias?  
The name of the game here is and remains full optionality, combining the two 
dimensions of pace which are the of rate cuts and their. We'll discuss in  frequency   size
each of our next meetings, and look at data – be they actual or forecasts. That said, let 
me give two indications:
Seen from today, there is every reason to cut on December 12. Optionality th
should remain open on the of the cut, depending on incoming data, economic  size 
projections and our risk assessment. 
Optionality also means that, for the following meetings, we shouldn't exclude any 
of them for possible cuts. Stating so the obvious, I don't mean to precommit to cut 
"back to back" in each of these meetings: this would be a renewed and excessive

Forward Guidance. We should stick, as we did in October, to what I call an "agile 
pragmatism", data driven but not timid. 
II. Some thoughts about our unconventional toolkit
Looking back now to the last 10 years, let me turn to some personal reflections on the 
two broad sets of "non-conventional" instruments. It will be a focus of our next Strategy 
Review. By the way, we should avoid the possible trap of the "immediate weather 
forecast". In the previous 2021 Review, we were just exiting the period of lowflation and 
even the risk of Covid deflation, and we were unconditionally positive about our non-
conventional tools: "[The] assessment [conducted as part of the Strategic Review] vi 
found that each of the instruments (including negative interest rates, forward guidance, 
asset purchases and longer-term refinancing operations) has been effective in raising 
output, employment and inflation, and that the different instruments have reinforced 
each other." Let us be careful not to make a symmetrical one-sided assessment today: 
as we are exiting an inflationary episode, some might be tempted to regard 
unconventional tools as useless or counterproductive. This is not the case, and I will 
discuss fine tuning them rather than calling them into question.
Balance-sheet tools 
Central bank balance-sheet tools, like asset purchase programmes and LTROs were 
designed in crisis times when conventional tools were unavailable due to the Effective 
Lower Bound. We should primarily better distinguish their objectives: either to preserve 
an effective monetary policy when specific market segments were under  transmission 
strain (equivalent to purpose), or to provide additional policy space  financial stability 
when required (i.e. monetary purpose).  And let me accordingly suggest five  stance 
lessons:
First, when it is about , there is no reason to  transmission or financial stability
hold the purchased assets in the balance sheet till maturity. This was the case of 
the BoE's purchases in the Gilts crisis in September 2022, or could be for the TPI 
(Transmission Protection Instrument) of the ECB. There is no obligation to re-sell 
at short notice – if so, the central bank would be under market dominance, and its 
intervention less effective –; but there is an option open at any time.
Second, when it is about further easing the monetary, we should  stance
distinguish whether we aim to provide liquidity (i.e. volumes) or to reduce long 
term rates (i.e. prices). When the primary objective is to inject, it should liquidity 
be done not through purchases of long-term bonds, but by lending short term or at 
floating rates for LTROs. These were by the way a powerful and successful 
innovation of the ECB, not used in the US. But the initial pricing of TLTRO III at 
quasi-fixed rates had been a mistake, which had to be later recalibrated.
That leaves " – for the core QE" – purchasing and holding long-term bonds 
purpose of reducing the term premium and therefore the long term yields. It 
entails taking interest rate risk in central banks' balance sheet, and hence 
possible losses as we have seen recently: we should however,the purpose is  if 
clear and warranted, be ready to accept such risks, while looking more closely at 
the average maturity of the purchased portfolio. Let me stress, on a positive note,

that the exit of QE – quantitative tightening (QT) – has been proceeding smoothly 
in the recent past, without provoking a reverse rise in long-term yields contrary to 
what many had feared.
In our portfolio holdings, we should prioritize government and supranational 
to limit our direct balance sheet exposure to the nonfinancial corporate bonds  
sector. That being said, such programmes are not and should never be designed 
to fund governments nor to help fiscal stimulus.
Fifth and finally, we should not condition one instrument on another. Doing so 
creates communication issues if one programme has to be stopped. For instance, 
using asset purchases to make forward guidance more credible can turn out to be 
unwise, as we saw early 2022 when we had to gradually stop asset purchases 
before being able to raise rates.
Negative interest rates
Negative interest rate policy, which prevailed until July 2022, remained the most 
puzzling and mysterious unconventional tool for public opinion. General wisdom thinks 
that nominal interest rates should always be positive. From a political economy 
standpoint, a situation where borrowing money has no cost and can even bring a 
retribution may create psychological distortions and wrong incentives, including on 
fiscal discipline.
That said, the economic impact of such a policy is still debated but seems mostly 
positive. Some ECB policy measures – like tiering – helped mitigate its potential 
adverse side-effects on bank profitability and hence on the supply of loans. Overall, 
negative interest rates should remain in our toolkit but for exceptional circumstances. 
We should therefore act forcefully to avoid being dragged into negative territory, 
another reason not to tolerate a persistent undershooting of inflation. 
I will conclude by quoting Isaac Newton, who, acknowledging the contribution of his 
predecessors, stated "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants".
Today, as central bankers, we stand on the legacy of the collective efforts, creativity vii 
and credibility of the past 25 years. It was the great privilege in particular of our 
Governing Council to be chaired successively by Wim Duisenberg, Jean-Claude 
Trichet, Mario Draghi, and now for the second time by a French President with Christine 
Lagarde. Rest assured that as grateful heirs, we'll remain a solid anchor in the 
uncertain times which lie ahead. Thank you for your attention.
