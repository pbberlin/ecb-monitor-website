Ladies and Gentlemen,
| am honored to speak before you today in New York at the Bloomberg Global
Regulatory Forum. | will soeak here as a European, and as a friend of America.
Let us acknowledge that maintaining this dual identity has come under
significant strain over the past year: you are well aware that the institutional,
geopolitical and economic shifts introduced by the new US administration are
prompting serious questions among the friends of America worldwide — and not
only in Europe. | am aware that what is perceived as Europe’s persistent
economic lag raises doubts here in the United States. So, | will begin by giving
some insights about Europe’s economic awakening which is — although too slow
— underway (I). Then, | will explore how a stronger Europe could preserve a
fruitful dialogue with the United States based on some focused and shared long-
term interests (II) — and here | will come to the subject of financial regulation as
addressed by this morning’s session.
I. Europe’s economic awakening is gradually taking shape
71. Europe’s underestimated strengths
On this side of the Atlantic, Europe is sometimes described as a declining
economic partner, slow to react and short on momentum. True, Europe is
lagging behind in terms of economic dynamism: over the last 25 years, GDP per
capita has increased by a cumulative 31% in the euro area — not that bad, but
much lower than 47% in the United States. The main cause for this is
“Schumpeterian’” — an innovation gap — as highlighted by the French economist
Philippe Aghion, co-recipient yesterday of the 2025 Nobel Prize in Economics;
as you can see, French and European people can be Schumpeterian! Beyond
that, Europe has smaller financial firepower, even though its single market is
fairly similar in size to the United States. However, Europe does not lack
savings: the euro area household saving ratio is more than 15% of gross
disposable income, which is 4 points higher than in the United States (11%).
The challenge concerns the allocation of these savings: the euro area lacks


Page 2 sur8
equity capital, which is vital to enable firms to innovate due to the higher
associated risk. Non-financial corporation (NFC) equity financing amounts to
just 85% of GDP in the euro area, compared with 220% of GDP in the United
States.

Europe does not lack investment either: as a share of GDP, total investment in
the euro area is almost the same as in the United States. But productive
investment and, above all, innovative investment are significantly lower in the
euro area.

We have the domestic resources — talents, private money, and the largest single
market [on par with the United States]. But we need to mobilize them...and the
recent US shifts are — if anything positive — a powerful wake-up call.
2. Europe’s awakening is taking shape
Let me first remind you of a major European achievement. Over the past 26
years, Europe has built its monetary sovereignty through the euro — which has


Page 3 sur8
become a huge popular success. The public support for our currency among
European citizens is at a historic high, reaching 83%'. Our monetary policy path
is also clearer: for the first time in years, we have returned to the favorable “2-
2” zone". Inflation in the euro area is close to our 2% target and our key interest
rate has stood at 2% since June 2025 — significantly lower than in the United
States or United Kingdom.
We must complement this by securing Europe’s economic and financial
sovereignty. We Europeans have a clear roadmap — outlined in the Draghi""
and Letta’’ reports. Since the beginning of 2025, the Commission has launched
fond 9
a series of initiatives around three imperatives, which | call the three “i's”.

BLOOMBERG GLOBAL REGULATORY FORUM:14 OCTOBER 2025 | BANQUE DE FRANCE
First, we must integrate the single market more, including the creation of an
optional 28" regime, that could reduce the administrative burden for businesses
cross-border, and particularly the “cost of failure’”. Second, we need to invest
better. | welcome the March 2025 Savings and Investments Union (SIU) Action
Plan“' to channel more of our abundant private savings into European equity
financing and venture capital. Third, we need to innovate faster, and the
Commission has therefore presented several “Omnibus” simplification
packages.
True, we still need a comprehensive package and a mobilizing deadline’", as
Jacques Delors did in the past with 1 January 1993 for the single market, and 1
January 1999 for the single currency. True, progress takes time, partly due to
the necessary dialogue with the European Parliament. But this belongs to


Page 4 sur8
democracy, which we strongly believe in, and Europe has often managed to
deliver the right policy framework faster on several key issues such as crypto-
asset regulation with the MiCA regulation”, ahead of GENIUS.
ll. Despite their recent divergence on trade, Europe and the United States
should still seek pragmatic areas of convergence.
71. Our recent transatlantic divergence
When we disagree across the Atlantic, we should express it clearly: this is a
prerequisite for fair dialogue. We cannot ignore the serious disagreements
between European and US political authorities on geopolitics and
multilateralism. Let me focus here on the economic divergences, and particularly
on trade. The protectionist measures adopted by the United States —
unprecedented since the 1930s — alongside persistently high unpredictability,
represent a negative shock for the global economy, including the American
economy itself. In the short term, tariffs do offer a sizeable source of fiscal
revenues. But they will not solve the problem of US “twin deficits”. The tariff
burden is already primarily borne by US importing firms and in a lesser extent
US consumers, and this will eventually weaken economic activity and increase
inflation, which is expected to accelerate by the end of the year. What is bad
news for the United States is also bad news for Europe. The impact on euro
area inflation, however, should remain negligible as the European Union did not
retaliate. Let me state the obvious: international trade is not a zero-sum game",
where one party's gain necessarily comes at the expense of another. On the
contrary, it remains the most effective way to grow together by exchanging
goods and services, ideas, talent and innovation”.
2. This should not prevent us from seeking pragmatic areas of convergence
But our transatlantic dialogue cannot be limited to our divergences. We must
seek pragmatic areas of convergence through the G7 and the G20, respectively
chaired next year by France and the United States, through the IMF where| will
be tomorrow, and through the Financial Stability Board (FSB). Let me highlight


Page 5 sur8
pragmatically at least three global issues, where our mutual interests could be
aligned.
Financial stability
| shall begin with financial stability — a global public good, given the cross-border
nature of the financial system. | strongly wish we can all stick to the agreed
international framework of Basel Ill for banks and more broadly to the Financial
Stability Board (FSB) recommendations. Let us focus on two of the many
challenges ahead.
First, the fight against financial crime. Europe and the United States should
continue to lead by example by strengthening their AML/CFT frameworks and
actively encouraging other countries to support the recent G7 “Financial Crime
Call to Action”*". We should also be vigilant there about the misuse and abuse
of cryptos.
Another shared challenge is non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI*') which
remains too opaque, highly interconnected, and, in some cases, excessively
leveraged",

Hedge funds, whose use of leverage is rising both in Europe and the United
States, now account for more than 50% of transactions in the secondary
European government debt market. These funds operate mostly across
borders, making oversight difficult and requiring strong international cooperation
to gauge their risks. The rapid growth in private credit — which is transforming
the corporate loans market in the United States and expanding in Europe*’ -,


Page 6 sur 8
is another concern. Although the market is still modest relative to the banking
sector, its complex and opaque interconnections with the broader financial
system require close coordination to monitor emerging risks.
And if we make progress together in these fields, we could come back to the
issue of climate-related risks, or “extreme weather events”. To say the least,
climate change is not taking a gap year, while we know this is at present another
transatlantic disagreement.
Technological innovation and disruptions in finance
Technological disruptions in finance are a second issue. One major innovation
is the tokenization of financial assets, which carries a dual promise: improving
efficiency in asset transfers, and bridging the gap between savings channels
and the financing needs of the real economy. But the rise of private stablecoins,
which could reach a market capitalization of between USD 500 billion and 2
trillion by 2028”, presents two significant challenges: traditional financial actors
could be displaced by new technology players, whether in terms of settlement
assets or infrastructures; and it could undermine the current balance between
central bank money and commercial bank money, posing a potential threat to
monetary sovereignty — still more for non-dollar currencies, but also in the United
States in the long run. Our Eurosystem’s response to these innovations is based
on three componentsTM': central bank digital currency, the possibility of a
tokenized commercial bank money and regulation. | welcome the fact that US
authorities have also begun addressing this issue through the recent GENIUS
Act. While our approaches may sometimes differ, continued regulatory
cooperation and support for interoperable settlement assets are essential to fully
harness the potential of the tokenization revolution.
Public debt and aging
The third global issue is that of public debt and aging. A Frenchman is certainly
not in a position to give lessons on this matter at the moment — even though
the Banque de France consistently and strongly advocates for public deficit


Page 7 sur 8
reduction, including a significant step in 2026. But | can point out that
unfortunately this is a common challenge for most advanced economies. Public
debt exceeds 120% of GDP in the United States, and stands at around 90% in
the euro area*“" — but is above 100% in many countries.

Obviously this is a long-term and cross-generational issue: fiscal policy must
first stabilize and then diminish the debt burden. In this context, there is a shared
interest in tackling international tax evasion and avoidance, and _ in
benchmarking the most efficient solutions in terms of quality and cost across
various sectors, from education to healthcare. Furthermore, public deficits are
partly responsible for global imbalances, in parallel with insufficient investment
in some jurisdictions and specific practices in some countries like China. Rather
than opposing these two explanations, let us acknowledge that both of them are
valid, and make progress in the transatlantic dialogue till next year — with the
G20 US Presidency, and the G7 French Presidency. Only with greater fiscal
efficiency will we be able to finance investments in the structural needs of our
economies such as demographic aging, defense spending, and — yes — climate
transition.
Let me conclude with the words of President George Washington: “True
friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks
of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation’. While Europe and the


Page 8 sur 8
United States may today face real divergences, they still share deep and long-
term interests that call for a demanding but pragmatic dialogue. In parallel,
Europe now has the means to strengthen its economic and financial
sovereignty, and to become an even more vigorous partner to the United States.
Thank you for your attention.
