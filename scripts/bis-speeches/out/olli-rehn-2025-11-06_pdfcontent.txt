Dear Trilateral Colleagues, Dear Friends,
Bästa nordiska vänner,
Varmt välkomna till Finland och Finlands Bank!
May I first wish you a very warm welcome to the Bank of Finland! It is a pleasure  and 
an honour  to host this Nordic evening of the Trilateral Commission, which exists for 
one very simple reason: to help liberal democracies on three continents talk to each 
other.
Our theme tonight and tomorrow is as practical as it is ambitious: What can the Nordic

participants, and the many helping hands  seen and unseen  who made this gathering 
possible.
As we Finns say, good planning means the job is half done already. This evening, the 
other half of the job is, I trust, an enjoyable dinner in good company.
Following my welcoming words, I give the floor to Dr. Iikka Korhonen, Head of BOFIT, 
The Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economies. He will provide us with a state-
of-the-art analysis on "Geopolitics, the Global Economy, China and Russia", followed by 
a Q&A.
Let me first set the table with a few historical details.
The Bank of Finland was founded in, which makes us the fourth oldest central  1811
bank in the world. We also think we have a certain claim the oldest central bank, the 
Riksbank, because when it started its operations in, Finland was still an integral  1668
part of Sweden.
The Bank of Finland, in the newly created Grand Duchy under Russian rule, from 1809 
until 1917, was founded by Tsar Alexander I, who had two aims: to strengthen the 
Finnish economy and to loosen our monetary ties with Sweden.
The Russian rouble, however, was no model of stability. It was badly shaken by the 
Crimean War of 18531856. So, on the Bank of Finland's proposal, Finland introduced 
the , the Finnish mark, in, linking it torather than the rouble. It was  markka  1860  silver

This is, of course, a sovereign matter of the Danish and Swedish people and

undeniable relevance.

Let's face it, alone we are small players, but together we would punch above our weight 
in the Eurosystem, and in the wider EU.
I often say to my colleagues, Erik and Christian: "I miss you guys! I miss you on the 
table at the ECB Governing Council."
On that note, I shall finish. Enjoy the evening  and skål på den saken!
