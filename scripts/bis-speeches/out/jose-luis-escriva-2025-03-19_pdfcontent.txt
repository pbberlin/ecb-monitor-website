1/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
José Luis Escrivá: Challenges and opportunities for the financial 
future of Europe
Speech by Mr José Luis Escrivá, Governor of the Bank of Spain, at a meeting of the 
Spanish Banking Association, Madrid, 14 March 2025.  
* * *
Good morning everyone.
I would like to begin by offering my heartfelt thanks to the Spanish Banking Association 
and in particular to its Chair, Alejandra Kindelán, for kindly inviting me to this event. I 
would also like to acknowledge the insightful speech by Commissioner Maria Luís 
Albuquerque, whose sentiments I share entirely.
We live in a time of profound change. The reshaping of the geopolitical landscape – 
marked by growing tensions between the United States and China, the protracted 
impact of the war in Ukraine and global trade fragmentation – is generating a climate of 
uncertainty that demands a clear and resolute response from Europe.
Against this backdrop, Europe cannot afford the luxury of hesitation. This is not the time 
for fragmentation or paralysis. On the contrary, it is the time for unity across all 
domains, but very particularly in the economic and financial realm. In the face of 
external uncertainty, Europe must negotiate and act from a position of power and 
embrace its relative strengths, with robust institutions and a financial market equipped 
to foster growth and stability.
With this overall picture in mind, I would first like to emphasise that our currency, the 
euro, must become a key driver of economic sovereignty, especially when other regions 
make unpredictable decisions that could generate significant disruptions in areas such 
as banking supervision, payment systems and trade policy.
Against this deeply complex geopolitical backdrop, Europe needs concrete initiatives to 
strengthen its strategic position. One area where this is particularly evident is in 
payments, through the role played by the central digital bank currency in both the retail 
and wholesale realms.
We are clearly on an irreversible trend towards increasingly digital money, incorporating 
new technologies such as tokenisation. We must ensure that money's essential 
attributes are not lost along the way, such as the assurance and security provided by 
the central bank's backing, its issuance here in Europe and its distribution by institutions 
under our supervision.
On the retail side, we have made significant progress since the inception of the euro 
and the creation of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), particularly in transfers and 
direct debits. However, in electronic payments at the point of sale, whether physical or 
digital, we continue to lag behind. We lack truly European solutions. 72% of card

payments in Europe rely on international networks, leaving us highly dependent on non-
European actors. This model comes at a growing cost: fees are estimated to have 
increased by around 35% in the last eight years.
This situation has been compounded by the emergence of new players, such as digital 
wallet providers, which have further narrowed margins. Apple Pay, for instance, 
charges 0.15% per transaction. And an even greater challenge is looming: the possible 
expansion of dollar-denominated stablecoins, a model actively backed by the current 
US Administration, which could deepen our dependence on foreign big tech firms. 
Although private initiatives such as EuroPA and Wero have sought to address these 
challenges, their reach remains insufficient. 
It is in this context that the Eurosystem is developing the digital euro, which aspires to 
complement cash and provide a foundation for and impetus to private initiatives.
We are aware of the banking sector's concerns regarding balance limits and adaptation 
costs. However, in this challenging geopolitical context the digital euro should be 
regarded not as a problem but as a solution.
This is a historic opportunity to fully complete the Single European Payments Area, 
lessen our external reliance in a critical sector and retain income from commercial 
payments within Europe. It will also ensure that we are better equipped to address 
future risks, such as the rapid expansion of dollar-denominated stablecoins.
On the wholesale front, for some years the central bank digital currency has played a 
crucial role through TARGET infrastructure. Now the challenge is to adapt these 
systems to recent technological advancements. Asset tokenisation and the use of 
distributed ledger technology (DLT) offer potential benefits in terms of efficiency, 
transparency and security. We in the Eurosystem are already working on concrete 
solutions to ensure interoperability between DLT-based private platforms and TARGET 
services.
This same strategic approach should guide the review of our regulatory framework. In 
recent decades, regulators and supervisors have worked, in collaboration with the 
banking sector, to address the structural weaknesses brought to light by the 2007 
financial crisis.
As a result of the initial Basel III reforms, which were implemented in Europe in 2013, 
today the European banking system is clearly more resilient. According to the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision, on the latest data available, since 2011 the 
average CET1 ratio has risen from 6.4% to 14.5%, while the leverage ratio has 
increased from 2.7% to 5%. The liquidity indicators (LCR and NSFR) are also 1
comfortably above the required minimum of 100%.
Notwithstanding the monetary policy measures taken by central banks or the actions 
taken by governments, this greater resilience of European banks has been evidenced 
by their ability to smoothly overcome recent crises, including exogenous ones, such as 
the pandemic. Moreover, implementation of the 2017 Basel reforms continues to build 
up financial stability.

3/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Europe's firm commitment to Basel III is all the more important in the current setting, 
and I hope it helps the jurisdictions still tackling the implementation process to take the 
steps necessary.
But we must not be complacent. Financial stability calls for a sound and solvent 
financial sector and for a regulatory and supervisory framework that is more simple, 
stable, predictable and efficient.
There is growing consensus about excessive regulatory complexity in Europe, which 
not only hampers financial institutions' operations, but also overloads the supervisory 
function and could fragment the market. This is why a holistic review and streamlining 
of our regulatory and supervisory framework is essential. I am not talking here about 
deregulation, as we are not seeking to lower requirements or remove the regulations 
that ensure the system's stability. Rather, the aim is to simplify the regulations overall, 
to make them more effective.
We must consider European regulations as a whole, including level 2 and 3 standards, 
to avoid overlaps and unnecessary complexity. We also need to analyse whether 
regulatory zeal in level 3 may, in some instances, have gone beyond the intentions of 
the legislator, and to take measures if necessary.
The current economic setting reinforces the need for these measures. Europe 
continues to grow, but it does so with a worrying structural weakness: a historical gap in 
private investment. In the euro area, productive private investment accounts for 12.3% 
of GDP, compared with 15% in the United States and 27% in China.
To bridge this gap, Europe must drive an ambitious structural agenda. One priority is to 
further European integration through policies that strengthen the Single Market, which 
will enable European firms to scale up and compete globally. Deepening the Single 
Market calls for simplifying the regulatory and fiscal frameworks, by reducing 
fragmentation and red tape. Another priority is strengthening coordination between 
national industrial policies and European public investment programmes. Public 
investment must act as a catalyst for private investment, within the bounds of a State 
aid governance framework that preserves the functioning of the Single Market.
The banking sector continues to be an essential cornerstone in this process. To finance 
these significant investment needs, firms will continue to resort largely to external 
source of financing. And the European economy is still heavily banked.
At present, bank loans account for 92% of European firms' total indebtedness, which 
means that mobilising bank lending will be essential to bridge the private investment 
gap.
In this regard, the pivotal role played by European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy 
should be highlighted.
In response to the inflationary surge in 2021-2022, the ECB raised its interest rates by 
450 basis points (bp) between July 2022 and September 2023. This tightening cycle 
was unprecedented in terms of both the pace and the scale of the policy interest rate 
hikes.

4/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
This decisive monetary policy action prevented the deanchoring of inflation 
expectations and mitigated potential second-round effects. Euro area inflation was thus 
swiftly brought down and is now close to the medium-term target of 2%.
This situation paved the way for a normalisation of monetary policy, with a cumulative 
cut of 150 bp in the deposit facility rate since June 2024. The policy interest rate cuts 
have gradually passed through to bank financing costs for firms.
Between October 2023 and January 2025 the average interest rate on new lending to 
euro area firms decreased by 1.1 percentage points (pp), to 4.1%.
This reduction in the cost of financing spurs business investment by boosting loan 
demand. Indeed, in January 2025 the stock of bank loans to euro area firms saw 2% 
growth in year- on-year terms, compared with a 0.2% decline in October 2023.
In the current geopolitical environment, I would like to mention Europe's commitment to 
strengthening its defence capabilities. This commitment poses major challenges from 
the standpoint of both public and private financing. On the public financing front, 
reaching the proposed military spending targets will require significant additional fiscal 
efforts. On the private side, bank lending to the defence sector is at very low levels. In 
Spain, for example, credit specifically earmarked for armament and ammunition 
manufacturing has not exceeded 0.1% of total bank lending at any point in the last two 
decades.
Like other long-term investments, this type of investment is characterised by high levels 
of uncertainty, strict regulatory requirements and long technological development 
cycles. Against this backdrop, it is important to assess whether the current regulatory 
and supervisory framework provides the proper incentives to mobilise bank financing 
towards this type of investment, and to analyse how the banking sector could play a 
more active role in this strategic area.
However, bank credit alone cannot meet all the financing needs. The specific 
characteristics of the banking business, which is subject to stringent prudential 
regulations that were strengthened after the 2008 financial crisis, make it difficult for 
financial institutions to provide financing for very long-term projects, particularly risky or 
highly uncertain ones. Since the global financial crisis, European firms have slightly 
increased their non-bank financing by issuing debt securities, whose share in the stock 
of corporate debt has risen from 4.4% in 2008 to 8.1% in 2024. However, this figure 
remains much lower than in the United States, where this type of financing accounts for 
39.3% of the total.
This is precisely why Europe needs to foster deeper and more integrated capital 
markets. Capital risk is crucial for financing innovative projects and strategic sectors, 
such as technology or the energy transition. However, European early-stage investment 
markets are six times smaller than those of the United States and they are concentrated 
in a handful of countries, such as Germany, France and Sweden. In this connection, the 
Swedish experience is particularly illustrative. Sweden has managed to develop the 
EU's deepest capital market, with a stock market capitalisation volume equivalent to 
170% of its GDP, well above the average 60% for the EU or 40% for Spain. A key 
factor for this success was the integration of its stock market into Nasdaq-Europe, a

regional platform operating markets in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland. By 
using a dual model which combines a main market with a more flexible growth segment 
(Nasdaq First North Growth Market), Sweden has helped startups and SMES gain 
access to government funding, recording the highest number of new admissions to 
trading in the entire continent in recent years. This experience shows that, in addition to 
EU reforms under the Capital Markets Union (CMU) framework, there is room for 
strengthening the capital markets at national level.
Venture capital should be a priority in Europe. Public capital plays a key role in the early 
stages of innovation. For it to work effectively, it is necessary to develop agile 
investment instruments that can accurately assess projects' financial and technological 
aspects, harnessing the potential of European funds for co-investment and attracting 
private capital. These instruments must be accompanied by measures to reduce 
regulatory barriers and facilitate private capital participation. Additionally, fostering an 
ecosystem in which venture capital funds have clear incentives to leverage the 
opportunities arising from public support is essential.
This is why the CMU is an essential cornerstone of Europe's financial future. We must 
avoid the errors of previous initiatives and adopt a pragmatic approach, with clear 
objectives and efficient measures. The Banco de España strongly supports the Savings 
and Investment Union (SIU), a European initiative combining the complementary 
objectives of the CMU and the banking union. We are fully aligned with Commissioner 
Albuquerque's view of the importance of this complementarity.
One of the most urgent aspects within the SIU is the revival of the securitisation market.
Securitisation allows banks to transfer credit risk off their balance sheets towards non-
bank investors, releasing capital for new loans. However, it is underdeveloped in 
Europe. In 2022 the volume of securitisations issued in Europe was 0.3% of GDP, 
compared with 4% in the United States. Although there are particularities in both 2
markets – such as the role of government mortgage agencies in the United States or 
the importance of covered bonds in Europe – this difference is significant and calls for 
urgent action.
We believe that the reform of the European regulatory framework should focus on 
reducing its complexity, introducing greater proportionality in transparency requirements 
for originators and in due diligence obligations for investors. 
We also support the creation of a European securitisation platform to facilitate the 
issuance of standardised securitised bonds.
