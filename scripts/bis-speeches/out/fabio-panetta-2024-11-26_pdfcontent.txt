Beyond fragmentation: economic resilience in a shifting world
Opening remarks by Fabio Panetta* 
Governor of Banca d’Italia
G7-Seminar on ‘A fragmenting trading system:  
where we stand and the implications for policy’
Banca d’Italia 
Rome, 15 November 2024
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a great pleasure to welcome you to this G7-seminar on ‘A fragmenting trading 
system: where we stand and the implications for policy’. 
We are meeting today just a few hundred  metres from Palazzo dei Conservatori, where 
the Treaties of Rome were signed in 1957. The Treaties laid the foundations for the 
European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community. They set 
in motion a vision of cooperation and shared prosperity that still resonates strongly in 
the world today. Their objectives reflect a set of values that transcend European borders 
and remain strikingly relevant: to promote the free movement of people, goods, services 
and capital, and to ensure equal access to essential materials.1 
Almost 70 years later, these values are under strain. 
In my remarks today I will touch on some of the forces that risk pushing the global 
system towards fragmentation. I will also outline some high-level criteria for tackling the 
problem. 
The opening up to international trade, increased economic and financial integration, and 
closer cooperation between countries are important achievements for the international 
community after the devastation caused by the Second World War. We must safeguard 
these achievements to ensure prosperity and peace for future generations.

shall be ensured [...] by means of a common supply policy on the principle of equal access to 
sources of supply.’

There is perhaps no better way to describe the process of global integration than through 
the lens of international trade. 
The ability to trade has always brought countries together. Two centuries ago, the house 
of Thomas Jefferson, one of the American founding fathers, was filled with wine, furniture 
and books imported from Europe.2
Since then, global trade integration has increased dramatically and its centre of gravity 
has shifted. Two hundred years ago, trade was mostly an Atlantic affair. 3 Today, trade 
connects all regions across the world, and its value (imports plus exports) has reached 60 
per cent of world GDP. Two main factors have contributed to this expansion.
First, falling trade costs. Jefferson could afford to import French wine because he 
was extremely wealthy. Today, import costs are much lower – for everyone. This is 
partly because the reduction in international tariffs under the GATT/WTO multilateral 
agreements has made imported goods cheaper. Indeed, research shows that the 
increase in import tariffs in the United States in 2018 significantly raised the price 
of imported goods – tariffs were passed on one-to-one to US consumers. 4 Equally 
important is the fall in international transport costs: by some measures, air transport 
costs have fallen in real terms from almost $4 per tonne-kilometer in 1955 to $0.3 in 
2004.5 Policy certainly matters, but so does technological progress.
A second key factor is that global trade now moves through complex global value 
chains. The furniture in Jefferson’s living room was designed and manufactured entirely 
in Europe. Today, the material and intellectual inputs for both simple and complex 
objects come from all over the world. This has led to a spectacular increase in both 
the interconnectedness and specialization of global economies. Take the iPhone for 
example. It is designed in the United States, its display comes from South Korea, the 
memory chips come from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and it is all assembled  
in China.6
Globalization has been accompanied by a dramatic improvement in living standards, 
especially in China and in other parts of Asia. Hundreds of millions of people have

been lifted out of poverty. 7 This phenomenon has been so pronounced that between 
1980 and 2008 the centre of gravity of global economic activity moved some 5,000 km 
eastwards.8 This shift in trade has also been accompanied by geopolitical shifts.

For all the successes I have listed, we must acknowledge that globalization has also 
created vulnerabilities. Some have only recently become apparent. Others have been 
brewing for a long time.9 This brings me directly to the issue of global fragmentation.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the geopolitical tensions following Russia’s aggression  
against Ukraine have highlighted the vulnerabilities associated with over-reliance on 
single suppliers or regions. These events have shown how specialization can improve 
efficiency but also lead to excessive concentration, creating bottlenecks in global supply 
chains. 
Interdependence is increasingly perceived as a source of risk to national security. 
Examples include the sudden interruption of Russian gas flows to Europe, or China’s 
export quotas on gallium. At the same time, several advanced economies have curbed 
technology exports to non-aligned countries. 10 Geopolitical blocs are now considering 
how to manage specialization and international trade to ensure their supremacy in the 
race for technology. 
Companies are already taking note. 11 Geopolitical considerations are becoming more 
important in their foreign direct investment decisions. 12 In the European Union (EU), 
companies have begun to implement de-risking strategies, mainly by replacing Chinese 
suppliers with EU-based ones.13 Globalization is not over, but the geography of trade is 
changing.14 
7 At the global level, inequalities have decreased since the 1980s thanks to a reduction in the gaps 
between countries. See L. Chancel, T. Piketty, E. Saez and G. Zucman (coordinators), World Inequality 
Report 2022, World Inequality Lab, 2022.

Other forces are also pushing towards greater fragmentation. In several advanced countries, 
critics argue that – by embracing globalization – democratic countries have given up some 
of their autonomy in implementing national policies that could have offered protection to 
the most vulnerable workers and citizens.15 Such considerations deserve attention. 
At the same time, globalization has often been an easy scapegoat. For example, empirical 
analysis shows that technological progress has a much greater impact on wage inequality 
than outsourcing or participation in global value chains.16 
It has also become increasingly clear that some countries have been able to attract 
significant volumes of global production thanks to substantial public subsidies. 17 For 
example, the rapid growth of the electric vehicle industry in China has been supported 
by generous production subsidies. 18 Multilateral rules and institutions have not always 
been effective in addressing these distortions. This has contributed to the erosion of the 
multilateral system.
As a central banker, let me also comment on the state of the international financial 
system. At global level, the degree of financial integration remains high, and the financial 
safety net has expanded significantly since the 2008 financial crisis. However, this safety 
net remains uneven across countries. 19 There are signs that the landscape is changing. 
For instance, there is growing debate about the impact of trade and financial sanctions 
on the structure of the international payments system. In addition, some central banks 
are reducing their holdings of major currencies while increasing their gold reserves.20

How should we address the challenges of global fragmentation?
Recognizing that this is an extremely complex issue, I will refrain from offering a specific 
solution. Instead, I will propose a methodological approach and outline some concrete 
examples of its application.

2008 was driven mainly by increased coverage from BSAs and RFAs, which however are limited to 
selected participating countries. The IMF remains the only elements of the global financial safety net 
that provides universal coverage. See S. Aiyar et al., ‘Geoeconomic Fragmentation and the Future of 
Multilateralism’, IMF Staff Discussion Notes, 1, 2023.

My basic premise is that we must avoid the illusion that blanket measures erecting 
protectionist barriers are the solution to our problems. A blanket measure is like a kitchen 
knife: it is not the right instrument to perform complex surgery. The global economy is 
extremely complex in its trade, investment and financial interconnections. Attempts to 
divide the global economy into rival blocs would do more harm than good. 
An escalation of trade barriers between blocs would lead to severe efficiency and welfare 
losses for all. 21 It would reduce the diversification of our economies and increase the 
volatility of output and inflation. Indeed, several studies have shown that trade openness 
and participation in global production networks improve the diversification of sources 
of supply and demand, thereby reducing exposure to local shocks. 22 The weaponization 
of critical supply chains by commodity-producing countries would severely affect EU 
manufacturing production, with heterogeneous effects across regions, sectors and firms. 
For example, value-added in the electrical equipment industry could fall by more than  
7 per cent, three times as much as in the textile industry.23 
Protectionism would not be as protective as it might seem, as blunt policies would 
inevitably be circumvented. Key products targeted by bilateral trade restrictions would 
find indirect routes to opposing blocs through trade with third countries, 24 simply 
turning a bilateral relationship into a three-party trade. This would only add a third trade 
intermediary, increasing costs and risks and reducing transparency. 25 Such unintended 
consequences would undermine economic efficiency and security.

So, how can we pursue a more focused de-risking strategy?
In my view, this strategy rests on four main pillars: information, innovation, flexibility 
and international cooperation. As an example of this approach, I will refer to possible  
de-risking strategies in the sourcing of critical raw materials. This is a crucial issue for the 
EU, which accounts for only 0.5 per cent of global production of these inputs.26

are signs of a rerouting of EU sanctioned goods through specific third countries. See A. Borin et al. ,

With better information, we can better identify and monitor vulnerabilities. Many 
G7 public institutions, including the European Commission and the US Department 
of Commerce, have developed analytical tools to map critical vulnerabilities in 
the availability of raw materials. 27 However, our understanding of production 
interdependencies remains limited. More data needs to be collected and pooled, and 
best practices and tools need to be shared.
Innovation is the second pillar. Scientific research and product development can 
provide us with alternative materials and technologies. This can be financed partly 
through public-private partnerships for large projects. In addition, multilateral 
financial institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
can finance new supply chains that help diversify sources of critical raw materials. 
Third, our policies must be flexible enough to adapt to an ever-changing landscape. 
We cannot predict exactly what future innovations will look like. Nor can we predict 
geopolitical developments. Nevertheless, we should set long-term goals. Flexibility is all 
the more important when change takes time.28
The fourth pillar is cooperation. To unlock the greatest gains, we should remain 
committed to making cooperation truly global. The cost of a fragmented world would 
in fact be very high. Some research 29 suggests that it could exceed 6 percent of global 
GDP in extreme scenarios. 30 
But as global cooperation becomes more difficult, there are reasons to at least 
strengthen cooperation among like-minded countries. The rewards are great: it was 
a joint US-European supply chain that developed and distributed one of the most

Commission Staff Working Document, 352, 2021; U.S. Department of Commerce ‘Fact Sheet: 
Department of Commerce Announces New Actions on Supply Chain Resilience’, 10 September 2024.
28 To understand what this means, consider the production of critical minerals needed for the climate 
transition. Europe needs a flexible policy mix to significantly reduce its critical dependencies  
(M. Draghi, ‘The future of European competitiveness’, September 2024). Projects to increase domestic 
production of critical minerals are under way, for example for lithium. However, uncertainties remain 
regarding potential yields, especially for rare earths. There is currently no domestic refining capacity 
for these elements in the EU, so decisions will also have to be made here (L. Gregoir and K. van Acker, 
‘Metals for Clean Energy: Pathways to Solving Europe’s Raw Materials Challenge’, KU Leuven, 2022). 
Some argue that, if technological innovation in recycling advances far enough, Europe could become 
a net exporter of these minerals in the long term. But, in the short term, we need to step up economic 
diplomacy to strengthen trade and investment partnerships with a wider group of suppliers, including 
those in sub-Saharan Africa. The G7 Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Supply Chain Enhancement 
is a blueprint for innovative strategies on this front. It can help diversify our supply chains for clean 
energy products, while providing our partners in low- and middle-income countries with technology 
transfers that support their economic development.

the COVID-19 pandemic on world GDP in 2020. This impact is calculated as the difference between 
realized world GDP in 2020 and the corresponding value projected by the IMF in its October 2019 
‘World Economic Outlook’.

successful vaccines against COVID-19. The EU is already discussing new ways to further 
coordinate its members’ policies. We also need to work better with our international 
partners. For instance, we should reinvigorate discussions on trade and investment 
agreements. On industrial policy, better coordination would at least allow us to avoid 
costly subsidy wars. 
*   *   *
Let me conclude by emphasizing that the costs of international fragmentation are not 
only economic. Much more is at stake: from social progress to international cooperation. 
And so is freedom – the freedom to trade goods and services, to invest across borders, 
to share knowledge and ideas. These are the prerequisites for securing prosperity and 
peace.
I very much look forward to the discussions that will emerge from today’s seminar.  
I am sure it will help raise awareness of the many benefits that only an integrated world 
can bring.
