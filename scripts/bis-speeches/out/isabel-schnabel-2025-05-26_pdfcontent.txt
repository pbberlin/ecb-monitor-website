SPEECH
Keeping a steady hand in an unsteady world
Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the
ECB, at Hoover Monetary Policy Conference “Finishing the Job and
New Challenges”, Stanford University
Stanford, 10 May 2025
Standard theory of monetary policy rests on a simple premise: a stable relationship between inflation and
the output gap. This is the logic behind the Phillips curve, which, in its most common form, relates inflation
to a measure of economic slack, expected inflation and supply shocks.[ ]
The relationship between output and inflation was already under scrutiny well before the pandemic.
After the global financial crisis of 2008, inflation didn’t fall nearly as much as had been implied by
conventional Phillips curve estimates. And once economies around the world recovered and
unemployment fell, the bounce-back in inflation fell short of model predictions.
This is why that episode is known as the period of “missing deflation” and “missing inflation”.[ ]
The situation changed fundamentally in the aftermath of the pandemic, when the relationship between
inflation and the output gap proved to be much stronger than what would have been expected based on
historical estimates. We observed a noticeably steeper Phillips curve across advanced economies,
including the euro area (Slide 2).[ ]
In my remarks today, I would like to draw lessons from the instability of the Phillips curve over the past 20
years for the optimal conduct of monetary policy. I will argue that the evidence of a re-flattening of the
Phillips curve after the long period of high inflation suggests that, in the euro area, the most appropriate
policy response to the potential risks to price stability arising from fiscal expansion and protectionism is to
keep a steady hand and maintain rates close to where they are today – that is, firmly in neutral territory.
Monetary policy and the slope of the Phillips curve
The slope of the Phillips curve has first-order implications for the conduct of monetary policy.
If the curve is steep, as it appeared to be in recent years, monetary policy is highly effective in reducing
inflation, with only a limited impact on growth and employment. The smaller “sacrifice ratio” suggests that
central banks should react more forcefully to deviations of inflation from target, even when the economy is
hit by a supply shock that pushes inflation up and output down.[ ]
A steep Phillips curve hence improves the trade-off facing central banks, weakening the case for “looking
through”, as forceful policy action minimises the risks of inflation expectations unanchoring and of inflation

becoming entrenched.[ ]
Policy prescriptions differ fundamentally if the Phillips curve is flat.
In this case, a large policy impulse is required to move output sufficiently to generate aggregate price
effects. It can then be optimal for policy to tolerate moderate deviations of inflation from target, as the cost
of closing a small inflation gap relative to the target may exceed the benefits.
This prescription holds in both directions.
When inflation is above the target, a flat Phillips curve would require a sharp rise in policy rates to bring
medium-term inflation down from, say, 2.3% to 2%. Such a course of action may imply a substantial rise in
unemployment and may thus not be welfare-improving for society at large – a trade-off central banks may
face during the last mile of disinflation.[ ]
The experience of the 2010s, when inflation was persistently below the target, demonstrates that the
argument also holds in the opposite direction.
If bringing inflation up from 1.7% to 2%, for example, requires purchasing a large fraction of outstanding
government bonds and making potentially time-inconsistent promises about the future path of interest
rates, then the central bank must consider carefully whether the benefits outweigh the costs, such as
making losses in the future, market dysfunction, rising wealth inequality, financial instability and threats to
its reputation.[ ]
The role of inflation expectations
However, the ability to tolerate moderate deviations of inflation from target critically hinges on a firm
anchoring of inflation expectations – that is, a low sensitivity of inflation expectations to realised inflation.
If inflation expectations are well-anchored, policymakers can tolerate moderate deviations from target, as
fluctuations in inflation tend to fade away. If, however, inflation expectations are at risk of unanchoring,
central banks should act forcefully.[ ]
There are two challenges to this strategy.
One is that the anchoring of inflation expectations is endogenous. Central banks themselves can cause an
unanchoring if inaction in the face of price shocks is perceived as weakening its commitment to securing
price stability.[ ]
History shows that it can be costly to reestablish the credibility of the nominal anchor once it has been lost.
This is also because inflation expectations are path-dependent. Research shows that the experience of
high inflation may raise the sensitivity of inflation expectations to new inflation surprises.[ ]
The other challenge is that different measures of inflation expectations often yield different results (Slide
3). As such, robust trends cannot easily be identified in real time, much like the slope of the Phillips curve.

Measures of inflation expectations can even point in opposite directions. Research from the early days of
the pandemic showed that most consumers expected the pandemic to raise prices, contrary to the views
held by professional forecasters at the time.[ ]
State-dependent pricing and tight labour markets can explain steeper Phillips
curve and post-pandemic inflation surge
The recent period of high inflation illustrates how sensitive policy conclusions can be to the assessment of
the slope of the Phillips curve and to measures of inflation expectations that central banks use in their
analysis.
Two key theories have been proposed to explain the post-pandemic inflation surge.[ ]
The first relates to firms’ price-setting behaviour.
Standard New Keynesian models assume that the probability of firms resetting their prices is constant
over time. This is a fair description of aggregate price movements when inflation is low and aggregate
shocks are small (Slide 4).
However, the past few years have demonstrated that this “linear” relationship breaks down in the face of
large shocks.[ ] When marginal costs increase rapidly and threaten to erode profit margins, firms tend to
raise their prices more frequently. As a result, the Phillips curve steepens.
This feedback loop is strongly asymmetric.[ ] It acts as an inflation accelerator when firms face positive
demand or adverse cost-push shocks.[ ] But it does little to firms’ pricing strategies in the face of
disinflationary shocks due to downward price rigidities.
This helps explain why inflation did not fall much when the pandemic broke out but increased sharply after
the reopening of our economies (Slide 5).[ ]
The second theory relates to the tightness of the labour market.
Downward nominal wage rigidity has been a key factor explaining the “missing deflation” in the aftermath
of the global financial crisis.[ ] If nominal wages do not fall, or fall only very slowly, firms’ marginal costs
change only moderately, and hence disinflationary pressures face a natural lower bound, even if slack is
large.
But when the labour market is tight, wages are more flexible as firms outbid each other in securing their
desired workforce.
Benigno and Eggertsson show that this channel led to a non-linear inflation surge in the United States
whenever the number of job vacancies exceeded the number of unemployed workers (Slide 6).[ ] In the
euro area, the threshold was lower, but the curve still exhibited strong signs of non-linearity.
Rising near-term inflation expectations may have shifted the Phillips curve up

19

New research for the United States, however, suggests that the evidence in favour of the second theory is
not very robust.
Specifically, the finding of non-linearity depends critically on which measure is used to control for inflation
expectations: non-linearity holds when controlling for expectations of professional forecasters, but it
disappears once inflation expectations of households and firms are considered.[ ]
In other words, it is conceivable that the Phillips curve did not become steeper but rather shifted upwards
as inflation expectations rose.[ ] Non-linearity has also been rejected recently using a similar approach
based on regional data for the euro area.[ ]
Moreover, the expectations that are relevant for such an upward shift are not necessarily the longer-term
expectations that central banks typically pay most attention to.
These have remained remarkably stable over the past few years (Slide 7).
Rather, inflation expectations over the near term, such as the next 12 months, may be more important in
driving macroeconomic outcomes.
Bernanke and Blanchard, for example, show that one-year-ahead inflation expectations explain a
significant share of the recent marked rise in nominal wages, and hence inflation, in the United States.[ ]
Similar evidence has been found for the euro area and other advanced economies.[ ]
Again, there appears to be an asymmetry: the risks that the Phillips curve shifts downwards are
substantially lower. Research shows that consumers tend to respond more to inflationary than
disinflationary news, as households value increases in their purchasing power and as they pay less
attention to inflation when it is low.[ ]
The impact of tariffs on inflation in the euro area
Understanding the reasons behind the recent inflation surge is not only important from a conceptual
perspective. It also matters for setting monetary policy today, as we are once again confronted with
historically large shocks.
For central banks, this is a difficult environment to navigate.
Memories of high inflation are still fresh after a long period of sharply rising prices. And just as during the
pandemic, there is considerable uncertainty about how firms and households are going to respond to
shocks that are largely outside the historical empirical range.
Ultimately, the impact of current shocks on prices and wages, and hence the appropriate monetary policy
response, will depend on the shape and location of the Phillips curve.
Monetary policy should focus on the medium term and underlying inflation
Let me illustrate this by looking at the euro area.

Given the lags in policy transmission, the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term. The
past few years, however, demonstrated that inflation forecasting at times of large structural shocks is
inherently difficult and plagued by large uncertainty.
For this reason, the ECB and other central banks have increasingly turned to a data-dependent approach
to monetary policy, where the observed dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary
transmission are used to cross-check the inflation projections.[ ]
This approach remains valid today.[ ] But data dependence is not in contrast to being forward-looking.
In the current situation, the high level of economic uncertainty, together with the sharp fall in energy prices
and a stronger euro exchange rate, will likely dampen headline inflation in the short run, potentially
pushing it below our 2% target.
The question is whether these developments provide meaningful signals about the net impact of current
shocks on medium-term inflation.
During the pandemic, for example, a strong appreciation of the euro against the US dollar, by nearly 14%
over seven months, and a marked decline in energy prices were followed by a historical inflation surge.
Data dependency hence requires examining the potential channels through which current shocks could
affect underlying inflation over the medium term.
In the euro area, there are two main forces that could have the size and persistence to pull underlying
inflation sustainably away from our 2% medium-term target.
One is fiscal policy, which is set to expand on a scale unseen outside periods of deep economic
contraction.
Germany has eased its constitutional debt brake for defence-related spending, and has committed to
spending €500 billion, or more than 10% of GDP, on infrastructure and the green transition over the next
12 years. In addition, the European Commission has invited Member States to activate the national
escape clause to accommodate increased defence expenditure across the EU.
The impact of these measures on inflation will depend on how they are implemented, especially their
impact on the supply side of the economy. But on balance, the fiscal impulse is likely to put upward
pressure on underlying inflation over the medium term.
Global fragmentation is the second force that could have a lasting impact on prices and wages.
As we speak, the scale and scope of tariffs, the extent of retaliation as well as how financial markets
respond to these developments all remain highly uncertain.
Ongoing negotiations are a sign that mutually beneficial agreements may still be reached. An ideal
outcome – the “zero-for-zero” tariff agreement advocated by the European Commission – could even
boost growth and employment on both sides of the Atlantic.
However, should these negotiations fail, the euro area will simultaneously face adverse supply and
demand shocks, as the EU has announced that it will retaliate against higher tariffs.
26
27

Similar to the pandemic, assessing the relative strength of these forces is inherently difficult. Overall,
however, there are risks that a lasting and meaningful increase in tariffs will reinforce the upward pressure
on underlying inflation arising from higher fiscal spending over the medium term.
To see this, it is useful to look at the factors driving the macroeconomic propagation of tariffs.
Euro area foreign demand may prove resilient, with limited effects on inflation
The severity of the negative demand shock will depend on two factors.
One is the hit to economic activity in the United States and to global demand from raising tariffs across the
board. Under the 2 April tariff rates, the United States will face a supply shock of historic proportions.
Inflation is poised to rise, real incomes to fall and unemployment to increase. Retaliatory tariffs would
weaken the economy further.
So even in the absence of demand reallocation, foreign demand can be expected to decline if there is a
broad increase in tariffs. The depth and persistence of this decline will also depend on other policies, such
as tax and spending cuts and deregulation.
And it will crucially depend on the final outcome of tariff negotiations, which is likely to be far less severe
than the 2 April announcement.
The second factor affecting the severity of the demand shock relates to the degree of demand reallocation
– that is, the elasticity of substitution between foreign and domestic products. This elasticity is highly
uncertain and varies across industries, products and countries.[ ]
However, a robust finding in the literature is that products that are more differentiated tend to be relatively
price-inelastic, as they are more difficult to substitute.
This has great relevance for the euro area, where the bulk of exports to the United States comprise
pharmaceuticals, machinery, vehicles and chemicals. These goods are typically highly differentiated (Slide
8, left-hand side).
For instance, the supply of machines for producing semiconductors is basically monopolised by one Dutch
company. Similarly, banknotes in the United States are overwhelmingly printed using machinery from a
single German manufacturer.
These and other machines are not easy to replace in the short run, giving euro area exporters leverage to
pass higher costs on to foreign importers and limiting the hit to foreign demand.
In addition, trade diversion may benefit euro area exports.
Should prohibitive tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, they will measurably raise the euro area’s
price competitiveness in the US market. This can be expected to stimulate demand for euro area goods if
there are no alternatives in the United States itself, especially as the number of industries in which both
Chinese and euro area firms have comparative advantages has increased measurably over the past two
decades (Slide 8, right-hand side).[ ]
28
29

New research corroborates this view.[ ] It finds that the euro area stands to win in relative terms from a
global trade war, as its net exports to the world will rise rather than fall as global demand is reallocated
across the global network, offsetting the hit to domestic consumption.[ ]
In other words, for as long as tariffs are not prohibitive to trade and the uncertainty paralysing activity
fades, aggregate euro area foreign demand may prove relatively resilient under a range of potential tariff
outcomes.
The recent appreciation of the euro does not refute this view.
The euro has gone through two distinct phases since the US presidential election in November last year. It
first depreciated in nominal effective terms by 3% until mid-February, before starting to appreciate. So, in
net terms, the euro is trading just 2.6% above last year’s average.
In addition, as most exports to the United States are invoiced in US dollars, the pass-through of changes
in the exchange rate to import prices tends to be moderate – by recent estimates just about one-fifth.[ ]
And potential losses in price competitiveness in third countries are in part compensated by lower import
costs, as euro area exports have, on average, a large import content.
This price inelasticity is also reflected in recent surveys, with manufacturing firms reporting an expansion
in output for the first time in more than two years (Slide 9). Also, fewer firms are reporting falling export
orders.
Even if part of these developments may reflect frontloading by firms, it is remarkable how resilient
sentiment has remained in the face of the extraordinary increase in economic uncertainty.
Supply shock puts upward pressure on inflation, reinforced by global supply
chains
The downward effects on inflation caused by lower demand are likely to be offset, partly or even fully, by
the supply shock hitting the euro area through retaliatory tariffs imposed by the EU and other economies.
The strength of this supply shock also depends on two factors.
One is the extent to which firms pass higher tariffs on to consumers.
In the United States, evidence from the 2018 tariff increase suggests that, in most cases, the pass-through
to import prices was de facto complete.[ ] At the same time, many firms chose to absorb part of the
increase in import prices in their profit margins, thereby limiting the increase in consumer price inflation, at
least in the short run.[ ]
Whether firms will respond similarly to a renewed rise in tariffs in the current environment is uncertain.
On the one hand, the recent appreciation of the euro, if persistent, provides some margin for euro area
firms to buffer cost increases from retaliatory tariffs. On the other hand, profit margins have already been
squeezed by high wage growth and a sluggish economy, and the post-pandemic inflation surge may have
lowered the bar for firms to pass higher costs on to consumers.
30

Overall, recent surveys of companies in the United States and the euro area suggest that they plan to
gradually pass higher tariffs on to consumers over the coming years.[ ]
In addition, in order to compensate for the hit to input costs, firms also tend to raise the prices of goods not
directly affected by tariffs. There is evidence that retailers broadly adjust price markups even if only a
subset of wholesale prices change.[ ]
The second, and related, factor determining the strength of the supply shock relates to global value
chains.
Unlike during the wave of protectionism in the 1930s, today the dominant share of international trade,
about 70%, reflects multinational firms distributing production across countries and along the value chain
to minimise costs. In this process, parts and components often cross borders many times.
Prohibitive tariffs between the United States and China are already disrupting supply chains. Shipments of
goods are declining, potentially causing future shortages of critical intermediate goods that could
reverberate across the world.
While current conditions are very different from those seen during the pandemic, when supply chain
disruptions were a main factor driving the surge in inflation, the impact of tariffs is likely to be amplified as
the increase in firms’ marginal costs propagates through the production network.
ECB staff analysis shows that, even if the EU does not retaliate, higher production costs transmitted
through global value chains could more than offset the disinflationary pressure coming from lower foreign
demand, making tariffs inflationary overall (Slide 10, left-hand side).[ ]
These effects will become stronger with full retaliation, including intermediate goods. So far, the EU’s
retaliatory measures have disproportionately targeted final consumer goods, such as beverages, food and
home appliances – precisely to avoid broader cost effects being transmitted through value chains
(Slide 10, right-hand side).
But if the trade conflict intensifies, the scale of retaliation will widen and increasingly include intermediate
goods, as these account for nearly 70% of euro area imports from the United States.
In other words, retaliatory tariffs on intermediate goods would constitute a much broader cost-push shock
for euro area firms, reminiscent of the post-pandemic supply chain disruptions.[ ]
It is possible that these effects will be mitigated by China redirecting goods originally destined for the
United States towards the euro area and other economies at a discount.
In practice, however, this mitigation channel is likely to be contained. India, for example, has already
raised temporary tariffs on China to curb a surge in imports. Similarly, the European Commission has
repeatedly clarified that it intends to protect euro area firms against dumping prices should imports from
China rise significantly in response to the evolving trade conflict with the United States.[ ]
Policy implications

How, then, should the ECB respond to the current shocks?
The lessons from the post-pandemic surge in inflation suggest that, from today’s perspective, the
appropriate course of action is to keep rates close to where they are today – that is, firmly in neutral
territory.
A “steady hand” policy provides the best insurance against a wide range of potential outcomes. In other
words, it is robust to many contingencies.
Specifically, it avoids reacting excessively to volatility in headline inflation at a time when domestic inflation
remains sticky and new forces are putting upward pressure on underlying inflation over the medium term.
Given lags in policy transmission, an accommodative policy stance could amplify risks to medium-term
price stability.
This steady hand policy also avoids overreacting to concerns that tariffs may destabilise inflation
expectations once again.
In recent months, households’ short-term inflation expectations have reversed and started rising again.
According to the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey, expectations for inflation one year ahead
increased to 2.9% in March from their trough of 2.4% in September 2024 (Slide 11, left-hand side).
Qualitative inflation expectations, as measured by the European Commission, even rose to levels last
seen in late 2022 (Slide 11, right-hand side).
Currently, there are no indications that this rise is persistent, or that inflation expectations are at risk of
unanchoring.
Hence, we can afford to look through the rise in short-term inflation expectations. This could change if we
see clear signs of a strong and front-loaded pass-through of potential tariff increases – something that
could bring us back to the steep part of the Phillips curve. So far, however, evidence suggests that firms
have notably slowed the frequency with which they revise their prices.
A steady hand policy also addresses risks of a more substantial decline in aggregate demand in response
to the trade conflict.
If tight labour markets were the main culprit for the recent steepening of the Phillips curve, risks of a sharp
decline in inflation caused by a rise in unemployment are much more moderate today.
The reason for this is that in both the United States and the euro area, the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio
has fallen markedly and is now at a level that suggests that labour markets are much more balanced
(Slide 12).
We are thus likely to be operating close to, or at, the flat part of the Phillips curve where a change in
unemployment has only limited effects on underlying inflation, in stark contrast to the high inflation period.
[ ]
We would only need to react more forcefully to the tariff shock if we observed a sharp deterioration in
labour market conditions or an unanchoring of inflation expectations to the downside.
Both seem unlikely at the current juncture.
40

Despite the number of vacancies declining, the euro area labour market has proven resilient, with
unemployment at a record low. And most measures of medium-term inflation expectations remain tilted to
the upside, including those of professional forecasters (Slide 13).
Conclusion
My main message today, and with this I would like to conclude, is therefore simple: now is the time to keep
a steady hand.
In the current environment of elevated volatility, the ECB needs to remain focused on the medium term.
Given long and variable transmission lags, reacting to short-term developments could result in the peak
impact of our policy only unfolding when the current disinflationary forces have passed.
Over the medium term, risks to euro area inflation are likely tilted to the upside, reflecting both the
increase in fiscal spending and the risks of renewed cost-push shocks from tariffs propagating through
global value chains.
Therefore, from today’s perspective, an accommodative monetary policy stance would be inappropriate,
also because recent inflation data suggest that past shocks may unwind more slowly than previously
anticipated.
By keeping interest rates near their current levels, we can be confident that monetary policy is neither
excessively holding back growth and employment, nor stimulating it. We are thus in a good place to
evaluate the likely future evolution of the economy and to take action if risks materialise that threaten price
stability.
Thank you.

it to take about two years for the increase in tariffs to be fully passed through to consumers. See Andrade,
P. et al. (2025), “

Reserve Bank of Dallas found that 76% of manufacturing firms intend to pass cost increases from higher
tariffs on to consumers. Similar evidence has been found for the euro area. See de Bondt, G., Morris, R.
