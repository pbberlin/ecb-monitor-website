1/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
François Villeroy de Galhau: For a high speed and safe journey into 
the financial future
Speech by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, at the 
Bank of France high-level conference on speed and innovation in financial markets and 
market infrastructures, Paris, 28 January 2025.

Ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great pleasure to welcome you to this high-level conference organised by the 
Banque de France on speed and innovation, and how they could be disruptive for 
financial markets and market infrastructures. Let me thank Emmanuelle Assouan and 
her teams for setting up this event. I would also like to extend my warm thanks to all 
participants from industry, public authorities and central banks who will give their views 
during three roundtables today, including my colleagues and friends Andrea Maechler, 
Piero Cipollone and Naoto Shimoda.
It is a for a Banque de France conference to be held here at the  première 
Cinémathèque française, which is definitely an excellent venue for our theme of today: 
we are here in the place where speed is made art. As you know, cinema was invented 
in France by the Lumière brothers in the late 19th century. During the projection in 1896 
of one of their very first movies, , the audience  The arrival of a train at La Ciotat station
was so overwhelmed by the moving image of a train coming directly at them that people 
ran away. But we do not fear speed anymore, on the contrary: it has become a key 
success factor in financial markets and market infrastructures, yielding high benefits. 
Transactions and their settlement have already become dramatically swifter over the 
last decades – notably in France, which was at the forefront in dematerialising 
securities – and will continue gathering speed. I will first elaborate on the reasons why, 
in a fast-moving environment, resilience must be preserved in order to ensure financial 
stability (I). Our public-private partnership has to evolve, with a view to enhancing cross-
border payments and the holistic project of creating a shared ledger (II). 
I. A fast-moving financial system whose resilience must be preserved 
in order to ensure financial stability
Markets are undergoing structural changes, all driven by increased speed aimed at 
achieving higher efficiency. Automation and high-frequency trading are driving a rise in 
daily trading volumes; new participants have emerged, and incumbents have evolved. 
Nowadays, robots and algorithms are unlocking new possibilities, while artificial 
intelligence offers the promise of value added in trading, customer relationships and 
investment decisions. From photography to digital movies, from local theatres to global 
web platforms, cinematography has gone through technological revolutions over the 
years. However, whether it's in cinema or finance, speed is not a goal per se. The 
social utility of certain accelerations such as high-frequency trading remains to be seen, 
and they carry risks. We must reflect on new guardrails to protect against possible 
increased market volatility – and even potential flash crashes caused by poorly 
coordinated algorithms that can amplify massive sell-offs.
 

2/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Post-market processes are keeping pace with this acceleration in trading: settlement is 
getting ever faster. A few years ago, implementing T+2 (i.e. ensuring settlement within 
two days of transaction execution) was a major step forward for all players, as 
enshrined in the European CSDR regulation. Nowadays we are once again aiming for i
more ambitious targets, with an objective of T+1 in Europe in 2027 – as has already 
been the case in the United States, Canada and Mexico since end-May last year. 
Interestingly, across the Atlantic, this evolution was driven by market players, who saw 
in the shortening of the settlement cycle an opportunity to further reduce liquidity, 
counterparty and operational risks. The American experience also shows that T+1 
yields direct financial benefits, in particular a significant lowering of CCP margins. T+1 
therefore received overall support in ESMA's and the Commission's public 
consultations. I trust that we are all well aware of the operational requirements and 
challenges to be met:  preparatory work must start now, with the adaptation of IT ii
systems and further automation of processes. It is also important to coordinate with the 
United Kingdom and Switzerland, and to pay due attention to the consequences in 
terms of shorter cut-offs – notably for FX transactions.
 
The tokenisation of assets is obviously another groundswell movement, which could 
further enhance the straight-through processing of trade and post-trade activities, and 
paves the way for yet another acceleration with a widespread implementation of T+0. It 
has the potential to generate even greater savings both for the financial industry and 
end-users. To date, the nascent DLT  finance has used new forms of commercial bank iii
money as settlement assets, such as tokenised deposits or so-called stablecoins. As 
experience has shown in the last few years, they are far from immune, and Europe has 
made the right step by adopting the MiCA regulation. Failing to regulate crypto-assets 
and non-banks today would merely sow the seeds for tomorrow's financial crisis.
 
Beyond these regulatory issues, it has become more and more apparent that we 
currently lack the anchor provided by central bank money, which drastically reduces 
counterparty and liquidity risks, and crucially ensures the finality of payments. A 
wholesale central bank digital currency would ensure convertibility between tokenised 
assets, exactly as central banks currently ensure convertibility between commercial 
bank monies, allowing for delivery-versus-payment and payment-versus-payment. In 
short, tokenised central bank money would provide a "safety pivot", and serve as a 
reliable basis of trust on which these new technologies could realise their full potential.
II. A step further with the interlinking of fast-payment systems and a 
European shared ledger to meet the challenges of transition and 
growth
 
Central banks must therefore keep up with these developments,  in order to explore iv
the potential of DLT and foster innovation while preserving the anchoring role of central 
bank money. Building among others on the Banque de France's pioneering 
experiments between 2020 and 2023,  the Eurosystem conducted a series of new v
experiments on wholesale CBDC between April and November 2024,  with the active vi
involvement of the Banque de France, Banca d'Italia and Bundesbank as solution 
providers. We witnessed active industry participation in the Eurosystem experiments,

and I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to your strong commitment – 
which, I believe, also reflects the growing awareness of the need for a safe settlement 
asset.
 
Together, we successfully tested numerous and very diverse use cases, ranging from 
primary issues to cross-currency payments, repos, margin calls and asset 
management, to give a few examples. Actual settlement was even tested for the 
lifecycle management of securities and secondary market transactions. With this 
ambitious programme, we have further delivered on our learning-by-doing approach, 
which is of the essence. As announced, the Eurosystem will draw lessons from the 
exploratory work, including on how to facilitate the provision of central bank money 
settlement for wholesale asset transactions on DLT platforms. Clearly, it is in the 
interest of both European commercial banks and the public sector to work together 
towards a tokenised European framework: money is and will remain a public-private 
partnership, which has to evolve.
 
As regards cross-border payments, the Eurosystem has launched initiatives to help 
improve them, including exploratory work on linking TIPS with other fast-payment 
systems such as UPI in India. We thereby support the G20 roadmap for creating a 
faster, cheaper, more transparent and accessible global payments ecosystem, while 
ensuring secure and reliable instant payments. The G20 roadmap also foresees, in the 
longer term, the use of tokenisation to further enhance cross-border payments.
 
We now need to bring all these advances together to create a global motion picture, in 
a holistic manner. Here, the idea of a "unified ledger" put forward by the BIS  looks vii
like more than a promising technology: a rallying concept, or even a utopia. This next-
generation market infrastructure would take one day in the future the shape of a shared, 
seamless and programmable platform that integrates central bank money, commercial 
bank money and tokenised financial assets – which would call for redefined and 
improved public-private partnerships. Accordingly, in April 2024 the BIS launched 
Project Agorá, to explore the tokenisation of cross-border payments to improve the viii 
existing correspondent banking model. This major project brings together seven central 
banks worldwide, including the Banque de France which represents the Eurosystem, 
and a large group of private financial firms. But a first and necessary step towards such 
a global infrastructure should be to build regional shared ledgers – one of which would 
be European.
 
A European shared ledger could prove an efficient means to overcome European 
market fragmentation and current inefficiencies, by facilitating the provision of 
seamlessly connected services across Europe. It would therefore act as a catalyst for a 
Savings and Investments Union, and provide tools such as green bonds and securities 
to finance the green transition, at a time where we have to mobilise Europe's private 
savings surplus of more than EUR 300 billion a year. In short, it would be an important 
lever for achieving our climate but also digital transformations, which are among our 
main challenges; it would also help Europe to gain in both size – by unifying its single 
market – and speed. Achieving this ambitious vision requires moving forward step by 
step, in a phased approach. Rather than replacing existing infrastructures which have 
already helped to reduce fragmentation in Europe – like the harmonised settlement 
system T2S –, this new shared infrastructure would tackle markets which still rely on 
manual processes and lack standardisation, such as OTC markets and unlisted stocks.

A crucial first step will be to make central bank money available on this infrastructure: 
this makes it all the more important to offer a wholesale CBDC solution in the short term 
to prepare this long term target.
Let me conclude with Billy Wilder, the director of . He once gave this  Some like it hot
sound piece of advice: "If you have a problem with the third act, the real problem is in 
the first act." This leads me to a twofold conclusion: first, that it is the right time to 
engage in the design and experimentation of market infrastructures of the future; 
second, that fast-paced transformations should not be at the expense of past 
achievements in financial stability, and increase risks. Central bank money must remain 
the settlement asset at the core of the financial system, whether tokenised or not. 
Under this condition, our common technological breakthroughs could contribute to 
meeting our major challenges. Thank you for your attention.
