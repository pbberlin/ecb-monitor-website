1/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Christine Lagarde: ECB press conference - introductory statement
Introductory statement by Ms Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central 
Bank, and Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Florence, 
30 October 2025.
* * *
Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. I would 
like to thank Governor Panetta for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude 
to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council.
The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates 
unchanged. Inflation remains close to our two per cent medium-term target and our 
assessment of the inflation outlook is broadly unchanged. The economy has continued 
to grow despite the challenging global environment. The robust labour market, solid 
private sector balance sheets and our past interest rate cuts remain important sources 
of resilience. However, the outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global 
trade disputes and geopolitical tensions.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises at our two per cent target in the 
medium term. We will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to 
determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our interest rate 
decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook and the risks 
surrounding it, in light of the incoming economic and financial data, as well as the 
dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We 
are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
The decisions taken today are set out in a available on our website. press release 
I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and 
will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.
Economic activity
The economy grew by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter of the year, according to 
Eurostat's preliminary flash estimate published today.The services sector continued to  
grow, boosted by strong tourism and, especially, by a pick-up in digital services. 
According to surveys, the pick-up reflects the fact that many firms have stepped up 
efforts to modernise their IT infrastructures and integrate artificial intelligence into their 
operations.Meanwhile, manufacturing was held back by higher tariffs, still-heightened  
uncertainty and a stronger euro.
The divergence between domestic and external demand is likely to persist in the near 
term. The economy should benefit from consumers spending more as real incomes rise.
Unemployment, at 6.3 per cent in September, remains close to its historical low, even  
though demand for labour has cooled. Households continue to save an unusually large

proportion of their incomes, which should give them greater margin to increase 
spending further. Substantial government expenditure on infrastructure and defence, as 
well as our past interest rate cuts, should underpin investment.
By contrast, the global environment is likely to remain a drag. Goods exports declined 
from March to August, reversing the earlier frontloading of international trade ahead of 
recent tariff increases. New export orders in manufacturing point to further declines. 
The full impact of higher tariffs on euro area exports and manufacturing investment will 
only become visible over time.
The Governing Council stresses the urgent need to strengthen the euro area and its 
economy in the present geopolitical environment, and we welcome EU leaders 
reaffirming this ambition at last week's Euro Summit. Fiscal and structural policies 
should boost productivity, competitiveness and resilience. It is essential to implement 
the European Commission's competitiveness roadmap swiftly. Governments should 
prioritise growth-enhancing structural reforms and strategic investment, while ensuring 
sustainable public finances. It is also vital to foster further capital market integration by 
completing the savings and investments union and the banking union to an ambitious 
timetable, and to rapidly adopt the regulation on the establishment of a digital euro.
The Governing Council is committed to making retail and wholesale central bank money 
fit for the digital age. In this vein, the Governing Council today decided to move to the 
next stage of the digital euro project. This will ensure technical readiness for potential 
issuance and support Europe's digital sovereignty once the legislation has been 
adopted. The details of this decision are available in a separate. press release
Inflation
Annual inflation increased to 2.2 per cent in September, from 2.0 per cent in August. 
This was mainly because energy prices fell by less than before. Energy price inflation 
was -0.4 per cent in September, up from -2.0 per cent in August. Meanwhile, food price 
inflation eased to 3.0 per cent in September, from 3.2 per cent in August. Inflation 
excluding energy and food rose to 2.4 per cent, from 2.3 per cent in August, as services 
inflation ticked up from 3.1 per cent to 3.2 per cent, while goods inflation was again 
unchanged at 0.8 per cent.
Indicators of underlying inflation remain consistent with our two per cent medium-term 
target.While firms' profits are recovering, labour costs are set to moderate further  
owing to rising productivity and an easing in wage growth. Forward-looking indicators, 
such as the ECB's wage tracker and surveys on wage expectations, point to slower 
wage growth over the remainder of the year and the first half of 2026.
Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continue to stand at around 2 per 
cent, supporting the stabilisation of inflation around our target.
Risk assessment
The EU-US trade deal reached over the summer, the recently announced ceasefire in 
the Middle East and today's announcement of progress in the US-China trade 
negotiations have mitigated some of the downside risks to economic growth. At the

same time, the still volatile global trade environment could disrupt supply chains, further 
dampen exports, and weigh on consumption and investment. A deterioration in financial 
market sentiment could lead to tighter financing conditions, greater risk aversion and 
weaker growth. Geopolitical tensions, in particular Russia's unjustified war against 
Ukraine, remain a major source of uncertainty. By contrast, higher than expected 
defence and infrastructure spending, together with productivity-enhancing reforms, 
would add to growth. An improvement in business confidence could stimulate private 
investment. Sentiment could also be lifted and activity spurred if the remaining 
geopolitical tensions diminished, or if the remaining trade disputes were resolved faster 
than expected.
The outlook for inflation continues to be more uncertain than usual on account of the 
still volatile global trade policy environment. A stronger euro could bring inflation down 
further than expected. Moreover, inflation could turn out to be lower if higher tariffs lead 
to lower demand for euro area exports and induce countries with overcapacity to further 
increase their exports to the euro area. An increase in volatility and risk aversion in 
financial markets could weigh on domestic demand and thereby also lower inflation. By 
contrast, inflation could turn out to be higher if a fragmentation of global supply chains 
pushed up import prices, curtailed the supply of critical raw materials and added to 
capacity constraints in the domestic economy. A boost in defence and infrastructure 
spending could also raise inflation over the medium term. Extreme weather events, and 
the unfolding climate and nature crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more 
than expected.
Financial and monetary conditions
Since our last meeting, market rates have remained broadly unchanged. Our past 
interest rate cuts have continued to reduce bank lending rates for firms, which averaged 
3.5 per cent in August. Meanwhile, the cost of issuing market-based debt remained at 
3.5 per cent in August, as the longer-term yields on which such debt is priced have 
been relatively stable.
The annual growth rate of bank lending to firms edged down to 2.9 per cent in 
September, from 3.0 per cent in August. At the same time, corporate bond issuance 
slowed to 3.3 per cent on a yearly basis. According to our latest bank lending survey for 
the euro area, credit standards for business loans tightened moderately in the third 
quarter, as banks became more concerned about the risks faced by their customers. 
Firms' demand for credit picked up slightly.
The average interest rate on new mortgages has barely changed since the start of the 
year and stood at 3.3 per cent in August. Growth in mortgage lending ticked up to 2.6 
per cent in September, from 2.5 per cent in August, on the back of a further increase in 
demand and unchanged credit standards in the third quarter.
Growth in broad money – as measured by M3 – slowed to 2.8 per cent in September, 
down from 2.9 per cent in August and an average of 3.8 per cent over the first half of 
the year.
Conclusion

4/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates 
unchanged. We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises at our two per cent 
target in the medium term. We will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting 
approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. Our interest rate 
decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook and the risks 
surrounding it, in light of the incoming economic and financial data, as well as the 
dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We 
are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to 
ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our medium-term target and to preserve 
the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission.
We are now ready to take your questions.
