European Semester Conference 
 
Inter-parliamentary conference on stability, economic coordination and 
governance in the EU 
 
Strategic investment and reforms in view of enhancing EU’s growth potential  
 
Opening keynote by Pierre Wunsch, Governor of the National Bank of Belgium 
 
 
AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY 
 
 
• It is an honour to open this session on strategic investment and reforms to boost 
EU’s growth potential . In these uncertain times, this is an even more daunting 
challenge than ever before.  
 
• It is of course impossible to do justice to the richness and complexity of the matter 
in ten minutes. I can therefore only be impressionistic as Monet, the painter, would 
have been. 
 
• At least since the turn of the century , Europe has been keenly aware of the 
structural constraints impinging on its economic dynamism. Typically, the policy 
response has been framed in terms of multi -year plans  implying “more Europe”  
supported by a grand vision and very often big funding announcements in support 
of transformative projects or policies.  
 
• Some of us remember the objective of the Lisbon Strategy, adopted in 2000, which 
ambitioned to turn the EU into (I quote)  “the most competitive and dynamic 
knowledge-based economy in the world. ” All this was to be achieved by  2010 
thanks to coordinated and ambitious structural reforms. A similar approach was 
behind the “Europe 2020” agenda in 2010 or the Commission’s Investment Plan for 
Europe in 2014 (or Juncker Plan) which aimed at encouraging more than 300 billion 
euro in additional investment over 3 years. 
 
• The most recent incarnation of that  think-big-spend-big paradigm are the NGEU 
and Fit for 55 ambitions . Once again, a cocktail of massive  investment and 
structural reforms should make the EU world champions, this time on the climate 
front, while still boosting growth and sustainable public finances.  
 
• Now, do not get me wrong: we do need structural reforms, and more investments 
and sound public finances, as much as we need a banking union, a capital market 
union, a fiscal union, and what not.  
 
• But there is a growing feeling , impression, and maybe even a consensus that we 
are lagging behind… Behind our own ambitions, but also behind the US and others 
when it comes to investment, innovation and growth.  
 
• Recently, the title of an article was reading (I did not read the article, one does not 
do that anymore, but I should have tweeted about it): “The US innovates, China 
imitates, and Europe regulates.”

• This might be unfair, but there is certainly a widespread impression that this is , at 
least partly, true. And indeed, data do not look great.  
 
o Data on public and private investment,as well as GDP per capita, shows that 
despite our many plans, the EA has trailed the US. 
o Looking at a more granular level, we seem to be stuck between the US (with 
its digital champions and cheap energy) and China (with its significant cost 
advantages on the very green technologies we wanted to foster: solar 
panels, EVs , and even windmills.) ; all this with no obvious positioning 
between the two. 
o On the energy front, US natural gas is at 10€/MWh. Before the war in 
Ukraine, we were at around 20€/MWh. The new normal for us is now 
between 30-50€/MWh… to which we must add an additional 20- 30€/MWh 
for carbon capture and/or blue hydrogen. That is 5 to 8 times higher than in 
the US. So, yes, one might ask : is there a future for EU energy intensive 
firms ? 
 
• Clearly, t he challenges presently facing the EU are truly transformative . They 
require extensive reallocation of resources across sectors , the rapid adoption of  
new technologies, and disruptive innovations. All three involve ample funding and 
significant risk taking.  
 
• If history is any guide, though, Europe’s economy is bad at reallocations (the old 
sclerosis story) and slower than its competitors at embracing new technologies. We 
are by now used to the fact that the digital giants of this World are all American (or 
Chinese). If anything, the fact that Tesla was born in the US came as a shock. But 
then again, Elon Musk has a way of doing things that is not quite European. 
 
• What I am saying here is that, to some extent, what you see in Europe may be the 
result of our deep preferences. By that I mean a greater risk aversion than our 
competitors. And maybe also a stronger preference for leisure? As European 
elections loom, I detect a fear of greening, a fear of war, a fear of China, and a fear 
of demographics fuelled by the aging-migration nexus. 
 
• Is Europe doomed then? I don’t believe so, but the path to our big goals is relatively 
narrow and fraught with uncertainties.  
 
• European economies are still rich and resourceful; and they still have some time to 
take advantage of their current wealth in a way that secures future prosperity.  
 
• However, when thinking about the transformative period ahead of us,  a few facts 
and lessons from the past seem useful to keep in mind.  
o First, throwing massive amounts of money at problems just to mitigate their 
effects is not a panacea.  It might be OK for short-term crisis management, 
as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic showed. But this is not a longer-
term strategy. 
o Second, there is no funding problem. Overall, we still live in a world where 
too much savings chases too little investment , as sh own by interest rates 
that remain very low when you factor in inflation ( the so-called real rates). 
Debt is not as cheap as it was, but it remains very affordable.  The question 
is why is there too little investment? What are the binding constraints? To be 
sure, it is not funding.

o Third, I believe we do have a real issue with our regulatory burden  (as well 
as permitting on the climate front) . Even as a central banker , how many 
times have I not heard: “Well, if we follow the opinion of our legal department, 
then we just cannot do it”. And we are not building anything, j ust working 
with computers and data. 
 
Faced with the uncertainties of the day, t he name of the game can not be more 
protection (of our people, our firms, and our markets) . And yet, people will demand it. 
It is a very difficult political equation. 
 
• The way out is to provide a vision credible enough to change the mindset. This is 
far more easily said than done, especially in a fragmented society where individuals 
can choose information sources that suit their subjective priors.  
 
• In my humble opinion, the new mindset will have to recognize some of the difficult 
trade-offs we are facing. Navigating these trade-offs inevitably creates winners and 
losers in the short to medium term. 
 
• The new mindset will also have to shift from one where easy money can solve all 
problems (typically after they happen)  to one where we have realistic plans to 
handle difficult transitions (climate, digital, demographic), as well as communication 
strategies that better recognize the challenges ahead.  
 
Let me try to briefly illustrate these considerations with climate policies. 
 
Only a small minority lives in denial of the need to act. And I believe that Europe got it 
right. Its strategy is in my view more credible than the US IRA, which is incredibly costly 
and detrimental to the US trade partners.  [After all, as John Hassler quipped:  “If the 
problem is overfishing, subsidizing chicken will not make it”]. 
 
• So where do I see issues in Europe?  
• First, and I would say as usual  in Europe, the debate has been largely framed 
as one of “finding” a lot of money, while at the same time reassuring citizens 
(and voters) that it would not cost much.  
• The emphasis on “finding money” is misplaced.  It is a matter of spending 
priorities, for the public as well as for the private sector. A combination of 
adequate regulations (adequate meaning “credible and predictable”) and 
carbon pricing should shape everyone’s incentives to achieve our climate 
ambitions.  
• Second, I think we could and should rethink the official communication around 
the climate transition. We should be more candid. Specifically: 
o Don’t lure people into thinking that greening carries positive opportunities 
that could augment  GDP and create mi llions of well- paid jobs . As a 
macroeconomist, it is my job to tell you that the climate transition is a 
negative “supply shock,” one that will reduce our growth potential.  
o So you heard me, this transition is not going to make us collectively 
richer.  
o To be sure, there will be winners, but also many losers. And we should 
say it because i f public authorities are caught living in denial, they will 
lose their most precious asset: credibility.  Without credibility , the first 
concrete signs of emerging problems will encourage popular anger  and 
protests. Just look at farmers...

o Admitting what I just said then forces us answer two difficult questions: 
how much will it cost and who will pay? I n providing answers, we must 
be clear on the uncertainties surrounding our estimates  and the policy 
contingencies we are prepared to activate if problems materialize. 
o There is a growing consensus that the costs of the transition are similar 
in magnitude to a (significant) oil or energy shock, but spread over 26 
years, not weeks, as in the 1970s. 
o So I am one of those who believe that the aggregate shock to our 
collective wealth should be manageable. 
o But we should still do our homework on the “who will pay ?” part of the 
question. This requires a granular and realistic understanding of the 
costs per sector, but also of other political and technical constraints. 
Think about gas boilers in Germany... 
  
As I am about to close, I must mention the elephant in the room: geopolitics. Everyone 
understands that global warming is… well, global; and that the EU emits only a small 
fraction of greenhouse gas . So, the question of who will pay is as much about the 
different groups in our societies , as it is about other countries around the world, 
especially the US and China.  
 
In the old world of rules-based international relations, a reasonable hope would have 
been that international policy coordination could  provide a satisfactory solution. 
However, t he recent CO Ps have dashed my hopes . I will not risk my reputation 
anticipating what the outcome of the strategic interactions between the 3 big players 
might be. I will only share a few worries and unanswered questions.  
• First, I am worried about the faith one seems to be putting in the Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism and in industrial policies of all breeds. As I already 
mentioned, energy prices in Europe put us at a serious disadvantage compared 
to the US, which have access to cheap energy, do not intend to tax carbon, and 
have opted to subsidize clean energy. While we could expect a cheaper euro to 
correct for part of Europe’s competitiveness gap with the US, a weak currency 
is not a permanent solution.  
• Second, although Europe probably never was t he most innovative economy, it 
was good at incremental technological progress, but much less at the disruptive 
type, which is becoming more important . Besides, looking beyond quantum, 
superior quality is often associated with our continent: the quality of the products 
we make, but more broadly, the better quality of life and greater social equity 
we achieve given a lower GDP per capita than the US.  I would nevert heless 
caution against the sense of complacency that might come out of this line of 
thinking. Permanently trailing our competitors will ultimately undermine our 
welfare. That will not be acceptable to the people. 
• Third, in the great power game now underway , Europe’s traditional foreign 
policy doctrine comes under stress. While EU countries operate well in the safe 
environment of rules -based international relations  cemented by international 
organizations and strong transatlantic ties , it seems to be less effective in 
establishing a “rapport de force”  to its advantage  in t oday’s multipolar and 
transactional world. The readiness to be shrewd , or even disruptive,  on the 
global stage is not something a politi cally fragmented EU can hope to deliver 
any time soon. 
• This leaves us with important open questions: How can we preserve our single 
market while competing with the US and China? How can we be at the same

time agile and rule-based? How can we fulfil our ambitious climate objectives, 
while being candid about their implications? 
 
At the end of the day, it is all about politics. So, my job is easier than yours. Let that 
be clear between us. 
 
Thank you very much for your attention.
