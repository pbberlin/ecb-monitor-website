1/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Christine Lagarde: ECB press conference - introductory statement
Introductory statement by Ms Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central 
Bank, and Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt 
am Main, 17 April 2025.

Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 
basis points. In particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate 
through which we steer the monetary policy stance – is based on our updated 
assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the 
strength of monetary policy transmission.
The disinflation process is well on track. Inflation has continued to develop as staff 
expected, with both headline and core inflation declining in March. Services inflation 
has also eased markedly over recent months. Most measures of underlying inflation 
suggest that inflation will settle at around our two per cent medium-term target on a 
sustained basis. Wage growth is moderating, and profits are partially buffering the 
impact of still elevated wage growth on inflation. The euro area economy has been 
building up some resilience against global shocks, but the outlook for growth has 
deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions. Increased uncertainty is likely to reduce 
confidence among households and firms, and the adverse and volatile market response 
to the trade tensions is likely to have a tightening impact on financing conditions. These 
factors may further weigh on the economic outlook for the euro area.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent 
medium-term target. Especially in current conditions of exceptional uncertainty, we will 
follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the 
appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be 
based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and 
financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy 
transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
The decisions taken today are set out in a available on our website. press release 
I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and 
will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.
Economic activity
The economic outlook is clouded by exceptional uncertainty. Euro area exporters face 
new barriers to trade, although their scope remains unclear. Disruptions to international 
commerce, financial market tensions and geopolitical uncertainty are weighing on 
business investment. As consumers become more cautious about the future, they may 
hold back from spending as well.

At the same time, the euro area economy has been building up some resilience against 
the global shocks. The economy is likely to have grown in the first quarter of the year, 
and manufacturing has shown signs of stabilisation. Unemployment fell to 6.1 per cent 
in February, its lowest level since the launch of the euro. A strong labour market, higher 
real incomes and the impact of our monetary policy should underpin spending. The 
important policy initiatives that have been launched at the national and EU levels to 
increase defence spending and infrastructure investment can be expected to bolster 
manufacturing, which is also reflected in recent surveys.
In the present geopolitical environment, it is even more urgent for fiscal and structural 
policies to make the euro area economy more productive, competitive and resilient.The  
European Commission's Competitiveness Compass provides a concrete roadmap for 
action, and its proposals, including on simplification, should be swiftly adopted. This 
includes completing the savings and investment union, following a clear and ambitious 
timetable, which should help savers benefit from more opportunities to invest and 
improve firms' access to finance, especially risk capital. It is also important to rapidly 
establish the legislative framework to prepare the ground for the potential introduction of 
a digital euro. Governments should ensure sustainable public finances in line with the 
EU's economic governance framework and prioritise essential growth-enhancing 
structural reforms and strategic investment.
Inflation
Annual inflation edged down to 2.2 per cent in March. Energy prices fell by 1.0 per cent, 
after a slight rise in February, while food price inflation rose to 2.9 per cent in March, 
from 2.7 per cent in February. Goods inflation was stable at 0.6 per cent. Services 
inflation fell again in March, to 3.5 per cent, and it now stands half a percentage point 
below the rate recorded at the end of last year.
Most indicators of underlying inflation are pointing to a sustained return of inflation to 
our two per cent medium-term target. Domestic inflation has declined since the end of 
2024. Wages are gradually moderating. In the last quarter of 2024 annual growth in 
compensation per employee stood at 4.1 per cent, down from 4.5 per cent in the 
previous quarter. Rising productivity also meant that unit labour costs grew more slowly. 
The ECB's wage tracker and information from our contacts with companies point to a 
decline in wage growth in 2025, as also indicated in the March staff projections. Unit 
profits fell at an annual rate of 1.1 per cent at the end of last year, contributing to lower 
domestic inflation.
Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continue to stand at around 2 per 
cent, which supports the sustainable return of inflation to our target.
Risk assessment
Downside risks to economic growth have increased. The major escalation in global 
trade tensions and associated uncertainties will likely lower euro area growth by 
dampening exports, and it may drag down investment and consumption. Deteriorating 
financial market sentiment could lead to tighter financing conditions, increase risk 
aversion and make firms and households less willing to invest and consume. 
Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic 

3/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
conflict in the Middle East, also remain a major source of uncertainty. At the same time, 
an increase in defence and infrastructure spending would add to growth.
Increasing global trade disruptions are adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro 
area inflation. Falling global energy prices and appreciation of the euro could put further 
downward pressure on inflation. This could be reinforced by lower demand for euro 
area exports owing to higher tariffs, and a re-routing of exports into the euro area from 
countries with overcapacity. Adverse financial market reactions to the trade tensions 
could weigh on domestic demand and thereby also lower inflation. By contrast, a 
fragmentation of global supply chains could raise inflation by pushing up import prices. 
A boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation over the 
medium term. Extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, 
could drive up food prices by more than expected.
Financial and monetary conditions
Risk-free interest rates have declined in response to the escalating trade tensions. 
Equity prices have fallen amid high volatility and corporate bond spreads have widened 
around the globe. The euro has strengthened over recent weeks as investor sentiment 
has proven more resilient towards the euro area than towards other economies.
The latest official statistics on corporate borrowing, which predated these market 
tensions, continued to indicate that our interest rate cuts had madeit less expensive for  
firms to borrow. The average interest rate on new loans to firms declined to 4.1 per cent 
in February, from 4.3 per cent in January. Firms' cost of issuing market-based debt 
declined to 3.5 per cent in February, but there has been some upward pressure more 
recently. Moreover, growth in lending to firms picked up again in February, to 2.2 per 
cent, whiledebt securities issuance by firms grew at an unchanged rate of 3.2 per cent. 
At the same time, credit standards for business loans tightened slightly again in the first 
quarter of 2025, as reported in our latest bank lending survey for the euro area. As in 
the previous quarter, this was mainly because banks are becoming more concerned 
about the economic risks faced by their customers. Demand for loans to firms 
decreased slightly in the first quarter, after a modest recovery in previous quarters.
The average rate on new mortgages, at 3.3 per cent in February, increased on the back 
of earlier rises in longer-term market rates. Mortgage lending continued to strengthen in 
February, albeit at a still subdued annual rate of 1.5 per cent, as banks eased their 
credit standards and demand for loans to households continued to increase strongly.

The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25

through which we steer the monetary policy stance – is based on our updated

our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in 
light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation 
and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a 
particular rate path.
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to 
ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our medium-term target and to preserve 
the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission.
We are now ready to take your questions.
