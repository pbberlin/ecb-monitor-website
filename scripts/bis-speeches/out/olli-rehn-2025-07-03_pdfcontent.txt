strategic investment

Bank of Finland and European Systemic Risk Board Joint Conference on AI and 
Systemic Risk Analytics, Helsinki, 27 June 2025.

Professor Johnson, Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a great pleasure to welcome all of you – both in person and online – to the 10th 
Joint Conference on AI and Systemic Risk Analytics. We are honoured to host this 
anniversary together with RiskLab Finland and the European Systemic Risk Board.
Back in 2015, the first SRA conference focused on topics like contagion, systemic risk, 
big data, and macroprudential policy. Those themes remain just as relevant today. But 
we've also seen a significant shift. Artificial intelligence, once emerging, is now central. 
So central, in fact, that it has become part of the title of this conference.
Over the past ten years, this event has consistently asked the hard questions: Where 
do new financial risks come from? How do they spread? And what tools can we use to 
understand them? Most importantly – what policies can help us mitigate them?
My predecessor, Governor Erkki Liikanen, who is now co-chair of the CFA Institute's 
Systemic Risk Council with Simon Johnson, offered three key messages in 2015 that 
still guide us today:
A deeper understanding of systemic risks improves regulation and 
macroprudential policy.
Expert judgement is essential, especially in imagining unlikely but serious 
scenarios.
Research must help us strike the right balance between simplicity and depth in 
regulation.
These points remain as relevant as ever. Although much has been achieved to 
enhance financial stability, vulnerabilities persist – especially in liquidity stress and 
market interconnections. This is why the analysis of contagion, market dynamics and 
tail risks must continue. We also need robust scenario analysis and modelling to guide 
decision-making.
Moreover, in today's climate, there is increasing pressure to simplify financial 
regulation. That makes independent research all the more critical in safeguarding the 
resilience of our financial system.
Technology and Transformation

2/3 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Technology is changing how we analyse data. In a world saturated with both 
information and disinformation, it's not just about access to data. It's about the ability to 
interpret it accurately and act on it swiftly.
AI is a powerful tool in this regard. But it also challenges us. We must continually 
upgrade our skills, update our methods, and ensure our decisions rest on sound, 
comprehensive analysis.
Digitalisation opens new opportunities but also exposes us to new threats. Cyber risks 
are not new, but geopolitical tensions make them more dangerous. Operational 
resilience is now a systemic issue. It demands international coordination and a clear 
understanding of how disruptions can spread through networks-both digital and 
financial.
We must also ask: will the benefits of AI be shared equally? Or will some regions fall 
behind? These are questions we'll explore more deeply shortly in our fireside chat with 
Professor Johnson.
Stablecoins and Systemic Risk
Before closing, a few words about the European Systemic Risk Board where we have a 
busy week behind us.
On Tuesday we concluded the review of functioning of the Systemic Risk Board. In the 
future the ESRB will increasingly focus on the holistic assessment of systemic risks, 
especially by developing methodology for system-wide stress-testing. It is essential to 
understand better the key interconnections and true fundamental changes in the 
financial system.
One particular area which is currently under scrutiny is cryptos and especially 
stablecoins. Stablecoins are crypto assets pegged one-to-one to assets like US dollar, 
supposedly to keep a stable value. But they are unregulated and not backed e.g. by any 
central bank liquidity support.
With the view of policies and statements of the US administration, we are entering the 
era of licenced stablecoins on the other side of the Atlantic – but with serious spillovers 
and risks to our side.
Stablecoin markets have grown rapidly.
For instance, Tether was in volume the 7th largest buyer of US Treasuries last year, 
just behind the UK but ahead of Canada, Hong Kong and Germany. Size of the 
stablecoin market is now above 200 bn euro. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has 
projected that the market could grow to 3 trillion USD by end of the decade, i.e. roughly 
15-fold.
There is an obvious political motivation to strengthen the position of the US dollar and 
increase the demand for US Treasuries. But that does not come without major risks.

3/3 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Especially concerning is the stablecoins' linkage to the traditional financial system 
through the interconnections, not least the one-to-one promise of paying USD (or any 
other currency that is promised).
That's why it is important to intensify the monitoring and deepen our understanding of 
the stablecoin markets and their interconnection with the regular banking and financial 
system.
Closing
With these thoughts, it is my great pleasure to introduce today's keynote speaker: 
Nobel Laureate Professor Simon Johnson.
Professor Johnson is a renowned economist, known for his work on institutions, 
prosperity and financial crises. In 2024, he received the Nobel Prize in Economic 
Sciences alongside Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. He is also Professor at MIT 
and co-chair of the CFA Institute's Systemic Risk Council.
I look forward to our conversation after his presentation. Please join me in warmly 
welcoming Professor Simon Johnson.
Thank you.
