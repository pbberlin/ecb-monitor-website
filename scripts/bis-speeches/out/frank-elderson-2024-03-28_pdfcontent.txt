1/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Frank Elderson: Taking into account climate and nature in monetary 
policy and banking supervision around the world
Remarks by Mr Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the European 
Central Bank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank, at 
an event on climate-related financial risks, hosted by the Central Bank of Brazil, Rio de 
Janeiro, 27 March 2024. 
* * *
Many thanks to the Banco Central do Brasil for inviting me here today. I am honoured to 
be speaking in Rio de Janeiro's botanical garden. It is home to more than 6,500 
different species – just a fraction of the more than 130,000 species that are estimated to 
be found in Brazil, the most biodiverse country in the world. But even this little glimpse 
into Brazil's biodiversity is more than sufficient to appreciate the concept of natural 
capital and the tremendous value it represents.
At the same time, global heating and nature degradation are putting this natural capital 
at risk. And central banks and supervisors around the world recognise that this poses a 
serious threat to the stability of our economies and the robustness of our financial 
system.
Let me be clear from the outset: central banks and supervisors are not, and do not 
intend to be, policymakers in the area of climate and nature. It is governments that are 
responsible for climate and nature policies. In my remarks today, I will explain why 
central banks and supervisors have no option but to take the ongoing climate and 
nature crises into account to deliver on their monetary policy and banking supervision 
mandates. And that is exactly what central banks and supervisors around the world are 
doing. We at the European Central Bank (ECB) are not alone in this work, as can be 
seen from the work being done by the Banco Central do Brasil and most other central 
banks and supervisors around the world.
The relevance of climate and nature for central banks and supervisors
Human-induced global heating and nature degradation are scientifically established 
facts. Their devastating consequences are becoming all the more apparent in the 
increasing number of hazards we are seeing around the world. We don't yet know 
exactly how the climate and nature crises will continue to unfold, partly because 
governments are taking mitigation and adaptation measures. This uncertainty also 
means that we don't know exactly how the economy and the financial system will be 
affected.
At the same time, analysis consistently shows the vital importance of climate and nature 
for central banks and supervisors.
First, whatever happens, the economic impact will be profound. If left unchecked, global 
heating and nature degradation will contribute to increased macroeconomic volatility as

climate and nature events become more frequent and have a greater impact on the 
economy. A successful transition to a green and sustainable economy, meanwhile, will 
require vast investment flows that will alter the way our economies function.
Second, the economic benefits of a timely transition far outweigh the costs, especially 
when considered against the alternative scenarios of doing nothing or doing too little too 
late.1
Third, climate-related risks translate into financial risks. Early work by the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) shows that climate events are a driver of 
each traditional type of risk considered in the regulatory framework, from credit risk, 
liquidity risk and market risk to reputational and operational risk, including legal risk.2 
Floods, for example, could damage a company's production facility, which could affect 
its ability to repay a loan, in turn leading to higher credit risk for the bank that provided 
the loan. Or consider what might happen if your house is built in an area vulnerable to 
wildfires. Your home could fall in value, leaving the bank that granted you the mortgage 
with higher risk on its balance sheet.
And these financial risks are not related solely to climate change. Last year, when 
looking at more than 4.2 million individual companies that account for over €4.2 trillion 
in corporate loans, we found that nearly 75% of all bank loans in the euro area are to 
companies that are highly dependent on at least one ecosystem service.Examples of 3 
these services include the products we obtain from ecosystems, such as food, drinking 
water, timber and minerals; protection against natural hazards; or carbon uptake and 
storage by vegetation. If these ecosystem services continue to experience the level of 
degradation they are currently facing, the stability of individual financial institutions and 
the broader financial system will be at risk.
International standard-setting bodies driving global action
Recognising the relevance of climate and nature-related factors for the economy, 
including the financial system, international standard-setting bodies are increasingly 
turning their attention to this topic. This has resulted in substantial progress at the 
global level, although more work lies ahead of us.
For example, the BCBS has a dedicated Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks, 
whose meeting this week is kindly hosted by the Banco Central do Brasil. Based on the 
work of this task force, the BCBS has taken concrete steps to incorporate climate-
related financial risks into the Basel framework for the global prudential regulation of 
banks. And progress has been made across all three pillars of the prudential 
framework: regulation, supervision and disclosures. On the topic of disclosures, late last 
year the BCBS issued a consultation paper on a proposed climate-related disclosure 
requirements framework, building on the work done in various other fora. The deadline 
for comments was two weeks ago and we are now carefully assessing the feedback 
received.
Meanwhile, there is also progress on nature-related risks. In view of the Brazilian G20 
Presidency's priority to deepen work on sustainability-related risk, the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB) will this year complement its climate-related work with a stocktake of 

3/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
current and planned regulatory and supervisory initiatives regarding nature-related 
financial risks. This may build on the work already done by the Central Banks and 
Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). Last year the NGFS – 
which has 138 members worldwide, including the Banco Central do Brasil – published a 
conceptual framework to guide action by central banks and supervisors in the area of 
nature-related risks.
The work currently being done by the BCBS, the FSB and the NGFS will ultimately find 
its way to other international standard-setting bodies and translate into concrete 
practices by individual central banks and supervisors.
ECB measures to take climate and nature into account
Let me give you some examples of actions we have taken at the ECB.
In 2021 we unveiled an ambitious climate action plan covering macroeconomic 
modelling, financial stability monitoring, data collection, risk assessment capabilities 
and our monetary policy operations. Many of the actions we planned have now been 
delivered. For instance, we have made significant progress in improving the models that 
we use in macroeconomic analysis supporting our monetary policy decisions. 
Moreover, we have in place a methodology to tilt the purchase of corporate bonds 
towards issuers with a better climate performance – if we ever need to buy corporate 
bonds again in the future. In the collateral framework for our lending operations, we only 
accept assets that comply with the relevant sustainability reporting requirements and 
we are looking at setting limits on the share of assets issued by entities with a large 
carbon footprint.
In the area of banking supervision, we have urged banks to ensure the sound 
management of climate and nature-related risks, using the supervisory expectations we 
published in 2020 as a starting point. These expectations give guidance on how banks 
should integrate climate and nature-related risks into their strategy, governance and risk 
management. It is very much consistent with the general supervisory principles that 
have been established by the BCBS.
Since the ECB first started discussing climate and nature-related risks with banks back 
in 2019, progress has undoubtedly been made. Banks have taken steps to integrate 
these risks into their strategy, governance and risk management. Although at present 
none of the banks under our supervision fully meets all our expectations, each of our 
expectations has already been fulfilled by at least one bank. It shows that progress is 
possible, and that it is not just taking place among a few banks, but across the board. 
This is good news, since we expect all banks under our supervision to be fully aligned 
with our supervisory expectations by the end of 2024. We will enforce this final deadline 
as well as several interim deadlines. In fact, a number of banks under our supervision 
have already received binding requirements to remedy shortcomings by a certain date. 
If they do not comply, they will have to pay a penalty for every day that the 
shortcomings remain unresolved.
Building on the results achieved and progress made, earlier this year the ECB 
announced a new climate and nature action plan. It sets out concrete steps to consider 
how, within our mandate, we can further support the green transition, assess the 

4/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
physical impacts of climate change and explore the materiality of nature-related risks. 
Moreover, when we completed a review of our operational framework for implementing 
monetary policy two weeks ago, we announced that climate change-related 
considerations will be incorporated into the design of future structural monetary policy 
operations.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The Amazon river is subject to the "Pororoca", one of the largest tidal bores in the 
world. It is an enormous wave travelling from the mouth of the Amazon on the Atlantic 
coast up to 800 kilometres upstream.
The climate and nature crises are unfolding. Together they are overflowing the 
economy and the financial system, very much like the "Pororoca" overflows the Amazon 
basin. Even if mitigation and adaptation measures are taken, one thing is certain: the 
world, the global economy and the financial system will see profound change.
In the words of Brazilian author Paulo Coelho: "You drown not from plunging into the 
water, but from staying submerged in it."Emerging from the climate and nature crises  
requires action from all authorities within their mandate. For central banks and 
supervisors, this means taking climate and nature into account in the pursuit of their 
monetary policy and supervisory objectives. If they failed to do so, they would be failing 
on their mandate. The work that we are doing individually and collectively proves that 
we will not allow this to happen.
Thank you for your attention.
