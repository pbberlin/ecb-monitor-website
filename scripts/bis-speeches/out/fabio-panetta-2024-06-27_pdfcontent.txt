Monetary policy after a perfect storm: festina lente
Speech by Fabio Panetta 
Governor of the Bank of Italy
3rd Bank of Finland International Monetary Policy Conference on  
‘Monetary Policy in Low and High Inflation Environments’1
Helsinki, 26 June 2024
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I would like to thank the Bank of Finland for 
organizing this conference, and Governor Rehn for inviting me. It is a great pleasure to 
be here. Finland has been crowned the happiest country in the world for the seventh 
consecutive year in the recently published World Happiness Report:2 I am really happy to 
be part of that happiness.
We are at a turning point in the European monetary policy cycle. In June, the Governing 
Council decided to cut the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points after holding them 
at high levels for nine months. Turning points inevitably attract attention, and the policy 
debate is now focused on the next steps: ECB watchers are eagerly looking for clues 
about the pace of the normalization path. 
I will briefly review what has happened to inflation over the past three years. I will then 
discuss some of the remaining concerns about the disinflation process, namely price 
developments in the services sector and the role of profits, input costs and labour costs. 
After that, I will examine the outlook for inflation and growth from a forward-looking 
perspective. I will outline my thoughts on the evolution of monetary policy before 
concluding.
My main message is that the disinflation process requires two ingredients. We must 
keep adjusting policy rates to complete the process and smoothly reach our 2 per cent 
inflation target in a scenario where our expectations turn out to be broadly correct. But

Marianna Riggi, Alessandro Secchi, Fabrizio Venditti and Eliana Viviano for their contributions and 
comments. Festina lente – “hasten slowly” – is the Latin motto that epitomised a decisive but calm policy 
action for Augustus, the first emperor of Rome. The motto was also used in XVI-century Florence by 
Cosimo I De’ Medici, whose fleet aptly adopted as a symbol a turtle endowed with sails.

we also need to be prudent, and stand ready to adjust our policy in response to shocks 
that may create upside or downside risks to the current outlook. 
1. Genesis and unfolding of a perfect storm
After years of low inflation, the euro area experienced an exceptional rise in prices between 
2021 and 2023 (Figure 1). Supply constraints, the rebound in consumption and soaring 
commodity and energy prices created a perfect storm for inflation. The nature of the storm 
has been debated in countless papers and opinion pieces, and I will not systematically 
review it again today.3 There are just a few points I would like to emphasize. 
The first one is that the conditions for the storm took shape in 2020, when inflation was 
close to zero. The pandemic disrupted supply chains and caused a structural shift in 
consumption patterns – including a reallocation from services to goods – that proved to 
be highly consequential in the following two years. 
The second point is that, paradoxically, the recovery in the US economy complicated 
the picture in the euro area. It was fast and strong, underpinned by a generous fiscal 
stimulus and the excess savings accumulated during the pandemic lockdowns, and it 
initially involved more goods than services. This led to large swings in relative prices, 
pushing up headline inflation; 4 it also strained supply chains and increased commodity 
and energy prices on international markets. In a twist of fate, a positive demand shock 
in the US turned into an additional negative supply shock for Europe.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 radically changed the inflation outlook. 
On the eve of the invasion, inflation was hovering around 5 per cent, and Eurosystem 
economists, analysts and investors broadly agreed that price pressures would recede 
relatively quickly. In the months that followed, an extraordinary series of energy and 
commodity price shocks doubled headline inflation, unsettling markets and central banks 
alike.5 In short, we entered into a different world.6
2. Should we (still) worry about services and wages?
In response to the rise in inflation, in July 2022 the ECB started an unprecedented series of 
rate hikes. This decisive response paid off: supply shocks, bottlenecks and soaring energy 
prices have not triggered an inflationary spiral, as they had in the past, and inflation 
expectations remained firmly anchored. The disinflation process is now well under way. 
Inflation fell from a peak of 10.6 per cent in October 2022 to 2.6 per cent in May, and the 
speed of the decline was unprecedented, as the previous increase. 
However, inflation has not yet returned to target. Some commentators have pointed 
to price dynamics in the services sector and the labour market as possible obstacles 
in the ‘last mile’ of the price stabilization efforts. We should certainly remain vigilant 
on developments in these areas, but a closer look at the data suggests that the ‘last 
mile’ may require nothing more than patience and a careful monitoring of the ongoing 
disinflation process.
2.1.	 The	rise	and	fall	of	inflation	in	the	services	sector
The services sector has attracted attention for two related reasons. First, services inflation 
seems to be more persistent than goods inflation. Second, services price growth remains 
above the ECB target. Let me discuss these points in turn.
The persistence is only apparent. It reflects the fact that inflation in the services sector 
started to rise later, peaked later and started to fall later. In turn, this delayed rise and 
fall depends on the combination of two forces. 
One is purely coincidental and specifically related to the pandemic episode. Initially, 
the recovery in consumption was mainly driven by demand for goods, in particular 
the durable goods that consumers were unable to buy during the first stage of the 
5 The shocks had a particularly severe impact on Europe, a net importer of most commodities – 
unfortunately including Russian gas. The exorbitant energy bills also left European households with 
far less money to spend on other goods and services than their American counterparts.
6 As this rough summary suggests, and as I have noted on previous occasions, the euro area faced a 
wave of particularly ‘bad’ inflation. The ‘good’ type is driven by buoyant domestic demand and wage 
growth consistent with the target; monetary policy should nurture it or mitigate it (depending on the 
initial level) until the target is reached. The ‘bad’ type reflects negative supply shocks that raise prices 
and depress economic activity; monetary policy should look through it. There is also an ‘ugly’ type 
of inflation driven by a de-anchoring of inflation expectations; monetary policy should immediately 
stamp it out. See Panetta F., 2021, ‘Patient monetary policy amid a rocky recovery’, speech delivered at 
Sciences Po, Paris, 24 November.

lockdowns. The consumption of goods recovered quickly in the euro area; it grew 
even faster in the US, where it exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Services consumption 
recovered later and more slowly, especially in the euro area (Figure 2).
The second force is structural. Goods and services react differently to exogenous cost-push  
shocks because they are characterized by different price adjustment mechanisms. In 
particular, price adjustments are slower for services. One reason for this is that many 
services are provided directly by the public sector or are subject to administrative and 
contractual frictions.7
Consider energy price shocks. Estimates based on historical data and standard 
econometric models show that, following an energy shock, non-energy industrial goods 
(NEIGs) inflation peaks in about one year and returns to equilibrium within two years; 
instead, services inflation peaks about six months later and normalizes after almost 
three years (Figure 3a). In terms of relative magnitude and timing, these estimates 
are virtually mirror images of the inflation patterns actually observed between 2022 
and 2024 (Figure 3b). This remarkable coincidence corroborates the hypothesis that 
the asymmetric propagation of energy shocks explains a good part of the ‘puzzling’ 
divergence between the two sectors.
The second concern is that services inflation remains higher than goods inflation and 
above the ECB target. However, this is not surprising: historically, it has almost always 
been the case. In the euro area, services inflation has been around 1 percentage point 
higher than goods inflation since the late 1990s; before the great financial crisis, it 
was also systematically above the ECB target (Figure 4). Whatever the explanation for 
7 The a-cyclical, backward-looking ‘latecomer’ items, which include rents and insurances as well as 
services directly provided by the public sector (health, education, post), played an important role in 
boosting inflation over the past 12 months (Figure A1).

this difference, the data suggest that there is no reason to expect goods and services 
inflation to coincide in the long run. 8 
8 Since services are less tradable than goods, the gap may reflect for instance a Balassa-Samuelson 
effect. According to this theory, if productivity grows faster in the tradable sector than in the non-
tradable sector (for instance because of international competition), while wages are equalized across 
sectors in equilibrium, then the relative price of tradables and non-tradables will diverge and the 
non-tradable sector will experience a higher inflation rate. Productivity growth has traditionally been 
higher in the goods sector, lending credibility to this interpretation of the data. See Balassa B., 1964, 
‘The purchasing-power parity doctrine: a reappraisal’, Journal of Political Economy , 72 (6) 584-596 and 
Samuelson P.A., 1964, ‘Theoretical notes on trade problems’, Review of Economics and Statistics , 46 (2)

What matters is the convergence of overall headline inflation towards our target, not the 
behavior of individual components of the price index. The relatively high level of services 
inflation will be closely monitored in the future, but we have reasons to believe that the 
stickiness in this sector is not abnormal in any way. 
2.2.	 Wages,	costs	and	profits
Wages have been rising gradually to make up for previous losses of purchasing power, 
and in some countries they may rise further. Concerns that this will reignite inflation are 
mitigated by three factors.
First, intermediate costs have fallen significantly, offsetting the impact of wage increases 
on the dynamics of total costs. This mechanism is already at play, and it has contributed 
to a weakening of domestic price pressures: the output deflator decelerated sharply since 
the end of 2022 (Figure 5).
In addition, in recent months firms have not fully passed on the fall in energy and intermediate 
input costs to final prices. As a result, they have accumulated substantial profits, especially 
in some sectors; and it is precisely in these profitable sectors that workers are demanding 
a rapid recovery of past real wage losses.9 This means that, going forward, profits can play 
a buffering role, limiting the pass-through from wage increases to consumer prices.
Finally, since 2021 productivity has been held back by a very intensive use of the labour 
factor, driven by increases in the costs of other production inputs and the decline in 
9 Consider for instance the well-known case of the retail sector in Germany. Wages are expected to rise 
on average by almost 7 per cent in 2024, but profits have increased by over 40 per cent since 2019, from 
110 to 155 billion euros, creating significant shock-absorption capacity. At a more general level, Bank of 
Italy calculations show that aggregate markups (defined as the ratio between the value of production 
and total variable costs) are well above their long-term trends in Germany, France and Italy (Figure A2).

the real cost of labour. Productivity growth is likely to resume in the coming months,  
as labour becomes relatively more expensive, leading to an increase in the capital-labour 
ratio. This will compress growth in unit labour costs and hence consumer prices. 
3.	 The	outlook	for	inflation	and	growth
A careful examination of disaggregated, high-frequency price movements is essential 
to understand inflation dynamics, but there is a limit to the amount of information that 
can be gleaned from raw data alone. Monetary policy is forward-looking; as such, it 
must also rely on an estimate of how inflation is likely to evolve in the medium term.
One way of informing this estimate is to use indicators of ‘underlying inflation’ that 
filter out the noise and cross-sectional heterogeneity in the data and provide a clearer 
signal on common, medium-term inflation trends. Many available indicators of this 
kind show that inflation has been firmly on a downward trend since 2023 (Figure 6). The 
simplest indicator, core inflation, has been on a downward trend too; we should not 
forget that relatively high services inflation has been accompanied by very low inflation 
for non-energy industrial goods. 
Another strategy is to use model-based projections combined with experts’ judgement. 
The Eurosystem’s latest projections show inflation gradually returning to target over 
the medium term, and are thus fully consistent with the underlying inflation indicators. 
In 2022-2023 inflation forecasts took a battering because they were volatile and 
(unsurprisingly) subject to large revisions. However, we are no longer in that situation: 
the projections for 2025 have fluctuated in a narrow range – between 2.0 and 2.2 per 
cent – for more than a year, and those for 2026 have not changed since last December, 
standing at 1.9 per cent.

While our confidence in the disinflation process has grown steadily over time, the 
outlook for economic activity remains fragile. The euro-area economy has been mired in 
stagnation since the end of 2022. The uptick in GDP growth in the first quarter of this year 
may be less reassuring than it appears, given the disappointing figures for consumption 
and business investment. Moreover, GDP is projected to grow by an average of  
1.5 per cent over the next two years – about half a percentage point less than in the last 
expansionary phase.10
4. Monetary policy implications
So where does all this leave us in terms of monetary policy? 
The recent cut in interest rates reflects the observed and expected decline in inflation 
that I have just described. 
Going forward, the pace of monetary policy normalization will continue to be based on 
the assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the 
strength of monetary policy transmission. There may be sporadic unexpected data points 
along the way, but the overall course of monetary policy will not change as long as the 
big picture confirms that we continue to advance towards the target. 
Two elements need to be borne in mind when assessing this baseline. 
First, the transmission of the restrictive monetary policy stance adopted so far is still 
unfolding. Our estimates suggest that the interest rate hikes implemented in 2022-2023 
are still working their way through the economy, and that their impact on inflation may 
be stronger in 2024 than in 2023.11
Second, the effect of any rate cuts is likely to be mitigated by the ongoing contraction 
of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet. This could make the normalization phase different 
from the past, for instance by affecting bank funding costs and credit supply. Indeed, 
the data collected through the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) indicate that the reduction in 
the monetary policy asset portfolio is already having a tightening effect on bank lending 
conditions (Figure 7).
Most importantly, the baseline – no matter how carefully constructed – is only one of 
many possible outcomes. The key lesson of the past four years is that policymakers 
also need to consider alternative scenarios. Allow me therefore to qualify the picture by 
highlighting the main risks that the euro area may face over the medium term.
10 Between 2013 and 2019, GDP in the euro area grew on average by 1.9 percentage points per year. 
Weak growth may partly reflect headwinds coming from the credit market: bank funding costs remain 
onerous, lending rates on new loans are still very high, and loan growth continues to be subdued for 
both firms and households.

at the Inaugural Conference of the Research Network on ‘Challenges for Monetary Policy Transmission 
in a Changing World’, European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 25 April.

One possible risk is another wave of geopolitical shocks. It is now clear that diplomatic 
and military confrontations between countries can have dramatic effects on trade, capital 
flows, growth and prices. 12 Given the current state of international relations, we must 
hope, but certainly not assume, that the global landscape will be more stable in the 
future than it has been over the past two years.
Another risk is an increase in political uncertainty within countries. Some of the world’s 
largest economies have elected or will elect their leaders in 2024, and political turnover 
physiologically translates into policy uncertainty: households and investors need to form 
a view on how incoming governments will handle many critical economic and political 
decisions. It is hard to imagine how this might affect inflation. Uncertainty can disappear 
without consequences. It can trigger capital outflows and currency depreciations, creating 
upward price pressures. But it could also shake confidence and weaken demand, halting 
or even reversing the fragile recovery we have seen so far. In short, we know that we don’t 
know.
Central banks should be prepared to deal with the consequences of such shocks if and 
when they materialize. This implies a readiness to use the full range of tools at their 
disposal to adjust the monetary stance, addressing any threats to price stability, and 
protect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.

5. Conclusions 
Let me conclude.
The euro area has emerged from a ‘perfect storm’, a violent bout of inflation driven by 
a series of large and unpredictable supply-side shocks. Inflation is now on a downward 
path, and many of the issues that we have debated so vigorously in recent months may 
become less important going forward.
The current macroeconomic picture is consistent with a normalization of the monetary 
stance. The ECB duly started this process a few weeks ago and, in the baseline scenario, 
it will pursue it gradually and smoothly. 
In calibrating the normalization we should be data-dependent, taking into account 
incoming information on the macroeconomic outlook without overweighting temporary 
blips in the data. We should also be cautious in our communications, avoiding the ‘casual’ 
forward guidance that can arise from (implicit or explicit) predictions on the timing and 
sequence of future interest rate cuts. Erratic communication would distract attention 
from the key determinant of our monetary policy decisions, namely our reaction function.
Finally, monetary policy requires a management of risks and tail scenarios, not only 
baselines. Political and geopolitical risks remain high, and call for awareness, flexibility 
and state-contingent action plans. Like other central banks, the ECB has been thoroughly 
tested along these dimensions more than once in the last 15 years. The tests were passed 
successfully. They were difficult, but also instructive, and they hold promise for how 
monetary policy will be managed in the future. 
Based on those experiences, I am confident that – barring new upheavals – we will soon 
transition from the saga of the ‘last mile’ to the reality of the ‘first smile’ accompanying a 
full restoration of price stability.
Thank you.
