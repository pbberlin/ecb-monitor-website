Ladies and gentlemen,
Payments and settlement have become more fascinating and more political than ever. 
This is because we are seeing a number of challenging developments at the same time: 
The rapid development of new technologies that many describe as disruptive.
The changing landscape of financial market infrastructures. For example, instant 
payments have been introduced. And we see ongoing endeavours to connect 
existing Financial Market Infrastructures and to expand their services in terms of 
operating hours and functionalities.
The creation of new forms of payment instrument such as crypto-tokens, 
stablecoins and tokenised deposits. Some of these may offer functionalities that 
have not been possible thus far. But they may also entail previously unknown 
risks and partially evade traditional regulation.
The clearly successful entry into the field of transaction banking by market 
participants who have not previously been concerned with payments. These 
include fintech and bigtech companies. The former often bring superior 
technological solutions, while the latter have almost unlimited financial power and 
customer access. Both are able to leap-frog other companies, because they do 
not have to deal with incumbent IT systems.
All of these developments harbour both opportunities and risks at the same time. Let 
me begin by addressing the opportunities. As caretakers of payment and settlement 
systems, we have a great opportunity here: 
New technologies offer the possibility of creating a truly smart economy. An 
economy in which the settlement of contracts is largely automated, supported by 
digital money, distributed ledger technology (DLT) and smart contracts. 
The vision of a settlement environment where goods and services, information 
and money flow synchronously may become a reality.
This could save us time, costs and risks as well as release huge potential for 
growth.
However, a well-balanced assessment also has to take account of the risks. Many 
things could go wrong. We cannot support innovation for innovation's sake alone. Let 

2/2 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
me mention the most important guardrails and guiding principles that we must keep in 
mind:
The anchor role of central bank money must not be weakened. Trust in money requires 
stability of prices. Therefore, we, as central banks, will not accept any developments 
that weaken our ability to implement monetary policy effectively. We will ensure that the 
euro remains the dominating currency here in the euro area. 
Furthermore, the financial stability must not be endangered. That means: First, we have 
to make sure that large-value payments are settled in central bank money. They may 
use but with wholesale central bank digital currenciesSecond, we have  DLT,   (CBDC). 
to ensure that new instruments and new infrastructures cannot create distorted 
incentives that could contribute to potential bank runs or increased market volatility. 
Third, all financial actors must be subject to proper regulation. A level playing field is 
essential in regulation. Our current regulations–be it anti-money laundering (AML), 
countering financing of terrorismprinciples of financial market infrastructures (CFT),   
or anything else–must be applied equally to anyone who provides financial (PFMI), 
services. These are my guardrails and guiding principles.
To conclude, I would like to briefly mention the overwhelming efforts by central banks 
and others towards dealing with these developments and finding the right answers to 
the challenges they present. 
Many central banks are exploring and testing digital forms of money, that is CBDC.  
Many are also discussing new forms of ledgers that could potentially support multiple 
forms of digital money. Central banks are cooperating in a wide variety of technical 
projects organised through theBIS Innovation Hub. Many of us are in almost constant    
exchange with market participants and operators of Financial Market Infrastructures to 
find the best solutions for the future of transaction banking.
And that is why I and many of my fellow central bankers are here today. Please allow 
me to express my appreciation toSWIFT for organising this week of exchange and    
discussion. I am sure that all of us are going to learn a lot. Thank you.
