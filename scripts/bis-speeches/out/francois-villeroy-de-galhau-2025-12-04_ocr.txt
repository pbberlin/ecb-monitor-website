Speech
“Can our tax debate be rational?”
Published on the 27th of November 2025
Symposium marking the 20th anniversary of the CPO - Paris, 27
November 2025
Ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great pleasure for me to open today's symposium dedicated to the
20th anniversary of the Conseil des prélevements obligatoires (CPO) in
our Jacques Delors amphitheater. | would like to pay tribute to the CPO,
which since its creation in 2005 has embodied values that are precious —
and increasingly rare — in the public debate: objectivity, expertise and
independence. The Banque de France fully identifies with these values. |
am familiar with the CPO's requirements, having produced a report for its
predecessor, the Tax Council, in the 1980s, and then having served as
Director General for Taxes.


Allow me to begin with a semantic observation: in English, the word
“fiscal” [which appears in the French title of this symposium: « Notre
débat fiscal peut-il étre rationnel ? »] means “budgetary”, including
spending; in France, it refers solely to taxes. This may be a sign of a
distinctly French passion for taxation, even more so than among our
neighbours. That said, can our tax debate be rational rather than
passionate? Your twenty years of experience invite us to take a long-
term view of taxes and social security contributions in France, with two
perspectives — historical (1) and spatial (2) — and a praise of tax
wisdom (3). | will then conclude with a few remarks on our current
budget debate (4).
1. A historical perspective: a question
of asymmetry
Since the CPO was created in 2005, the rate of taxes and social security
contributions has risen from 42.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) to
42.8% in 2024. This apparent stability masks a certain volatility, with a
significant increase from 2011 onwards and a peak of 45.3% in 2017.
Two-thirds of French citizens consider this level to be too high, while
less than one in three (30%) say they are satisfied with the quality of
public services in relation to the amount of taxes they pay to finance
them.

Consequently, our political debate has often focused on reducing taxes;
over the past 20 years, there have been a large number of unfunded tax
cuts aimed at households — on income tax or housing tax — and
businesses. We must acknowledge that the political or economic
benefits that were expected from these measures rarely materialised.
However, our debate has concentrated much less frequently on
controlling public spending, which amounted to 57.3% of GDP in 2024,
compared with 54.3% in 2005. Our budgetary problem stems first and
foremost from this increase, including the particularly noticeable “ratchet
effect” in France after each crisis — in 2009 and then in 2020 with the
Covid crisis.
We therefore need to focus most of our efforts on spending in order to
achieve fiscal consolidation. Very often, the political debate centres on
central government, which accounts for a large third of public spending,
but local authorities, which account for 20% of the total and social
spending, at 45% of the total, has grown significantly faster over the
past 20 years. Since 2005, the rise in pension spending alone accounted
for more than half of the increase in public spending.
This “non-parallelism” between expenditure and revenue has widened
deficits and led to the continued growth of our public debt. [Slide 3] The
latter has almost doubled as a share of GDP over the past twenty years,
exceeding 113% of GDP at the end of 2024, and it will probably be close
to 116% at the end of 2025.!

2. A spatial perspective
The gap between France and the euro area in terms of taxes and social
security contributions is well Known. In 2024, the rate of taxes and
social security contributions was 42.8% of GDP in France, compared with
38.8% in the euro area excluding France, a difference of 4 percentage
points of GDP.

But one gap can hide another, and in our French illness we too often
confuse the symptom — high taxes — with the cause — spending. Our
country displays the highest level of public spending in the euro area,
along with Finland. The gap in public spending with the euro area
(excluding France) is even greater, at around 9.6 percentage points of
GDP in 2024, which represents EUR 280 billion. This differential reflects
an “efficiency gap”: we share roughly the same European social model as
our neighbours, but it costs us more. In 2023, social protection spending
accounted for two-thirds of this gap, while the remaining third was
attributable to the higher weight of certain sectors (economic affairs,
education).

The cure lies in the quality and efficiency of public spending, which too
often remains the blind spot in our budget debate. The goal is to move
closer to the “efficiency frontier” of public spending, which represents
the ratio between public spending in each area and one or more
international performance indicators. 'V
Let's take a concrete example: in terms of education spending, the order
of magnitude of spending per student is comparable in France and
Finland, while performance — measured by several internationally
recognised “ — is higher among Finnish students. In contrast, Portugal
stands out with a lower level of spending per student than France, with
comparable — even slightly higher — results and clear progress.

We could debate at length about the ideal tax system, its economic
incentives, and its redistributive effects. France has a particular talent for
this kind of debate, with constant tax creativity, especially in autumn. |
have always been very committed to tax fairness and to a fair
contribution from the weathiest. However, | believe it is essential to
remember that seeking the perfect, even magical, tax system is a pipe
dream. Taxation cannot do everything, and genuine tax modesty must be
characterised by three other virtues in addition to fairness:


e Neutrality: a good tax is one that generates revenue without
unnecessarily distorting economic behaviour — VAT, as designed by
Maurice Laure in 1954, is a good example. More generally, it is better
to tax downstream activities and results than upstream activities and
production factors themselves.
e Simplicity: the proliferation of tax loopholes, exemptions, and
derogations must be avoided. The best tax is, in principle, one that
relies on a broad base and a moderate rate. As a simple illustration:
the “practical brochure” on income tax for 2025 contained 85 pages
on tax credits and reductions alone. The draft budget bill for 2026
listed 465 tax expenditures for an estimated amount of EUR 91.8
billion in 2025.
e Stability and predictability: France changes its tax system far too
often from one year to the next, and even during the course of a
single year, with the risk of fostering uncertainty and undermining
confidence. | suggest that taxation be adjusted only once per
legislative term and per tax. A stable and predictable tax system is
more widely accepted and easier to understand for both citizens and
businesses, and is therefore more effective in delivering on the
economic and social intentions of its designers.
4. What does this mean for the
current situation?
Your president, Pierre Moscovici, called the ongoing parliamentary
debate “astonishing.” While | don’t have his talent for adjectives, I'd say
that so far, this debate has been worrying and divisive. It should lower
uncertainty and bring us closer to a budget for 2026, but instead, it is
just adding to the confusion. It should reduce deficits, aim for spending
efficiency, and contribute to fiscal wisdom — which is what French
citizens expect, according to both the barometer presented this morning
and opinion polls — but the discussions have so far led to more
spending, more taxes and more debt, with the all too easy illusion that
“others will pay”: the others being future generations, or hypothetical
deep and painless pockets.


The Banque de France is not, of course, the budgetary authority, and it
is not its place to comment on the details of the measures. But it is
legitimate for it to be concerned about the overall economic balance and
to shed light on the future of our country thanks to the complete
independence of its assessment. France needs a budget, but not just
any budget: the national interest imperatively calls for us to move
beyond the current spectacle to find compromises and adopt a less
short-term view. The persistent successes of our European neighbours
show us the way. In this spirit, | would like to share three simple
convictions:
1. Our country must and can reduce its deficits. We must be ata
maximum of 3% of GDP by 2029, in four years’ time, in order to meet
our European commitments but above all to finally stabilise the debt
burden. The credibility threshold for the next budget is to cover a
quarter of this distance, and thus reduce the deficit to 4.8%.
2. Our country must and can aim to stabilise its total public spending
in volume terms, after taking inflation into account. Looking at our
European neighbours, we can see that this is possible without
jeopardizing either our social model nor our growth. The French
State must set an example, but it cannot do so alone: social and local
spending must be part of an effort shared by all.
3. Our country must and can make taxation both fairer and more
stable. There are obvious measures that can be taken to ensure
fairness: those concerning asset-holding companies, certain tax
loopholes, the tax advantage enjoyed by the wealthiest retirees. As
long as the deficit has not fallen below 3%, targeted and exceptional
measures can be justified, for example, on the profits of large
companies. But for the rest, the wise thing to do is to stop playing
with taxation. We don't have the money to lower taxes, and we don't
have the leeway to raise them. Since fiscal stability is a necessity,
let's also make it a virtue.


| will conclude with La Fontaine. At a conference organised by your
partner institution the High Council of Public Finance, back in May 2022,
| quoted a little-known fable, The Swallow and the Little Birds. “To
instincts not our own we give no credit, and till misfortune comes, we
never dread it”. Having failed to sufficiently anticipate them, we are now
experiencing fiscal woes, and they are severe. And the longer we think
we Can wait, the worse they will get. This is truly no longer the time for
arguing; it must finally be the time for awakening.
