Good morning, 
First of all, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the Swiss National Bank and the 
BIS for inviting me to this highly relevant and timely conference. One of the main challenges 
we are currently facing as policymakers is finding the right adjective to describe the kind of 
uncertainty we are dealing with: extreme, unprecedented, unpredictable? We are navigating 
a very complex policymaking environment characteri sed by a high degree of uncertainty.  
To begin with, let me explain why uncertainty is currently so high. The US Economic Policy 
Uncertainty Index shows that the degree of uncertainty surrounding economic policy in the 
United States is at extreme levels in general, and also in specific areas: monetary policy, 
fiscal policy, regulation, and trade policy.  We are currently experiencing unprecedented 
levels of uncertainty in all of these areas. Trade is a clear example, but fiscal policy in the 
United States is similarly affected. The Congressional Budget Office projects, in the absence 
of new fiscal policies, persistent deficits of over 5% of GDP for the next decade and a debt-
to-GDP ratio rising from 100% to 150%.  
No matter which area you look at, we are facing truly unprecedented developments. This is 
something we must take into account in our decision -making. During the COVID -19 
pandemic, we also faced unprecedented uncertainty, but this time the uncertainty is far 
more of the Knightian kind.1 At that time, the shock, particularly the potential for adverse 
scenarios, was huge, but the direction and the nature of the shock were clear-cut. It was a 
significant negative supply shock. This time around is far more complex. Let me illustrate 
this using a model-based decomposition of shocks  in the recent inflationary episode.2 It 
basically shows that it was possible, even in real time, to identify the nature of the shock as 
clearly supply-driven. 
Today, while the impact on GDP is clearer, the impact on inflation is harder to predict due 
to potentially opposing dynamics.  
I will discuss three key issues arising from this extreme uncertainty and the challenges for 
policymakers in relation to monetary policy. First, evaluation: we need to improve our tools 
and methods to better understand and assess this uncertainty. This involves defining the 
contours of uncertainty and structuring our internal work and decision-making in a way that 
puts more emphasis on the balance of risks to the central scenario . Second, decision-
making: we need to consider how to make decisions in such an uncertain environment. And 
third, communication: we need to consider how to  effectively communicate our decisions 
and the uncertainty to the public and the markets. 
Evaluation 
In the current environment, a central scenario is less informative than in past episodes of 
tension. Instead, we should rely more on well-designed fully-fledged alternative scenarios. 
The adoption of this approach is challenging, but steps were already being taken in this 
 
1 Knightian uncertainty refers to a type of uncertainty where the probability of outcomes cannot be calculated or reliably 
predicted. This concept contrasts with measurable risks, where the outcomes and their probabilities are known or can be 
estimated.

de España Working Paper (forthcoming).

direction even before the recent surge in uncertainty . A relevant example is the 2024 
Bernanke review of the Bank of England’s forecasting3 which puts emphasis on managing 
uncertainty and discussing the balance of risks. In my view, the relevance of this issue is 
going to increase over time, for two main reasons. The first is related to the need to foster 
robustness in response to a situation of uncertainty. In this respect, Sargent and Hansen4 
have clearly explained the importance of robustness in modelling and for potential scenarios 
to deal with uncertainty and model ambiguity. Secondly, we need to improve transparency 
vis-à-vis the public, so that they know we are prepared for different scenarios. This means 
focusing less on the central scenario and more on alternatives. 
All central banks are currently working on scenarios to assess the potential impact of policy 
shifts on tariffs. By way of illustration, at the Banco de España, we use different models to 
analyse past data and predict new economic states if certain events occur. For example, to 
evaluate the impact of the recent trade policy decisions taken by the new US Administration, 
we have combined two models: the well-known large-scale multi-country model NiGEM, 
and a n internal Banco de España  multi-sectoral, multi -country model. Using these two 
models, we have simulated different scenarios  over a three -year horizon , considering 
alternative tariffs configurations in the United States vis-à-vis the rest of the world and in 
the rest of the world vis-à-vis the U nited States. T o better understand the impacts on 
inflation and on the complexity of the situation, we have also added parallel channels that 
might be more demand -driven, such as  negative confidence shocks and financial 
uncertainty and volatility. This highlights the importance of combining different shocks and 
scenarios. As we add more elements, we must choose some to create a simplified view of 
potential new economic states. 
Another key approach when facing an episode of high uncertainty is to monitor short-term 
developments using high-frequency data. This helps us capture early dynamics that lower 
frequency data might miss. For example, during the Valencia floods in Spain, we monitored 
credit card data, ATM withdrawals, employment data, tax data, VAT billing and port data to 
assess the impact. 
Combining numbers with text and other non-structured information is challenging. By using 
neural models and AI techniques, we can detect non-linear patterns and turning points that 
traditional methods might miss. In the presence of high uncertainty, it is crucial to combine 
standard models and forecasting techniques with high-frequency data. 
Decision-making 
Let me turn now to the issue of how to best take monetary policy decisions in a context of 
high uncertainty.  
Here the terms that we normally use, such as data-driven and full optionality, are more 
apposite than ever.  Given the developments in recent months, our initial reaction in the

current situation should be cautious. This is because it  is extremely challenging to predict 
the impact and direction of potential developments  and their net economic effects. 
Therefore, a cautious approach, as suggested by Brainard,5 is appropriate in the short term. 
At the same time, given the rapid pace at which developments evolve, the most likely 
scenario can change swiftly, and alternative scenarios can quickly become the new central 
one. Therefore, we need to act promptly. This requires us to be attentive and prepared to 
make the appropriate decisions. 
In the wording of the recent ECB monetary policy statement, we introduced the concept of 
"agility", highlighting the need to be flexible and responsive. I view the current situation as 
one in which we must balance caution with agility. We need more time to fully understand 
various developments, but we also need to be ready to adapt swiftly. As is often the case 
in monetary policymaking, achieving this balance is an art. 
Communication 
Let me finally deal with the issue of how to communicate our decisions in a context of high 
uncertainty.  
Communicating uncertainty is always a challenge for central bankers. There is a 
fundamental dilemma: if we express too much doubt or present too many alternatives, we 
risk appearing indecisive. Moreover, it is crucial for central banks to be seen as effective 
and committed to maintaining price stability with the necessary tools at our disposal. 
At the same time , the assessment of certain  situations takes time and requires additional 
information. For the sake of transparency, we need to convey this need , but this must be 
done in a way that maintains the perception of our commitment  and avoids appearing 
somewhat lost in the current situation . This is especially challenging in a highly uncertain 
environment. 
Tools like the Bank of England’s fan charts have been used since the mid-1990s.6 However, 
the use of probability distributions can sometimes suggest that anything is possible. This is 
somewhat problematic and it may be difficult for certain observers to understand how these 
charts are constructed and how they should be used. These are factors that limit the 
usefulness of these tools for communication. Similarly, the Federal Reserve Board’s FOMC 
dot plot charts show a range of future views , but they also involve communication 
challenges.7 
If we are moving towards relying more on alternative scenarios rather than a central one, we 
need to communicate this shift effectively. This involves structuring our internal debates and

6 Fan charts were pioneered by the Bank of England back in 1990.  They typically show the likelihood that a future inflation 
outcome falls within a specified range. However, they are silent on the underlying contingencies and policy reaction. 
 
7 The Fed dot plots report the median, central tendency and range across (anonymised) individual FOMC  members. The 
uncertainty range is largely a measure of disagreement across individual members, and there is no mapping between the 
individual FOMC members’ views about inflation, the economy and the interest rate. Thus, preventing inference about the 
implicit reaction function.

discussions on the balance of risks  with styli sed scenarios that reflect a few impactful 
alternatives to the central scenario and have a significant likelihood of materialising.  
The job of the decision-making body is to reach consensus on these alternative scenarios 
and then to instruct staff to develop them in detail, presenting them alongside the central 
scenario. In my opinion, relying more on alternative scenarios is a relatively straightforward 
approach. 
The challenge is how to communicate these alternative scenarios clearly and transparently 
to the public. While transparency is desirable, it can also lead to misinterpretations or 
confusion. The simplicity of a central scenario for projections is straightforward, but as we 
de-emphasise it, we must find effective ways to communicate the shift. 
Transparency is also desirable for our reaction function. Not only when we do (not) react to 
the central scenario, but also to show determination and readiness to react to alternative 
scenarios or to weigh them in our decision-making process, insofar as they are perceived 
as relevant and have a significant likelihood of occurrence. Probably at a certain point in 
time, to manage expectations and provide guidance on understanding the central bank 
reaction function, it would be desirable to move in this direction. 
But at the same time, this is not easy. Imagine how complex it would be to include this in a 
formal statement. We are already sometimes criticised for being overly complex in how we 
communicate our actions and assessments, whether these relate to the economy, inflation, 
or policy decisions. Introducing discussions on alternative scenarios would make things 
even more complex. It could even lead to misinterpretations. A full appreciation that these 
are state-contingency commitments, and not exactly a central scenario, is by no means  
guaranteed. 
An additional source of both complexity and confusion has to do with  the time-varying 
nature of the weight we give to alternative scenarios.  
The appeal of a central scenario with projections lies in its simplicity and 
straightforwardness. However, as we begin to de-emphasise these central scenarios, the 
challenge becomes how to effectively communicate this shift. These are complex questions, 
and while I do  not have all the answers, I firmly believe that more research should be 
conducted on these critical issues. This is shaping up to be a very important debate for the 
future. 
Let me conclude. High uncertainty may become the new normal. Recent unprecedented 
developments suggest that this high uncertainty could be long-lasting. Innovations related 
to AI are accelerating and their impacts are extremely difficult to grasp. In parallel, we may 
be experiencing significant structural changes in the geopolitical landscape, and in political 
decision-making at the global level . As Nobel Prize winner Douglass North wrote 
in Understanding the Process of Economic Change, “it is evident that we have been and we 
are creating societies that are unique in comparison to anything in the past. […] To know 
the future, we have to know today what will be known tomorrow.” Let me complement this 
with another quotation from George Shackle: “What does not yet exist cannot be known.” 
If we are in a new normal of uncertainty, we need to be prepared. This involves developing 

     5  
analytical tools, organi sing internal discussions, and making decisions that account for 
alternative scenarios. Forward guidance may need to be reconsidered, and we must find 
effective ways to communicate uncertainty to the public and markets. 
Thank you very much.
