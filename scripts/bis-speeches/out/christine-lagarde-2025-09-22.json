It signals inquiry rather than prediction, and it frames our goal for the next two days, which is to examine how we can safeguard financial stability in an era of rapid transformation. We must keep two points in mind when thinking about this topic. First, throughout the post-war era, the global financial system has been in constant transformation – and the pace has only accelerated with advances in technology. And second, what appears new often reflects old risks in a different form. Here I am reminded of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff's history of financial crises, \"This Time Is Different\". The book's subtitle, tellingly, is \"Eight Centuries of Financial Folly\". 1 After eight centuries of experience, I think it is fair to say that this time is never different. And that is why research plays such an important role in helping to safeguard financial stability. Through rigorous analysis and a solid understanding of the past, research helps us see how innovation advances and reshapes the economy, while also bringing potential risks into sharper focus so that policymakers can address them proactively. Research is particularly vital in helping us to understand the implications of the profound transformations that have reshaped the financial system since the global financial crisis. One of the major structural shifts in the financial system over the past two decades has been the growing footprint of non-bank financial institutions – the focus of today's first session. In the euro area, non-banks – ranging from investment funds and insurance corporations to money market funds and securitisation vehicles – have expanded from about 140% of GDP in 1999 to close to 400% today. 2 Accordingly, they play an increasingly important role in financing the real economy and in managing the savings of households and firms. Non-banks now account for over 60% of the euro area financial sector. 3 The banking sector – the focus of today's second session – is also operating in a fast-changing landscape driven both by technological innovation and by the emergence of non-banks. For starters, technology challenges banks' business models through the rise of fintechs 4 as well as new innovations like stablecoins if they gain substantial traction. 5 On top of this, technology also amplifies both the speed and scale at which these risks can materialise. The events of March 2023, when three US banks collapsed in five days, highlighted how social media can act as a powerful conduit for panic and contagion 6 – all the more so now that banking services are available on smartphones. 7 The bank and non-bank sectors are not just changing rapidly, they are also highly interconnected. In the euro area, for example, banks' asset exposures to non-banks are considerable and, on average, account for around 10% of significant institutions' total assets. 8 Given these transformations in the financial system, astute supervision and regulation – the focus of the third session, taking place tomorrow at the conference – remains critical. Guided by the insights of cutting-edge research, it is incumbent on policymakers to remain alert to financial stability risks as and when they emerge. These risks may present themselves in new guises, arise in industries well versed in obscure terminology, and be cloaked in the language of innovation. But in substance, the underlying types of risk are often the usual suspects. Non-banks face liquidity and leverage risks, banks face maturity transformation and run risk, and stablecoin issuers face redemption and reserve risks. Europe is sometimes accused of overregulating. But the role of supervision and regulation is not to hold back innovation or structural transformation. On the contrary, it is to contain the risks that may accompany these changes.
