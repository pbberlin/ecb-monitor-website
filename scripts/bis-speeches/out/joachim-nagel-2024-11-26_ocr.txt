1 Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is a great pleasure to be here at Tokyo University. In past weeks, international
observers had been holding their breath in anticipation of the results of the presi-
dential election in the United States. Now we know the outcome.
President-Elect Donald Trump has announced plans to significantly increase tariffs on
a broad spectrum of goods. If the incoming US (United States) administration makes
these promises a reality, this could mark a significant turning point for the interna-
tional system of trade.


However, the election in the United States is just one prominent example of a
broader theme that has recently started to play out on the international stage. After
several decades of increasing global integration, the world has now shifted into a
new phase of what is known as “geoeconomic fragmentation”. As intriguing as this
term may sound, many of us might have different interpretations of what it actually
means.
Rather surprisingly, the first word of that term — “geoeconomics” — actually has a
long history and dates back to the work of political scientist and author Edward
Luttwak in 1990.[1] Back then, Luttwak defined geoeconomics as: “the admixture of
the logic of conflict with the methods of commerce — or, as Clausewitz would have
written, the logic of war in the grammar of commerce.”
He argued that the end of the Cold War marked a shift away from traditional
geopolitical competition, characterised by military and strategic rivalry. In this new
era, he wrote, economic power and commercial competition would become the
primary means of achieving national objectives and exerting influence on the global
stage.
Contrary to Luttwak’s expectations, the world experienced a period of increased
global cooperation after the end of the Cold War, culminating in the creation of the
World Trade Organisation (WTO (World Trade Organization)) in 1995 and China’s
entry into the WTO (World Trade Organization) in 2001. In recent years, however,
this trend has seemingly come to a halt.
To the point, the International Monetary Fund recently defined geoeconomic frag-
mentation as a “policy-driven reversal of global economic integration”.[2]
Geoeconomic fragmentation thus has an overlap with deglobalisation, which also
encompasses non-policy-driven reductions in global integration.[3]
In my speech today, | would like to address geoeconomic fragmentation from three
perspectives. First, | will examine the current extent of geoeconomic fragmentation.
Second, | will explore the implications of increased geoeconomic fragmentation for
central banks. And third, | will discuss how other policy areas can enhance resilience
against geoeconomic fragmentation.
Throughout my speech, | will be taking a primarily European or euro area perspec-
tive. However, given the various similarities between Europe and Japan regarding
their exposure to geoeconomic fragmentation, | will also occasionally refer to the sit-
uation in Japan.


2 Geoeconomic fragmentation: where do we stand?
Allow me to begin by examining the extent of the geoeconomic fragmentation that
we can observe thus far.
First of all, what we can clearly see is that the number of imposed trade restrictions
has risen significantly since 2019.[4] From 2009 to 2019, the Global Trade Alert
database recorded around three thousand new trade restrictions each year. In 2020,
the number of new trade restrictions jumped to six thousand and has remained
largely at this level ever since.
Protectionist measures can take many forms, such as tariffs, quotas or subsidies. A
closer examination of the data reveals that subsidies alone accounted for approxi-
mately two-thirds of the protectionist trade measures implemented between 2020
and 2023. Subsidies not only rose strongly in absolute terms, but their share in
trade-restricting measures also grew.
We have observed an increase in protectionist measures in all of the
G20 (Group of 20) countries, including members of the euro area as well as Japan.
Some of these measures were implemented as sanctions against Russia in response
to its invasion of Ukraine. The most significant increases have been observed in the
United States and China. More specifically, out of all of the protectionist measures
implemented by the G20 (Group of 20) countries, the United States accounted for
around 23 percent and China for 17 percent.
Notably, many of the protectionist measures between the United States and China
are reciprocal. This highlights the risk that each initial increase in protectionism can
lead to a self-reinforcing feedback loop.
Somewhat counteracting this trend towards protectionism, we can also see inten-
tions of deepening trade relationships through regional free trade agreements.
Recent examples include the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (
RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership)), which encompasses Japan
and the economies of the Asian-Pacific region, as well as agreements between the
EU (European Union) and Vietnam, and the EU (European Union) and Singapore.
So, how have these developments impacted flows of global trade thus far? Here, the
picture is mixed.


On the one hand, the degree of global trade integration has not yet changed much
and remains high from a historical standpoint. In 2023, global trade accounted for
58 percent of global GDP (gross domestic product). This was just slightly lower than
the 61 percent recorded in 2008, when global trade integration started to level off.
On the other hand, international trade is regionalising.[5] In particular, while the
United States and China continue to trade with other countries, trade between the
United States and China has declined noticeably.
On the whole, we are witnessing some clear signs of geoeconomic fragmentation.
However, the significance and longevity of this development remain uncertain.
In any case, the euro area and Japan find themselves in similar situations, as they
both have close economic ties to the United States and China, the key players in
recent trade conflicts. In 2023, China and the United States were the main trading
partners for both the euro area and Japan. Furthermore, regarding trade in goods,
both the euro area and Japan are recording trade deficits with China and trade sur-
pluses with the United States.
3 Handling inflationary pressures and inflation volatility
What could an increase in geoeconomic fragmentation mean for central banks and
their goal of maintaining price stability? This is the second perspective from which |
will look at this issue.
3.1 Inflationary pressures
Let me start with inflationary pressures that may affect the medium to long-term
level of inflation. An increase in global integration is usually associated with declin-
ing inflationary pressures.[6]
One important channel through which global integration affects domestic inflation is
the cross-border trade in intermediate goods and services, otherwise known as
global value chains.[7] With the increase in global value chains, countries were able
to specialise in areas in which they had a comparative advantage. As a result, inter-
national trade promoted productivity and economic growth, whilst also dampening
inflationary pressures to some degree. And some studies suggest that this effect has
been particularly pronounced in Japan.[8]
Accordingly, one of the reasons why we should be concerned about geoeconomic
fragmentation is that inflationary pressures might rise if global integration were to
reverse.


How concerned should we be about such a scenario? When considering the risk of
higher inflation alone, | would say not overly.
The main reason for my optimism is that, although empirical studies show that the
effect of global integration on domestic price dynamics is statistically significant, it
appears to be economically small.[9] In other words, while we can be quite sure
about the direction of this impact, its magnitude seems minor. Accordingly, global
integration would have to decrease substantially to cause a noticeable rise in infla-
tionary pressures. And, so far, we have not seen this.
Furthermore, subsidies, which constitute a substantial part of all of the protectionist
measures enacted over recent years, can actually be disinflationary.[10] Of course, a
sudden and drastic increase in trade restrictions, like tariffs, might change the
picture. If one country raised tariffs strongly and the countries affected were to retal-
iate, we could see a significant rise in inflationary pressures.
But, even if we do witness a significant increase in geoeconomic fragmentation
leading to greater inflationary pressures, central banks have all of the tools necessary
to handle a situation like this. Ultimately, for the Eurosystem, a noticeable reduction
in global integration would mean that it would have to set interest rates higher to
keep inflation at bay. The Bank of Japan is certainly also well-equipped to counter
higher inflationary pressures.
Whilst | am sure that we, as central bankers, can cope with potentially greater infla-
tionary pressures, this does not mean that geoeconomic fragmentation is harmless.
Output growth would be lower because we would lose some of the benefits pro-
vided by efficient international division of labour.[1 1]
To give you some numbers: According to IMF (International Monetary Fund) econo-
mists, a mild strategic decoupling would result in a permanent loss of
GDP (gross domestic product) of 0.2 percent globally. However, in a scenario with
severe fragmentation, in which the world would essentially split into two autono-
mous trading blocs, global output losses could rise to as much as 7 percent.|[12]
3.2 Inflation volatility
So far, | have focused on inflationary pressures that could affect the medium to
long-term level of inflation. But what about inflation volatility, which is to say tem-
porary fluctuations in the rate of inflation?


The empirical evidence on how global integration affects inflation volatility is rather
limited. However, recent events clearly show the potential effects, both direct and
indirect.
Especially in Europe, many of us still quite vividly remember when the Russian inva-
sion of Ukraine led to a severe reduction in the supply of natural gas and caused
major disruptions to the international trade of food commodities. This is a clear
example of geoeconomic fragmentation at play.
Compared to Europe, Japan was less reliant on natural gas imports from Russia.
However, as Europe increased its imports of liquefied natural gas
(LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas)), global demand surged, leading to higher costs for
Japan as well. Furthermore, given Japan's heavy reliance on food imports, the
country felt the rise in international food prices particularly strongly.[13]
Of course, higher gas and food prices were not the only cause of the recent spike in
inflation in the euro area, but they certainly played a significant role. In turn, once
European economies had adapted and found new suppliers, falling natural gas
prices contributed significantly to the disinflation process. And so, too, did the nor-
malisation of trade in food commodities.[14]
However, the vulnerabilities extend beyond fossil fuels and food. Other areas that
immediately spring to mind are computer chips and critical minerals, including rare
earths. Sudden disruptions in any of these areas could trigger another inflation
spike.
These vulnerabilities have not gone unnoticed, prompting various policy measures in
both Japan and Europe. Japan has been a frontrunner with its “Economic Security
Promotion Act” .[15] Amongst other objectives, this act aims to ensure stable sup-
plies of critical materials, such as semiconductors and rare earths, and to enhance
the development of specific critical technologies.
The European Union's “Open Strategic Autonomy” initiative intends to reduce
dependencies that pose risks to security.[16] One important aspect of this plan is the
reshoring or “friendshoring” of global value chains. And the “Net-Zero Industry Act”
includes support for green technologies to boost Europe's ability to manufacture
net-zero technologies and their key components.


Both strategies aim to move production in strategically relevant areas to Europe. This
should reduce vulnerabilities to global developments, ultimately lowering the risk of
renewed inflation volatility. However, there is a trade-off here, as Europe itself is
thereby contributing to geoeconomic fragmentation and giving up some of the ben-
efits of the international division of labour. And this may also come at the cost of
greater inflationary pressures.
if geoeconomic fragmentation causes higher inflation volatility, what does that
mean for the Eurosystem or central banks more generally?
A sudden eruption of geoeconomic fragmentation resembles a negative supply
shock that creates a stabilisation trade-off, as inflation rises and output falls. The
mandate of the Eurosystem is very clear: price stability, However, even a central bank
focused solely on price stability cannot completely neglect output. in the euro area,
we operationalise our mandate by aiming for inflation of 2% over the mediurn term.
This allows us to respond flexibly and avoid overreactions that could lead to
destabilisation.
During the recent period of high inflation, we took decisive action to keep medium
to long-term inflation expectations under control. This was crucial, as inflation rates
were guite high during certain months. We tolerated some volatility in inflation, but
without compromising our mandate.
if we see more inflation volatility in the future, it might becorne even more impor-
tant to show strong commitment to achieving our price stability target and stabilis-
ing inflation expectations (17)
4 increasing resilience
As | have hopefully made clear by now, monetary policy can deal with both greater
inflationary pressures and increased inflation volatility. lt is evident that monetary
policy is essential in combatting the inflationary impact of geoeconomic
fragmentation.
However, other areas of economic policy could also help if we see an intensification
of geoeconomic fragmentation. My third and final perspective on geoeconomic
fragmentation concerns exactly this: how can other policy areas enhance resilience?


In terms of trade policy, Europe as a whole should continue to support an open and
rules-based system of international trade. Additionally, Europe should continue to
foster trade agreements with countries seeking mutually beneficial exchange. The
Japan-EU (European Union) Free Trade Agreement finalised nearly seven years ago is
a shining example of this. At the same time, firms need to take measures to increase
the resilience of their supply chains and business models.
When it comes to limiting the volatility of inflation, the obvious elephant in the room
is price caps and subsidies. Several European countries and Japan have implemented
measures like these to handle the large increases in the prices of electricity and
natural gas following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Such measures may be justified under exceptional circumstances, for example, when
inflation increases very quickly and drastically. However, any such measures should
be temporary, targeted at those who really need them, and designed to create the
right incentives. Because, ultimately, they are just a temporary bandage over a large
and deep wound.
In general, they should not be a long-term solution, as they obscure the price signals
that indicate the relative levels of supply and demand, and consequently, the scarcity
of goods and services. For example, Germany’s temporary gas price brake relieved
the burden on citizens and firms, but kept price signals intact, so that the demand
for natural gas was significantly reduced.
In order to make a lasting impact, | see three structural areas that could help Europe
better withstand geoeconomic fragmentation, which | would like to touch on briefly.
First, fostering the transition to a carbon-neutral system of energy production.
Second, strengthening the Capital Markets Union in Europe. And, third, introducing
a digital euro. Allow me to explain my reasoning.
4.1 Fostering carbon neutrality
One way to increase our resilience against geoeconomic fragmentation is to diversify
our sources of energy supply. The transition to a carbon-neutral economy could con-
tribute significantly to this goal. This is because fossil fuels tend to make greater
contributions to inflation volatility in economies that import a lot of oil and natural
gas.[18]


And, in this regard, both Japan and the euro area are heavily exposed: (19) Japan
imports almost all of its olf and natural gas, while the euro area imports the major-
ity. And both regions rely on these fuel sources for more than half of their energy
consumption,
The European Union has already embarked on an arnbitious path of climate protec-
tion, aiming to achieve a net-zero econorny by 2050.(20) And Japan has committed
to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 as well. (21) increasing the production of
renewable energy would also make our economies less vulnerable to global disrup-
tions in fossil fuel prices, which is a very welcome side effect.
Europe could further enhance ffs economic resilience and energy security by inte-
grating its power grids more closely, thereby facilitating more efficient distribution of
energy. This way, hydropower stored in Norway can temporarily step in when the
winds don’t blow in the North Sea or the sun doesn't shine in southern Europe.
Shifting frorn fossil fuels to renewable energy requires significant additional invest-
rent, as parts of the existing capital stock need replacement. Under what is known
as the “Fit for 55" policy scenario, the European Commission estimates that, com-
pared to the average of the years 20171 to 2020, annual clirnate protection invest-
ments need to increase by €477 billion by the end of 2030.[22)
This additional investment right increase inflationary pressures during the transition
ohase. However, as | arqued earlier, the Eurosystem can manage this.
4.2 Completing the Capttal Markets Union
A second way to make the euro area more resilient against geoeconomic fragmenta-
tion in a wider sense is to complete the Capital Markets Union in Europe. Given that
many of you are probably not closely familiar with this topic, allow me to provide
same broader context.
The European Capital Markets Union has its origins in the global financial and
European debdt crises. In the aftermath of these crises, banks in several euro area
member states struggled with large volumes of non-performing loans. This situation
made it difficult for banks to provide enough lending to firms. it also highlighted
Europe's strong reliance on banks for external financing. Consequently, European
policymakers envisioned the Capital Markets Union as Europe’s effort to improve
pan-European capital market funding.


Let me Hlustrate this with some data.[23) At the end of 2008, debt securities
accounted for just 3 percent of liabilities armong non-financial corporations, while
shares listed on a stack exchange comprised around 15 percent. 15 years later, the
share of capital market financing has hardly increased at all: debt securities now
account for 3.5 percent, and listed shares for nearly 16 percent.[24)
For comparison, the share of debt securities in Japan is around 4 percent. in the
United States, which is often seen as a prime example of a market-based financial
system, listed shares accounted for a substantial one-third of non-financial corpora-
tions’ Habilities, while debt securfties cornprised around 7 percent.
What would be the benefits of a cornpleted Capital Markets Union?
On the one hand, it would help to distribute the macroeconomic and financial con-
sequences of gececonomic fragmentation if euro area countries are hit asymmetri-
cally. Bank lending is predominantly national and, in some cases, even regional or
local. By contrast, capital market financing can be cross-border, thereby spreading
the risks of a sector or region that is particularly strongly affected by geoeconamic
fragmentation to a much broader investor base.
On the other hand, it would help to mobilise financial resources to finance invest-
ment in digitalisation, infrastructure and growth opportunities more generally. This
would boost our growth potential and make the monetary policy stabilisation trade-
offs arising from inflation spikes caused by geoeconomic fragmentation more bear-
able, And it would, of course, also help to finance the transition to a carbon-neutral
economy.
What still needs to be done? | see three main areas of improvement.
First, firms need better access to venture capital in particular and equity in general.
European firms certainly do not have a lack of innovative ideas. However, they often
face challenges in turning these ideas into marketable products. This is where
venture capital investors can be especially helpful.
Second, the securitisation market should be revitalised. Securitisations serve as an
ideal bridge between banks and capital markets. A transparent and high-quality
securitisation market would enable banks to transfer portions of their loan portfolias
to the capital market. This process distributes loans and the associated risks more
broadly. Additionally, it would also free up lending capacity for additional loans. At
the same time, we must ensure that we regulate the risks appropriately and avoid
any negative impact on financial stability.


Third, insolvency laws should be harmonised. In the EU (European Union), with its
27 Member States, there are essentially 27 different insolvency laws. An effective
and harmonised insolvency regime would have two significant effects. On the one
hand, harmonisation would facilitate cross-border investment, as investors would
have a better understanding of the associated risks, thereby broadening the investor
base. On the other hand, improving its effectiveness would expedite insolvency pro-
ceedings, facilitating the reallocation of scarce resources to innovative firms striving
to build a digital and carbon-neutral future.
4.3 Introducing a digital euro
A third way of promoting European resilience against geoeconomic fragmentation in
the financial sphere would be to introduce a digital euro.
Currently, digital payments in the euro area often rely on non-European companies,
making Europe vulnerable to geoeconomic fragmentation in the international pay-
ments system. By contrast, the digital euro, as currently envisaged, would be built
on exclusively European infrastructure. Consequently, the digital euro would
strengthen Europe's strategic autonomy and increase its resilience.
But this is, of course, not the only reason in favour of the digital euro. The digital
euro would also be a digital complement to cash at a time when payments are
becoming increasingly digital. This would enable people living in the euro area to
hold central bank money in digital form.
Furthermore, the digital euro would provide the highest possible level of privacy, sur-
passed only by cash, since the Eurosystem is simply not interested in collecting and
commercialising individual customers’ payment data.
And, finally, the digital euro could be used to pay in every corner of the euro area,
both online and offline, offering an unprecedented degree of universal acceptance
and usability.
In November 2023, we entered what is being termed the preparation phase, laying
the groundwork for how the digital euro could be designed. However, a final deci-
sion on issuing a digital euro has yet to be made.
5 Conclusions
The global landscape has clearly changed in recent years. A world once charac-
terised by multilateralism and global cooperation has slowly shifted towards con-
frontation and fracture.


The first signs of geoeconomic fragmentation are becoming increasingly evident.
And, unfortunately, we may be on the brink of significant escalation. This is a con-
cerning development, and we should all strive to restore cooperation and free trade.
But, even if international tensions should intensify: Central bankers have all of the
tools needed to address greater inflationary pressures or increased inflation volatility
resulting from geoeconomic fragmentation. We can and will do what is necessary to
maintain price stability.
And other policy areas have various tools to enhance the resilience of our economies
against geoeconomic fragmentation, some of which | have outlined today. With this
in mind, | am confident that we will find the best way in the coming years — as
central banks, but also as societies.
Or, in the words of the famous Japanese manager Konosuke Matsushita: “The
untrapped mind is open enough to see many possibilities, humble enough to learn
from anyone and anything, forbearing enough to forgive all, perceptive enough to
see things as they really are, and reasonable enough to judge their true value.”[25]

remaining countries join one of the two groups depending on the strength of
their trade links with either the United States or China, resulting in zero trade
with the respective other group. The lower bound in the scenario with severe
fragmentation is 1.9%. The large range is the result of different assumptions
regarding plausible values for trade elasticities.
