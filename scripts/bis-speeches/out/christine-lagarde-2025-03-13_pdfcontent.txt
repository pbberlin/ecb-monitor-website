SPEECH
A robust strategy for a new era
Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the 25th ECB
and Its Watchers conference organised by the Institute for Monetary
and Financial Stability at Goethe University Frankfurt
Frankfurt am Main, 12 March 2025
Paul Valéry wrote that “the trouble with our times is that the future is not what it used to be”.
Our expectations have indeed been swept aside in the last few years, and in the last few weeks in
particular.
Established certainties about the international order have been upended. Some alliances have become
strained while others have drawn closer. We have seen political decisions that would have been
unthinkable only a few months ago.
The level of uncertainty we are facing is exceptionally high.
An index of trade policy uncertainty currently stands at close to 350, more than six times its average value
since 2021.[ ] And indicators of geopolitical risk stand at levels not seen since the Cold War, outside of
wars and major terrorist attacks.[ ]
This new environment raises fundamental questions for monetary policy. How can we deliver price stability
in a new geopolitical era?
Our strategy assessment is ongoing, as you know, and I will naturally not cover every issue in my speech
today. I will focus on the factors I consider to be particularly relevant in this new era.
I will ask three questions: how is the environment in which we operate changing? What do these changes
imply for our reaction function? And what do the changes imply for our policy communication?
My main message is that in an environment of uncertainty, a strong commitment to maintaining price
stability over the medium term is more important than ever.
This commitment will require agility to respond to new shocks, albeit within a well-defined framework that
limits short-sighted reactions and unbridled discretion.
As a result, we will need to continue steering the public’s expectations. People will be looking to us – and
other policymakers – to understand how we will navigate this more volatile era and help reduce, rather
than amplify, uncertainty.
So, agility needs to be combined with clarity. Even when we cannot provide certainty about the rate path,
we can provide clarity about our reaction function.

The environment
When we last reviewed our strategy, the main challenge we faced was a prolonged environment of too-low
inflation. Although the review provided lessons that are relevant under any circumstances, its main focus
was on understanding the causes of too-low inflation and how to ensure that it did not become embedded.
The environment we are facing now is a different one. Three key changes stand out.
First, the direction of shocks is much harder to predict.
In the decade before our last strategy review, we faced a range of structural and cyclical forces that were
almost uniformly disinflationary. Now, we are seeing notable shifts in the drivers of inflation. 
We still face structural factors like ageing and digitalisation that will probably be disinflationary in the
coming years.[ ] But we are also now facing new, two-sided shocks – mainly linked to trade and defence,
as well as climate change – which can amplify or counteract the existing forces.
Trade fragmentation[ ] and higher defence spending in a capacity-constrained sector could in principle
push up inflation. Yet US tariffs could also lower demand for EU exports and redirect excess capacity from
China into Europe, which could push inflation down.
Second, the size of the shocks to inflation could potentially change.
In the period from the great financial crisis to our last strategy review, we faced some very large negative
shocks to growth. The effect of these shocks on inflation, however, took time to materialise. We saw a
slow-moving downward drift in inflation that eventually seeped into inflation expectations.
But looking ahead, shocks might feed into inflation more directly and increase volatility. And this risk may
be particularly acute for the euro area, as we are highly exposed to some of the new types of shock.
For example, the euro area is very open to trade and part of integrated supply chains. Hence, trade
fragmentation is likely to lead to larger, more disruptive relative price changes.[ ] In a similar vein, the euro
area is highly dependent on energy imports.[ ] Geopolitical risks are likely to drive greater volatility in
exchange rates and energy and commodity prices, as we have seen in recent weeks.
Third, if the shocks do become larger, the persistence of inflation could in some circumstances be greater.
One feature of the recent inflation shock was an increase in the frequency of price changes.[ ] This can
lead to a steepening of the Phillips curve and, more generally, to a proportionally stronger impact of large
shocks on inflation. A model developed at the ECB suggests that inflation behaves in a visibly non-linear
way: it reacts disproportionately more strongly to large shocks, whereas small shocks trigger no significant
reactions.[ ]
If such state-dependent pricing becomes standard when the economy is hit by large shocks, but the
frequency of wage-setting remains below that of price adjustment, we could see inflation becoming more
persistent.[ ] Large shocks would lead to a faster pass-through to inflation, and then wages would have to
catch up with prices in a staggered way.

As an illustration, energy inflation peaked in October 2022, while services inflation only peaked in July
2023 and is still being pushed up by past shocks today, mainly through their delayed impact on wage
adjustments.
In this environment of more uncertain, larger and possibly more persistent shocks, the way we have
formulated our inflation target matters – that is, we aim for 2% inflation, our target is symmetric and we
work to achieve it over the medium term.
This symmetric target has served us well during the recent inflation surge, helping to coordinate
expectations and guide the inflation process back down towards 2%.
But the formulation does not mean that headline inflation will always be at 2%, which is impossible in the
kind of environment we are facing now. It means that, regardless of the shocks we face, we must set our
policy appropriately so that inflation is always converging back towards 2% over the medium term.
So, how can we do that? This brings me to the second area: the reaction function.
The reaction function
Our reaction function has always been state-dependent. In other words, policy should react differently
depending on the context and the origin, size and persistence of shocks.
Our medium-term orientation enables us to avoid reacting to small or passing shocks that will have faded
by the time the effects of a policy change kick in. And it allows us to flexibly adjust the horizon within which
we must return inflation to target.
Classically, monetary policy reacts more forcefully to demand shocks where output and inflation move
together, and “looks through” or reacts less to supply shocks that push output and inflation in opposite
directions – if they are sufficiently small and transitory.
Empirical evidence based on the last two decades finds that the ECB has largely followed this
prescription. Generally, it has reacted more strongly to demand shocks than to supply shocks. But it has
responded to supply shocks more forcefully when these shocks were persistent and inflation was high.[ ]
The new environment requires us to emphasise two factors.
The first is the anchoring of inflation expectations.
For the ECB, “looking through” has always been conditional on inflation expectations remaining well
anchored. The recent inflation surge has confirmed just how critical maintaining a strong anchoring is to
successfully navigate a more volatile world.
Our analysis finds that, if inflation expectations had been as poorly anchored as they were in the 1970s,
policy rates would have had to rise to 8% at the peak of the recent tightening cycle to tame inflation, with
very high costs for the economy. With well-anchored expectations, recent disinflation has instead been
achieved at a relatively low cost compared with similar episodes in the past.[ ]

This experience can, in some ways, give us confidence for the challenges ahead: the relative stability of
longer-term inflation expectations during a massive inflation surge suggests that our inflation target has a
high degree of credibility, which was reinforced by the decisive actions we took to keep inflation
expectations anchored.[ ]
At the same time, our starting point for the recent inflation episode was a decade of too-low inflation and
correspondingly subdued inflation expectations. This meant the public were initially inattentive to inflation
and took time to update their views.
But there is some evidence that public awareness has been awakened by recent experience. Once
consumers took notice of rising inflation, their inflation perceptions responded quickly but reduced more
sluggishly when inflation started to fall. This sluggish response has contributed to the slow adjustment of
consumer inflation expectations, especially one year ahead.
We will only know through careful observation how long these memories will last, and consequently how
sensitive inflation expectations will be to new shocks. But in all scenarios, close monitoring of inflation
expectations – across markets, analysts, forecasters, households and firms – will be central to our policy
reaction function.
Once the anchoring of inflation expectations is assured, the second factor we need to assess is how the
current environment affects the optimal policy reaction to different type of shocks.
If the Phillips curve becomes steeper at higher levels of inflation, meaning inflation responds faster to
changes in activity, then it should also be easier for monetary policy to bring inflation down without
imposing heavy costs on the economy. This would weaken one of the main rationales for “looking through”
large supply shocks.[ ]
At the same time, there may be risks in generalising from recent experience where disinflation was
relatively painless.
Alongside well-anchored inflation expectations, the relatively low “sacrifice ratio” during this disinflation
episode may reflect a unique set of conditions that will not be applicable to future shocks. In particular, the
fact that we faced a series of negative shocks to income reduced the extent to which demand needed to
be dampened by monetary tightening.[ ]
Any future shocks we face – such as energy price shocks and supply chain disruptions or a large increase
in spending on defence or infrastructure – will therefore have to be assessed through this framework.
All told, simple policy prescriptions will not be appropriate in the environment we now face. Within a well-
articulated strategy and an unwavering commitment to price stability, we will need to retain agility to
respond to complex circumstances as they arise.
This has implications for our policy communication, which brings me to the third area.
Policy communication

Maintaining agility affects how we can talk about the future. And this applies particularly to our ability to
give detailed guidance on the future path of interest rates.
Forward guidance about the rate path is particularly useful under two circumstances.
First, when the economy is faced with one-sided, persistent shocks pushing it towards the effective lower
bound. In this setting, it gives the public confidence that monetary policy will be sufficiently persistent to
dislodge those shocks and deliver on its target, while also helping insulate monetary conditions from
spillovers from abroad.
These benefits were all visible in the euro area from 2013 onwards when we first introduced rate forward
guidance.
Second, forward guidance can be useful when shocks become two-sided following a long time at the lower
bound. In this case, it can help to lay out the conditions for rate lift-off in a way that hedges against false
positives and prevents a premature tightening, and thereby reduces uncertainty about the future path of
rates.
However, one of the lessons of the recent period is that such guidance can become less helpful when
uncertainty about the nature of the shocks is rising. In particular, some of the lift-off criteria we applied to
our 2021 rate forward guidance were tied to the baseline inflation projections, but the projections were
slow in catching on to the reality of a much more persistent inflation shock.
The combination of factors that created this shock – a worldwide pandemic producing bottlenecks in
various sectors upon reopening and a major energy crisis – had not been seen since the end of the World
War One. But with hindsight, it would have been beneficial in our forward guidance to explicitly account for
the risks and uncertainty surrounding the baseline.
A general conclusion emerges: when the size and distribution of shocks becomes highly uncertain, we
cannot provide certainty by committing to a particular rate path. Otherwise, forward guidance may
constrain policy agility in the face of abrupt changes to the inflation environment.
But we can provide clarity about our reaction function. We can still help the public to understand how we
will navigate the new environment.
First, we can clarify how we are likely to be affected by different states of the world.
Since the pandemic, the ECB has been making greater use of scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis
precisely to make our policy more robust to changing circumstances. These exercises, together with our
discussion of the balance of risks, are designed to ensure that policymaking can remain forward-looking
and stay ahead of the shocks to come.
At present, we are considering various scenarios related to tariffs and fiscal policy changes, and what they
will imply for growth and inflation.[ ]
Second, we can clarify what kind of data we will look at to make our decisions, which helps the public to
distinguish signals from noise. This is why in March 2023 we set out three key inputs for policy decisions:
15

the inflation outlook – comprising both the baseline and risks around it – the dynamics of underlying
inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
In the early phase of our rate tightening, before these criteria were introduced, we saw large monetary
policy shocks – linked both to rate decisions and indications on future rates – as markets were looking for
orientation. But after March 2023, market moves were less pronounced despite similar levels of interest
rate uncertainty, which suggests that the markets better understood our reaction function.
We also saw increased sensitivity to new data releases in the early tightening phase. But this diminished
as markets understood which data we were focusing on and, especially, that data dependence should not
be confused with “data-point dependence”.[ ]
The lesson I draw is that laying out a clear reaction function is critical to tempering volatility in a world of
exceptional uncertainty. The public must understand the distribution of possible outcomes ahead and how
the central bank will react once it is sufficiently confident about which scenario it is facing.
In this way, clarity on the reaction function can be seen as providing framework guidance – i.e. a type of
guidance that comes from the discipline implicit in a monetary policy framework – without pre-committing
to any particular rate path, as the latter would excessively constrain agility.
The three inputs we are currently using are designed to deliver robust policy in the face of the particular
constellation of shocks that have hit the euro in recent years, especially the staggered pass-through of a
large inflation surge to wages. Whether we continue to use those same inputs in future will depend on the
nature of the shocks that confront us.
Our strategy assessment should nonetheless commit to integrating risk and uncertainty about key factors
into our reaction function. The data we draw on should capture not only our central projection for the
economy, but also the uncertainty surrounding that projection and a rich, diverse set of risks.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Thomas Jefferson said that “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty”. The same can be said of stability.
Maintaining stability in a new era will be a formidable task. It will require an absolute commitment to our
inflation target, the ability to parse which types of shocks will require a monetary reaction and the agility to
react appropriately.
Our response to the recent inflation episode should give the public confidence that we will always do
whatever is necessary to deliver price stability – and that our policy frameworks can adapt to new
circumstances.
Central bankers will need to show agility to adjust their stance and their tools to changing circumstances,
and they will need intellectual curiosity to challenge established principles and conventional wisdom.

In addition, there needs to be clarity that the central bank will respond appropriately in the event of large
market disruptions. The ECB has a strong track record in providing liquidity during financial stress
episodes and has two backstop instruments in its toolkit (the Outright Monetary Transactions and the
Transmission Protection Instrument). In turn, investor confidence in the liquidity policies and backstop
instruments of the ECB acts as a self-stabilising force by limiting incentives to “run for the exit” during
stress periods.
