 accompanying the speech Presentation
Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,
May I warmly welcome you to Helsinki and to our annual research conference, which 
the Bank of Finland organizes jointly with the Centre for Economic Policy Research.
May I also say that taking inflation and monetary policy as the theme of the conference 
has proved to be a pertinent and productive tradition. But this was not always self-
evident, as times have changed.
Just a few years ago, high inflation would have sounded like ancient history. However, 
as we know only too well, the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent geopolitical 
tragedies have proved that inflation can return, unexpectedly and significantly, and that 
central banks must stand ready to tackle it purposefully.
The surge in inflation and the robust disinflationary measures taken by the European 
Central Bank and other central banks remind us how important it is that central bankers 
and academics listen and talk to each other.
In fact, the timing of this dialogue opportunity today is particularly appropriate, as I 
returned home only yesterday evening from the Governing Council meeting in 
Frankfurt, where we took our latest interest rate decisions.
So let me devote the first part of my talk to the current economic outlook and our 
monetary policy decisions. I will then turn to a more bird's-eye view of the past few 
years regarding inflation. Finally, I shall say a few words about the ECB's assessment 
of its monetary policy strategy.
Slide 2: Disinflation in the euro area is on the right track
Inflation  or, rather, disinflation  in the euro area is on the right track. We've come down 
from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 and are now in the vicinity of our 2% medium-
term target. The latest Eurostat estimate, for August, shows an inflation rate of 2.2% in 
the euro area.
While the final stretch of the road to our 2% target may be bumpy, the ECB and other 
international institutions forecast that the 2% target will be achieved in a sustainable 
way in the course of next year.
Slide 3: Euro area GDP growth is projected to gradually pick up

2/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Growth, however, remains slow in the euro area, and downside risks to growth have 
increased over the summer. Industrial production in the euro area is still stumbling after 
the energy price shock and is not expected to recover quickly. According to the ECB 
staff forecast published yesterday, growth in the euro area this year will be subdued, 
but will then accelerate to 1.3% in 2025 and to 1.5% in 2026. Geopolitics, including two 
wars and other political uncertainties, is strongly influencing the growth and inflation 
outlook for the euro area, both in the short and medium run.
It has become evident that the weakness in euro area growth is more structural than we 
had previously thought. Europe must, in my view, pursue stronger productivity growth, 
not least since its populations are ageing, green investments require massive funding, 
public debts and deficits are large and defence spending needs to be raised.
These developments call for a strong, unified response from the EU. This is the main 
message from former ECB President Mario recent Draghi's   report on EU 
. The report highlights three key areas for action: 1) closing the R&D competitiveness
and innovation gap with the United States; 2) balancing Europe's ambitious climate 
goals with competitiveness; and 3) enhancing security and reducing critical 
dependencies.
The report is a wakeup call to all Europeans and a deep diagnosis of our economic and 
industrial challenges. I do hope it catches the attention it deserves from both the new 
European Commission and the EU national governments.
Slide 4: The ECB's Governing Council lowered key interest rates at its September 
meeting
At the ECB's Governing Council meeting yesterday, we decided to lower our main 
policy rate by 0.25 percentage points, meaning that the deposit facility rate now stands 
at 3.5%.
There were good reasons for easing monetary policy: inflation has continued to slow 
down, and inflation expectations are close to the ECB's 2 percent target. In addition, 
economic activity is still subdued, and financing conditions remain restrictive.
Disinflation, together with robust wage growth, is supporting the growth of real 
disposable incomes in the euro area and paving the way for a consumption-led 
recovery. Our Achilles' heel, though, is the low level of productive investment.
Concerning productive investment – that we badly need – the distinction between 
structural and macro is never crystal-clear, black-and-white. Yes, the current clouds of 
geopolitics and intra-European uncertainty weigh on the European economy, in the 
form of damaging confidence effects. Nevertheless, and to paraphrase a certain giant 
on whose shoulders we all stand: "In the long run we are all retired. But in the 
meantime, we need more productive investment."
In other words, even though the euro area's longer term growth and competitiveness 
challenges cannot be solved using monetary policy, an easing in financial conditions 
will bring welcome relief to households and companies in the short term, and should 
support investment, which is needed to increase longer term productivity.

3/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The prevailing uncertainties continue to underline the case for data dependency and a 
meeting-by-meeting approach in the Governing Council's decision-making going 
forward. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
We thus maintain full freedom of action and flexibility in making interest rate decisions 
in future meetings. The next regular monetary policy meetings will be held in October 
and December.
The Governing Council will continue to base its monetary policy decisions on the 
assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the 
strength of monetary policy transmission.
Slide 5: Three periods of inflation in the euro era, 1999-2024
Let me now turn to the ECB's assessment of its monetary policy strategy by taking both 
a step back and a longer term perspective.
This graph shows that the quarter-century history of euro area inflation can be 
conveniently divided into three distinct periods: 1) 'normal times', during what later 
became largely known as the Great Moderation, from the 1980s until 2009 (inflation at 
2.2% on average); 2) 'lowflation' in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (inflation 
at 1.3% on average); and 3) 'highflation' since 2021 (inflation at 5.8% on average).
Each of these periods had a specific set of drivers, shocks and policy challenges. In 
spring 2020, the ECB launched its previous monetary policy strategy review, motivated 
by persistent sub-target price dynamics, the binding policy rate constraint and the need 
to evaluate the unconventional monetary policy toolkit. Estimates of the natural rate of 
interest were at that time pointing to a declining downward trend, and there was 
growing evidence of a flattening of the Phillips curve, although with apparent non-
linearities.
All these factors together posed a risk that the central bank could have lost the 
necessary policy space and, equally worryingly, that inflation expectations could 
become de-anchored.
What cause inflation? Demand or supply shocks?
Given the commitment to reassess its actions regularly, the ECB decided this summer 
to launch an assessment of its monetary policy strategy, with the aim of completing it in 
mid-2025.
What has changed since the previous review in 2020? No sooner had the ink of the 
previous review dried in July 2021 than inflation started to rise rapidly. Clearly, 
understanding the nature of the inflation surge is of paramount importance – and a key 
lesson to be learnt.
Let me elaborate a bit.
One view holds that the surge in prices can be mainly attributed to factors that were 
constraining . For example, the pandemic-related lockdowns across the world  supply

4/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
heavily disrupted international production and transportation chains, resulting in multi-
month delays in the supply of manufactured goods. The same lockdowns reduced or 
even temporarily eliminated the supply of many services, for instance in the leisure 
industry. The pandemic also led to a massive drop in average hours worked, creating 
labour shortages and further squeezing supply.
On top of that came a textbook or, rather, .  supply-side shock   a relative price shock
When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, global oil and gas prices shot up. 
Within a few months the euro area was largely cut off from Russian natural gas supplies 
and was instead increasing its natural gas imports from the US, Norway and Africa, 
which added to the energy bill and economic costs.
But could also have been at play, as acknowledged by Chair  demand-shifting factors 
Powell at this year's Jackson Hole keynote speech. Research presented at this year's 
ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra also points in this direction. One potential 
factor was the strong level of pent-up demand following the pandemic lockdowns.
People not only consumed less and accumulated more savings during the pandemic, 
but demand also shifted from services to goods. Once the lockdown restrictions had 
been eased and lifted, the vaccines rollouts made and health security improved, there 
was a demand overhang and a surplus of savings that together boosted private 
consumption.
Secondly, advanced economies introduced both fiscal and monetary stimulus measures 
on an unprecedented scale, with the objective of boosting domestic demand. 
Expansionary fiscal policy was especially pronounced in the United States.
Central banks also stepped in with various stimulus programmes. For instance, the 
ECB launched the PEPP asset purchase programme worth 1,850 billion euro in total. 
The Federal Reserve, apart from dropping the policy rate to zero, embarked on a wide 
range of asset purchase and loan programmes.
On top of that, both the Fed and the ECB made fresh changes to their respective 
monetary policy strategies. In both cases, the original goal had been to lift inflation from 
the deflationary mire where we had been for too long, with the aim of achieving a slight 
upward shift in inflation expectations.
It therefore transpired that many of the potential factors contributing to high inflation, 
including demand shifts, fiscal and monetary policy measures, energy shocks and 
supply chain disruptions, all happened around the same time.
This concurrence of various economic forces apparently makes life more difficult for 
researchers who try to analyse the causes of the inflation surge, because it amplifies 
the perennial identification problem. So, the jury is still out, and researchers are busy 
trying to disentangle these factors and develop new tools for identification and analysis.
These demand-supply interactions are rightly a part of this year's Bank of Finland and 
CEPR joint conference, for example the papers and discussions from yesterday's 
fascinating session on large shocks. They are also likely to be among the issues 
considered in . the next ECB strategy assessment in 2025

Slide 6. Reflections on the ECB's next strategy review in 2025
The most important decision of the ECB's previous strategy review, in 2021, was to set 
a symmetric inflation target of 2% over the medium term. This means that both negative 
and positive deviations from the target are now treated as equally undesirable. We also 
underlined the medium-term orientation for reaching the target.
This redefined inflation target, in place since 2021, has provided a clear and 
comprehensible anchor, and enough flexibility both in terms of the temporal definition 
and the instruments used. This has allowed us to avoid taking any excessively drastic 
measures that the old target might have implied.
Thus, the target itself does not, in my view, need re-consideration. But in the strategy 
assessment we need a better understanding of the inflation dynamics of the past few 
years and of the secular trends affecting monetary policy going forward. These include 
geopolitics and other drivers of the natural rate of interest.
Geopolitical challenges and geoeconomic fragmentation, in particular, will continue 
to shape the operating environment of monetary policy in the years ahead. Complex 
value chains are no longer seen only as a sign of economic progress, efficiency and 
peaceful cooperation, but also as a potential source of risk and economic disruptions.
The changes that are taking place in the world economy, from trade wars to supply 
chain diversions, are likely to increase the probability of supply shocks and inflation 
volatility. They will also importantly shape the new equilibrium of the euro area economy 
that emerges after the current interest rate cycle.
Turning to the natural rate of interest, there are arguments supporting the view that it is 
rising – as a result of the huge investment needs due to the green transition, artificial 
intelligence and defence spending – but there are also arguments for the view that it is 
declining – due to weakening productivity growth arising from population ageing and 
geoeconomic fragmentation. The true picture is still largely unknown and requires 
considerable further research.
Another focus area in the strategy assessment should, in my view, be .  labour markets
We need a more concrete understanding of how demographics affect the participation 
rate and labour force trends.
In recent years we have seen a sharp decrease in average hours worked during the 
pandemic and increased immigration, which has enlarged the labour supply and helped 
to constrain wage pressures.
We need to ask ourselves whether these trends are likely to continue and such shocks 
likely to reoccur. And what is their impact on labour productivity in the short and longer 
term?
Conclusions
Ladies and Gentlemen,

6/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Let me finish with a few conclusions.
The latest inflationary episode was the largest in 40 years. This, and the subsequent 
disinflation, offer us a wealth of new empirical raw material to learn from and for re-
examining the analytical and historical knowledge we gained from Volcker's disinflation 
in the early 1980s.
Nevertheless, the paths of real and nominal interest rates and the ultimate dynamics of 
prices have this time been, to some extent, different. Obviously, the world has also 
undergone profound structural changes in the meantime, which makes simple 
analogies tricky. Even so, careful comparison and analysis of these two inflation 
episodes and their differences may improve our understanding of economics.
Let me add that there are many reasons to assume that the supply side of the economy 
is and will likely continue to be a source of shocks with inflationary implications. Climate 
and weather, energy and geopolitics, production chains, labour market and new 
technologies can all be sources of major disruptions and accelerate structural change.
This is of paramount importance for another reason too, namely that our traditional 
analytical tools, such as the New Keynesian framework, are typically better suited to the 
study of demand disruptions. Thinking more about the supply side may be tougher but 
is no less important.
Thank you.
