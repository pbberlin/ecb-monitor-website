SPEECH
Opening remarks
Welcome address by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board
of the ECB, at the Joint ECB-IMF-IMFER Conference 2024
Frankfurt am Main, 23 July 2024
| am pleased to welcome you to this research conference, jointly organised by the European Central
Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the IMF Economic Review. The focus of this
conference on new global challenges for international fiscal and monetary policy is directly relevant to
the work of the ECB. Policy institutions rely on academic research for the analytical foundations that
guide our economic and financial assessments and our policy decisions,
In looking at the programme for this conference, | was impressed by the progress that is evident
across several research dimensions. The combination of methodological developments and the
increased availability of granular data is facilitating much richer analysis and more informative
quantitative estimation of the impact of various types of shocks and, crucially, the impact of various
types of policy measures.4! In particular, it is increasingly feasible to move beyond representative-
agent, representative-product macroeconomic models by incorporating various types of heterogeneity.
Heterogeneity matters across many dimensions -— | will list just a few examples. The consumption and
labour supply decisions of households differ across income brackets and lifecycle stages. The
pricing, investment, production and financing decisions of corporations depends on the size
distribution and balance sheets of individual firms. The exposure of a firm to a sectoral shock depends
on the patterns of complementarities and substitution possibilities across sectors, in addition to where
the firm is located in the production network — whether it is upstream or downstream of the affected
sector.4! The vulnerability of a region to an external shock depends not only on direct trade linkages
but also on exposures via integrated supply chains. Similarly, the impact of a financial shock depends
on the nature of the frictions that determine access to finance, together with the network of bilateral
financial linkages that lie beneath the international financial system. Of course, any individual research
contribution will have to focus on the types of heterogeneity that are most relevant for the question
being studied — not all types of heterogeneity are equally important for all shocks.
From my perspective, it is essential that the ECB both supports these research developments and
incorporates the emerging insights into the policy process. In terms of macroeconomic analysis, a
range of multi-sectoral, multi-country and heterogeneous-agent models are in development at the
EcB.&!
In terms of the information set that forms the basis for our monetary policy meetings, surveys are
playing an increasingly prominent role. Typically, these are analysed in combination with bank-level,
firm-level and household-level datasets. The surveys conducted by the ECB are central to the policy
process: the bank lending survey (BLS); the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE);


the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS); the Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS); the
Consumer Expectations Survey (CES); the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA); and the Survey of
Professional Forecasters (SPF).!2! More recently, the European System of Central Banks has
developed the Distributional Wealth Accounts, a dataset that provides new experimental quarterly
statistics on household wealth.
With respect to wages, the newly-developed ECB wage tracker is based on granular data on collective
bargaining agreements, allowing the ECB to interpret the latest signals on developments in wages in
the euro area and conduct sectoral analysis that can shed light on the connection between wages and
prices. 2 In addition, micro price data can enhance our understanding of how firms set prices. 2 The
analytical and policy value of these surveys and granular datasets is increasing in the breadth and
credibility of research that provides a guide to understanding the macroeconomic impact of
heterogeneity,“2] | am confident that the papers presented at this conference will make a valuable
contribution to advancing this exciting research programme.
The wider availability of timely granular information on balance sheets, millions of individual loans and
their lending rates (for example in the European AnaCredit credit register) and deposit rates for euro
area monetary financial institutions has offered increasingly detailed insights into bank-based
transmission. We now have evidence that firm and bank balance sheet constraints can amplify the
contraction in credit availability brought about by policy tightening. “4 Access to granular survey data,
for example the individual replies to the bank lending survey, also helps disentangle credit supply from
demand to understand the transmission of shocks to the real economy via banks.""2] More recently,
the availability of security-level data as well as loan- and transaction-level information on banks and
firms has further enhanced the analysis of the monetary policy transmission mechanism along several
dimensions, including: heterogeneity in the transmission of monetary policy across regions and
sectors; the impact of monetary policy on bank risk-taking; and the sources of changes in credit
developments. 421441

It is beyond the scope of these opening remarks to review last week’s monetary policy meetings.
However, a set of background slides are available on the ECB’s website.

In the euro area, households in the bottom income quintile spend about 50% of their total expenditure
on rent, food and utilities, double the expenditure share for households in the top income quintile. See

also a topic in the European System of Central Banks ChaMP research network (“Challenges for
Monetary Policy Transmission in a Changing World”). The network is also working on extending
detailed business-to-business production network data to several more euro area countries.
