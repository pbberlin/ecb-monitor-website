SPEECH
Resilience offers a competitive advantage,
especially in uncertain times
Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of
the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the
Morgan Stanley European Financials Conference
London, 19 March 2025
We are living in unprecedented, turbulent times. Not a single week goes by without significant shifts in the
global economy. We are seeing a surge in tariffs, an unravelling of global trade and a growing transatlantic
divide leading to new geopolitical realities, all while wars continue right on our doorstep.
Meanwhile, the debate on financial regulation is also intensifying. Some have raised the question as to
whether regulation and supervision have become too conservative that they may be hindering
competitiveness. Perhaps some of the investors and bankers here in this room are asking themselves the
very same question.
In my remarks today, I will highlight that, particularly in an era of heightened economic uncertainty and
geopolitical shifts, we need competitive banks that ensure the flow of finance into investment and
innovation. I will argue, however, that a vital pre-condition for banks to play their fundamentally important
role of financing the real economy is that they remain resilient. Because a banking system that cannot
withstand shocks cannot reliably finance the economy, especially when it matters most. And while there
are merits in removing undue complexity from the regulatory framework without compromising resilience,
the debate on competitiveness should not be used as a pretext for watering down regulation. Rather than
reducing complexity by lowering regulatory requirements, it would be more effective to achieve
simplification through European harmonisation: don’t cut rules, harmonise them.
Resilience of the European banking sector
Let me start with resilience. Over the past decade European banks have become significantly stronger.
Thanks to robust regulatory guardrails and rigorous supervision, today’s banking sector is far more
resilient than it was ten years ago. This is reflected in higher capital and liquidity buffers, improved risk
management and better governance.
Euro area significant banks are currently in a good financial position, with the aggregate Common Equity
Tier 1 ratio standing at 15.7% in the third quarter of 2024. Similarly, the leverage ratio stands comfortably
above regulatory requirements at 5.8%. I anticipate that the data for the fourth quarter of 2024, due for
release tomorrow, will confirm this overall trend.[ ]1

Liquidity ratios also remain well above regulatory requirements, with the liquidity coverage ratio standing at
158.5% and the net stable funding ratio at 126.9%.

This resilience is not a coincidence, but a testament to the joint efforts undertaken by regulators,
supervisors and banks over the last decade.
It is worth remembering that the strong regulatory and pan-European supervisory framework was put in
place as a response to the great financial crisis, which remains the biggest growth-destroying event in
modern economic history.[ ] The aim of legislators was clear: never again should we let excessive risk-
taking, insufficient regulation and “light touch” supervision fuel another crisis like the one that affected
millions of Europeans and resulted in average output losses of 8.5% of GDP in EU countries.
Encouragingly, Europe can look back on a decade of financial stability. Building on this renewed resilience,
euro area banks are now in a much better position to support households and companies.
To ensure banks can continue to play this crucial role, their ability to earn sustainable profits is an
indispensable component of resilience: without profits, banks cannot organically generate capital, make
the necessary investment in future-proof IT systems, finance their clients’ growth projects and remain
attractive to investors.[ ] Encouragingly, the profitability of euro area significant banks has notably
improved, with the aggregate annualised return on equity (RoE) standing at 10.2% in the third quarter of
2024. Despite this improvement, the positive effect of higher net interest income seems to have already
peaked. Moreover, although banks have seen their return on equity increase, it is still barely higher than

their own cost of equity estimates.[ ] This shows that banks must keep a close eye on their operating
efficiency.
One possible way of improving operating efficiency would be to reap economies of scale. Scaling up
would enable banks to arrive at the investment budgets they need for digitalisation and cybersecurity.
In a highly fragmented European banking system, these economies of scale could also be achieved
through market consolidation. We have repeatedly stressed that from a supervisory perspective, we see
benefits in cross-border mergers and will not stand in the way of consolidation. What matters is that the
acquisition results in safe and sound banks, regardless of who the proposed acquirer is or whether it
concerns a domestic or cross-border acquisition. Our supervisory assessment is limited to the prudential

grounds and criteria laid down in a limitative manner in the law. This means ensuring that new entities
resulting from business combinations have sustainable business models, comply with regulatory and
supervisory requirements and have sound governance and risk management arrangements in place.[ ]
Back in 2021, to be as transparent as possible about our approach for the benefit of market participants,
we published a guide to consolidation in the banking sector clearly setting out our supervisory
expectations.
Risk outlook
Resilience must, however, not lead to complacency. The risk environment is changing in ways that
demand our continued vigilance.
Although euro area GDP growth improved slightly to 0.7% in 2024, it remains subdued. In addition to the
risks to the GDP outlook being tilted to the downside, structural trends are developing that may cause
significant bottlenecks in global and European economies in the period ahead.[ ]
For example, geopolitical tensions are not expected to subside, we are seeing economic fragmentation
along geopolitical fault lines and protectionist measures are growing. And while all of this is happening, the
climate and nature crises – although lately it seems less fashionable in certain circles to point out this
undeniable fact – are getting worse, and natural disasters are becoming ever more frequent, severe and
costly.[ ]
The macro-financial context is having an impact on both the financial and non-financial risks that banks
are facing.
Let me start by looking at the financial risks, focusing first of all on credit risk. Currently, the non-
performing loan (NPL) ratio stands close to historical lows at 2.3%. However, corporate insolvencies are
on the rise, potentially leading to higher credit risk. Moreover, downside risks may materialise in sectors
that are particularly sensitive to current macroeconomic trends.

In fact, we can see early signs of weakening asset quality, particularly in vulnerable sectors, such as
commercial real estate, and in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Worryingly, banks’ provisions
do not appear to sufficiently reflect downside risks, confirming some persistent shortcomings in their
International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9) provisioning frameworks.
Against this backdrop, European banking supervision made banks’ credit risk management one of its key
supervisory priorities for 2025-27, spurring on banks to pay close attention to the bread and butter task of
sound credit risk management.
For example, this means that instead of kicking the can down the road, banks should recognise
deteriorations in asset quality in a timely manner and ensure their provisioning develops in lockstep with
decreasing asset quality.
Banks are also advised to identify borrowers that may experience structural repayment difficulties in
sectors of the economy that are particularly sensitive to current macroeconomic trends. That is also why
we are continuing our supervisory work on vulnerable sectors, by focusing for instance on banks’
preparedness in dealing with potential economic deterioration across the full value chain of the automotive
sector.

Moving on to non-financial risks, let me stress that – especially in the current risk environment – strong
governance and sound risk culture are crucially important.[ ] Banks’ management bodies must ensure the
effective and prudent management of their bank[ ], and are therefore ultimately responsible for ensuring
that banks are prepared for the challenges of today’s risk landscape.
However, good governance, financial resilience and sound risk management are essential but not enough
in themselves to ensure that banks always remain at the service of the economy. To do so, they must also
be operationally resilient. Why is that?
Let’s take the example of Amsterdam Trade Bank (ATB), which filed for bankruptcy even though it had
ample capital and liquidity. What went wrong? Due to sanctions, ATB had lost access to its IT systems,
which were run by third-party providers. There were no adequate contingency arrangements in place, so
this well-capitalised, liquid, but operationally insufficiently resilient bank had to close.
Another example is last summer’s CrowdStrike incident, which caused the operating system of a major
provider to crash, displaying the so-called blue screen of death. This led to significant disruptions across
sectors, including banks.
Lastly, we can also see that the number of significant cyber incidents reported to the ECB more than
doubled between 2022 and 2024.

Worryingly, we see a clear increase in attacks on third-party providers to which banks have outsourced
certain services. Let me be clear: there are very good reasons for banks to outsource certain activities. For
example, if they want to take advantage of cost efficiencies, or be more agile and optimise their own
resources and expertise.[ ] However, as the rising number of cyber incidents highlights, outsourcing also
comes with risks that banks should assess thoroughly to ensure business continuity. Considering that
European banks are highly dependent on third-party providers, particular vigilance is needed, especially in
times of rapid geopolitical change. Banks may want to consider revisiting past risk management decisions
when (re-)assessing their outsourcing arrangements.
The examples that I just mentioned illustrate a fundamental point: in times of increasing digitalisation and
geopolitical tensions which are fuelling cyberattacks, operational resilience is more important than ever.
However, unlike financial resilience, operational resilience can’t be built up by accumulating Common
Equity Tier 1 (CET1). Instead, boosting operational resilience requires investment. Given the current rise

in banks’ profitability, the time is right to continue investing in operational resilience. The more banks invest
with strategic foresight, the better they will be operationally prepared if and when a cyberattack hits, for
example.
Moreover, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which became applicable in the EU earlier this
year, will help to further boost operational resilience as it provides a robust framework that requires banks
to foster a culture of continuous IT and cyber risk management.[ ]
What’s more, neither cyber risks nor other risks stop at borders. Given the interconnectedness of the
international financial system, international cooperation is vitally important. The good news is that we have
well-established existing global institutions and fora such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,
the Financial Stability Board and the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial
System, which remain essential for financial stability, especially in the current risk context.
Hence, as we navigate through a complex risk environment with heightened uncertainties, vigilance,
prudence and resilience are more important than ever. But resilience – whether financial or operational –
isn’t just about protecting banks from shocks. It’s also a foundation for long-term competitiveness. A bank
that is robust in times of crisis is also a bank that is robust at all times so that it can invest and compete to
the benefit households and firms.
Competitiveness and financial sector resilience are closely interlinked
And this brings us to a broader question in the debate on competitiveness: how does one ensure a strong
and competitive banking sector without compromising financial stability?
Let me be clear: framing financial stability and competitiveness as opposing forces is a fundamental
misconception. Evidence shows that stronger, better capitalised banks are more competitive and – most
importantly – better equipped to lend to the real economy.[ ] Impact assessments of the post-crisis
reforms in the banking sector show that the benefits clearly outweigh any potential unintended side
effects.[ ] Hence, competitiveness and financial sector resilience are closely interlinked. Neither can exist
without the other.
Having said that, we generally support simplifying the regulatory framework where possible, as long as the
current level of resilience of the banking sector is maintained and any changes are based on prior, sound
impact assessments and cost-benefit analyses. After all, if we all agree that it only makes sense to
legislate after solid ex ante impact assessments and sound analyses show that the benefits of certain
rules outweigh their costs, then it must make just as much sense to rigorously perform these same
assessments and analyses before scrapping those very same rules.
We must ensure that any short-term gains in simplification do not actually result in any long-term loss of
resilience prudently built up over the last decade. We also need to ensure that simplification efforts do not
leave pockets of risk unaddressed.
11

Let me illustrate this with an example. As prudential supervisors, our true north is that no material risk
remains unaddressed. An important precondition for banks to be able to prudently manage their risks is
that they have accurate risk data and information from their customers. The financial risks stemming from
the ongoing climate and nature crises are no exception to that principle. It is therefore vitally important that
any attempts to simplify sustainability reporting for companies do not result in critically important data
points needed by banks to adequately manage their climate and nature-related risks no longer being
disclosed in a harmonised manner. If this were to happen, banks would either no longer be able to conduct
adequate risk management, or they would have to resort to requiring additional data from their clients on
top of the current regulatory regime, which would be burdensome both for banks and their clients.
The economist Hyman Minsky wisely stated that, as memories of past crises fade, attitudes towards
regulation change. Let me add that if such attitudes lead to confusing simplification and deregulation,
memories of past crises could return with a vengeance.
The last thing we should do, especially as we go through times of high uncertainty, is to let our guard down
as regards resilience and hamper banks’ ability to manage their risks, thinking that “this time will be
different’’, the phrase so poignantly coined in Rogoff’s and Reinhard’s “Eight Centuries of Financial Folly”.
[ ] Let us, for once, avoid such folly and sidestep that all-too-attractive trap.
Instead, let me point to an often overlooked yet crucially important aspect that has significant simplification
potential and does not come at the expense of resilience: a primary root cause of complexity in the
European framework lies in the persistent fragmentation of rules at national level. For example, many
facets of the current prudential framework do not actually consist of a single European regulation but of a
patchwork of nationally transposed directives. To truly reduce complexity, we need more harmonisation at
EU level through directly applicable regulations which would achieve a truly unified single rulebook. I
would even go as far as to say that a more integrated and European approach is the most effective way
forward to ensure that our regulatory framework is simpler and more effective. Financial markets would
also greatly benefit from the harmonisation of corporate insolvency rules, accounting frameworks and
securities laws, as well as from better disclosure of financial information by EU corporates. To make
progress in these areas, alternatives methods could be envisaged, such as the introduction of a 28th
regime, which would be a practical and very welcome intermediate step towards further harmonisation
within the EU.
A completed banking union, including the establishment of a European deposit insurance scheme and a
fully integrated capital markets union, would help eliminate barriers that still hinder market integration and
would ensure that the financial system fosters both stability and growth. The path to greater
competitiveness does not therefore lie in deregulation but in further European integration.
Moreover, as far as European banking supervision is concerned, we continuously apply a risk-based
approach to simplify and reduce complexity and cost factors that unduly inhibit our task of keeping banks
sound.
14

One example of our drive for “simplification without compromising resilience” is the comprehensive reform
of our annual health check of banks, the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process, which we recently
made leaner, more risk based and more efficient.
The recent, fast-track approval process for standardised securitisations is another excellent example of
how, in close dialogue with the industry, processes can be simplified within the existing regulatory
framework. By leveraging product standardisation for sufficiently simple significant risk transfer
transactions, the fast-track process will lead to efficiency gains without – crucially – weakening our focus
on relevant risks. I sincerely hope that together we can identify and pursue more initiatives of this kind.
We will also continue to reduce processing times by making better use of supervisory technology tools that
use cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence. For example, since March 2023 we have
been machine reading and pre-screening all our fit and proper applications, which speeds up supervisory
assessments and, in turn, the responsiveness to banks.[ ]
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The progress made over the past decade has made European banks more resilient. Banks have evolved
from shock propagators to shock absorbers.
As we navigate through the storms brewing over today’s increasingly complex risk landscape, stable
banks are more important than ever.
Rolling back on safety and soundness would not only undermine financial stability but also weaken banks’
ability to finance the real economy.
Does that mean that there is no room for regulatory simplification? Does it mean that there is no room for
any efficiency gains in the way we supervise? Of course not.
But let us stay on course while we explore how to simplify and harmonise the regulatory framework.
Let us stay on course while we continue to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our supervision.
And let us stay on course in ensuring that the European banking system remains resilient.
Because resilient banks are nothing less than the bedrock of competitiveness and growth.
Thank you for your attention.

The ECB uses a dedicated tool called Heimdall, which is constantly updated and enhancements. For
instance, we have further automatised the transfer of findings from fit and proper assessment to our core
IT systems and in turn their timely communication to banks. Heimdall also supports a risk-based
supervision approach as supervisors can now more easily focus on cases flagged as complex and at the
same time speed up the assessment and conclusion of simpler cases. See ECB (2025), “
