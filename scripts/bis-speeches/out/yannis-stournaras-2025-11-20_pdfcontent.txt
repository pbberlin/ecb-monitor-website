Yannis Stournaras: Lessons from the Greek sovereign debt crisis
Speech by Mr Yannis Stournaras, Governor of the Bank of Greece, in the context of his 
honorary recognition from the "Istituto Bruno Leoni" titled "Lessons from the Greek 
sovereign debt crisis", Athens, 7 November 2025.
* * *
Ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great honour to receive recognition from the Istituto Bruno Leoni for the efforts 
undertaken by my country, Greece, to overcome the debt crisis. In two public roles, as 
Finance Minister from mid-2012 to mid-2014 and Central Bank Governor since then, I 
have sought to actively support this national effort, deeply rooted in the determination 
and aspirations of the Greek people, while at the same time safeguarding the 
independence of the Bank of Greece and Greece's participation in the eurozone. In my 
remarks today, I will offer a concise overview of how Greece entered the debt crisis, 
how it got out despite the gloomy forecasts of many market analysts, policymakers and 
academics who predicted Grexit twice, in 2012 and 2015, and the key lessons to be 
drawn from that experience. I will then outline the substantial progress achieved in 
recent years and the outlook for the Greek economy, before concluding with the lasting 
legacy of the crisis and the challenges that still lie ahead – both for Greece and for the 
eurozone more broadly.
1. What led to the Greek crisis
Following a strong and sustained nominal convergence effort in the 1990s, during which 
nominal interest rates fell by more than 15 percentage points, Greece experienced 
strong economic growth, low inflation and falling unemployment from 2000 to 2007, 
largely driven by rapid credit expansion and cheap borrowing, particularly after entry 
into the eurozone in 2001. However, structural weaknesses remained. The Maastricht 
criteria for participation in the eurozone focused mainly on nominal convergence – 
inflation, deficit, a falling debt ratio, interest rates and the exchange rate – but did not 
require deep and sustainable reforms in labour markets, product markets, the pension 
system and public administration to improve structural competitiveness and institutional 
capacity. As a result, while GDP per capita rose rapidly and approached the EU 
average, governance, productivity, pension system sustainability and structural 
competitiveness lagged behind, while the fiscal deficit remained almost twice as large 
as the reference value.
In fact, towards the end of the 2000s fiscal policy became overly expansionary, driven 
by the political cycle, while real wage growth exceeded productivity growth by a wide 
margin. The ensuing real exchange rate appreciation along with rapid economic growth 
led to a large current account deficit. The general government deficit in 2008 and 2009 
jumped to 10% and 15% of GDP respectively, from 6% on average in the period 2000-
2007. The public debt ratio rose to 128% of GDP in 2009 from 104% in 2007.  
Hence, the Greek crisis did not start as a banking crisis as in other Member States, but 
as a fiscal crisis, which led to a current account crisis, a sovereign debt crisis and, 

2/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
eventually, a banking crisis through government bond losses, withdrawal of deposits 
and an explosion of non-performing loans (NPLs).
Crucially, Greece failed to use the favourable pre-crisis period to address persistent 
vulnerabilities. Public administration continued to be inefficient, tax evasion was 
widespread, the pension system remained unsustainable and the public debt ratio 
stayed constant but high, around 105% of GDP, before it soared in 2008 and 2009 to 
unsustainable levels.
When the sovereign debt crisis hit in 2010, Greece rapidly lost market access. Credit 
ratings were downgraded, bond yields surged and both the government and the 
banking sector were cut off from international funding. Depositors withdrew cash, real 
estate collateral values slumped and liquidity conditions deteriorated sharply.
Greece attempted to address the large fiscal and external imbalances in its first 
economic adjustment programme through rapid fiscal consolidation and reforms to 
achieve the necessary improvement in competitiveness in the absence of an exchange 
rate devaluation. Fiscal consolidation relied more on tax increases rather than spending 
cuts and pro-growth reforms. With the benefit of hindsight, reforms were rather poorly 
sequenced under the insistence of the "three institutions" (IMF, European Commission, 
ECB), targeting labour markets first and then product markets. As a result, nominal 
wages declined faster than prices, leading to falling real wages and collapsing 
household consumption, further exacerbating the recession. Banking sector fragility 
was aggravated by soaring NPLs; EU-level weaknesses further worsened the crisis as 
early EMU architecture lacked tools for crisis management; debt relief was delayed; and 
the sovereign-bank doom loop amplified instability – until decisive ECB intervention in 
mid-2012 finally stabilised conditions.
2. What was the effect of the economic adjustment programmes
In response to the sovereign debt crisis, Greece implemented three consecutive 
economic adjustment programmes from 2010 onwards, supported by the "three 
institutions" and its European partners. These programmes aimed at fiscal 
consolidation, structural reforms and banking system stabilisation to restore 
macroeconomic balance and regain market confidence.
The programmes achieved their major stabilisation goals: the primary fiscal deficit of 
10.1% of GDP in 2009 turned into a primary surplus exceeding 4% of GDP by 2018, 
while the current account deficit fell by roughly 12 percentage points between 2009 and 
2018. Comprehensive structural reforms were implemented in pensions, healthcare, 
labour markets, tax administration and public administration, improving long-term 
competitiveness and fiscal sustainability. At the same time, Greece began rebalancing 
its growth model toward exports and tradable activities.
The banking sector underwent deep restructuring. Extensive mergers and liquidations 
reduced the system to four systemic banks, now controlling over 95% of the market. 
The Bank of Greece played a pivotal role by ensuring monetary and financial stability, 
maintaining liquidity, securing uninterrupted cash availability nationwide and 
coordinating closely with the ECB and European supervisory authorities. Thanks to 
mechanisms such as the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) and the Hellenic 

3/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Asset Protection Scheme (HAPS "Hercules"), the NPL ratio was slashed from 49% in 
2016 to 3.6% by mid-2025, while capital ratios, profitability and regulatory resilience all 
improved significantly. Capital controls were imposed in 2015-2019 to safeguard 
financial stability. In fact, not a single euro of deposits was lost, thus fully protecting 
financial stability, even during the difficult period when the majority of analysts, 
academics and certain policymakers predicted, or even recommended, Grexit.
However, the adjustment came at a substantial social and economic cost. The process 
relied more on tax increases rather than expenditure reforms or investment-friendly 
policies, and privatisation targets were largely unmet. The "three institutions" insisted on 
excessive and rapid fiscal adjustment and ignored its impact on growth, employment, 
social cohesion, tax revenue and the "snowball effect" (that is, the difference between 
the effective nominal interest rate on public debt and the nominal growth rate, a 
significant determinant of debt ratio dynamics). Between 2008 and 2016, Greece lost 
over one-quarter of its GDP, the unemployment rate surged by 16 percentage points, 
inequality and poverty indices soared, investment collapsed, and a massive brain drain 
occurred. Thus, while macroeconomic stabilisation and banking repair were ultimately 
successful, the cost in terms of lost output, social cohesion and long-term human and 
physical capital was immense.
3. Lessons learned from the Greek crisis
The Greek crisis offers several key lessons for economic policy, monetary union 
governance and crisis management.
First, political ownership and credibility matter. Populism, political polarisation and 
vested interests can hold back reforms and undermine economic recovery. Strong 
political leadership, institutional commitment and transparent policy frameworks 
enhance confidence among investors, households and international partners.
Second, fiscal and external imbalances must be addressed before they reach 
unsustainable levels. Reliance only on nominal convergence criteria, without structural 
reforms, can mask vulnerabilities and delay necessary adjustments. Countries joining a 
monetary union need to strengthen institutions, governance and structural 
competitiveness in parallel with fiscal convergence. Labour cost competitiveness is a 
necessary but not sufficient condition for structural competitiveness.
Third, the sequencing and design of structural reforms are crucial. Reforms that 
excessively depress wages or focus narrowly on one sector can exacerbate recessions. 
A balanced approach that combines fiscal consolidation with growth-enhancing 
structural measures and public investment is essential. Legislative and administrative 
capacity must be adequate to implement reforms efficiently and effectively.
Fourth, the banking sector requires careful oversight and timely interventions during 
crises. The failure to early manage NPLs prolonged the recession and weakened 
banks' capacity to finance the real economy. A systemic solution for distressed assets 
at the earliest possible stage, supported by an appropriate legal and institutional 
framework, is critical.

Fifth, the architecture of a monetary union matters for crisis resolution. The absence of 
effective risk-sharing mechanisms, crisis management tools and coordinated oversight 
within EMU amplified Greece's difficulties. Timely ECB intervention, the creation of the 
ESM, public debt restructuring and favourable refinancing conditions were essential to 
prevent a disorderly default and stabilise the system. Notably, Greece ultimately 
benefited from generous debt refinancing on very favourable terms, which created a 
favourable "snowball effect" by allowing the debt-to-GDP ratio to improve as the 
effective interest rate on public debt remained below GDP growth for extended periods. 
In addition, the ECB waiver ensured the smooth refinancing of the Greek banking 
system during the crisis years – a support that was no longer necessary once Greece 
regained investment-grade status.
Finally, crisis management requires both fiscal discipline and support for long-term 
growth. Greece's experience demonstrates that adjustment programmes can restore 
macroeconomic balance and improve competitiveness, but at a high social cost. Future 
policy programmes should balance fiscal targets with structural reforms and growth-
oriented policies to minimise social hardship and shorten recovery periods. Public 
investment should be exempted from expenditure cuts, while the effects on the public 
debt ratio from the improvement in the primary balance of general government induced 
by fiscal measures should be considered along with the "snowball effect".
In sum, Greece's crisis underscores the need for robust institutions, both at home and 
in the EU, effective governance, prudent fiscal policies and comprehensive structural 
reforms. The combination of domestic weaknesses, institutional gaps, delayed reforms 
and external shocks created one of the most severe economic crises in history. Yet, the 
response through the adjustment programmes has restored macroeconomic and 
financial stability, fiscal sustainability and competitiveness, offering valuable lessons for 
both Greece and other member countries of monetary unions. In addition, Greece can 
be seen as the midwife of history: due to the Greek crisis, the eurozone and Europe 
created new institutions and obtained experience and the necessary mentality and 
attitude for crisis management, which proved useful later during the Covid-19 
pandemic. Hopefully, it will continue to prove useful in the years ahead.
4. Progress, current state and outlook of the Greek economy, and 
policy priorities ahead
Greece has undergone a profound economic transformation in recent years, emerging 
as one of the euro area's strongest performers after over a decade of crisis and 
structural adjustment. Since 2019, Greek GDP growth has consistently outpaced the 
euro area average, bringing the country back to a path of convergence towards 
European income levels following many years of divergence. In the first half of 2025, 
real GDP grew by approximately 2% year-on-year – significantly above the euro area 
average – and the Bank of Greece expects comparable growth rates to be sustained 
through at least 2027.
Most importantly, this trajectory is not underpinned by short-term stimulus, but rather by 
strong fundamentals: solid public finances; resilient household consumption; a powerful 
rebound in investment supported by the RRF (Recovery and Resilience Facility); and 
exceptional export performance – particularly in tourism, logistics, digital services and

innovation-intensive sectors. Meanwhile, the labour market has strengthened, with 
unemployment falling to single-digit levels for the first time since the beginning of the 
crisis and labour force participation rising, while export reach is extending beyond 
tourism towards high-value-added manufacturing goods. Rising disposable incomes 
and a marked decline in inequality, poverty and social exclusion indices between 2019 
and 2023 demonstrate that the recovery is now translating into social welfare gains as 
well, rather than just macroeconomic ones.
Macroeconomic governance has been instrumental in rebuilding international 
confidence. Greece continues to deliver robust primary and overall budget surpluses 
without reverting to restrictive fiscal policy measures, but instead supported by 
disciplined public finances, improved tax administration and a forceful crackdown on tax 
evasion. Public debt is firmly declining as a percentage of GDP, driven by strong 
nominal GDP growth and favourable debt service conditions. Sound fiscal policies have 
created space for targeted tax relief, protection of vulnerable households and 
investment in digital, green and infrastructure priorities – all while remaining fully 
aligned with the EU fiscal rules. International rating agencies have responded with 
sovereign and banking upgrades, helping to attract renewed foreign capital into Greek 
assets.
However, the external environment remains fragile. Geopolitical instability, protectionist 
pressures, financial fragmentation, major climate disruption, and energy volatility are 
sources of considerable downside risks. At home, certain legacy issues from the crisis, 
such as private debt, lower capital stock and labour force, a persistent investment gap, 
as well as demographic pressures, low female and youth labour force participation, and 
delays in judicial and administrative reforms, remain unresolved, while housing costs 
continue to impose a growing burden on households.
Against this background, Greece has shifted its focus from recovery to "strategic 
acceleration". Its central economic objective is now to secure long-term real 
convergence with the euro area without recreating past macroeconomic imbalances. 
Achieving this requires closing the remaining investment gap and sustaining 
productivity gains by efficiently mobilising and allocating domestic resources, EU 
structural and RRF funds as well as foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in 
sectors producing internationally traded goods and services, in a world increasingly 
shaped by technological progress and geopolitical competition.
Macroeconomic, fiscal and financial stability must remain the linchpin. Strict adherence 
to EU rules and accelerated debt reduction, including early repayment of the Greek 
Loan Facility (GLF), will be essential to preserve credibility. But stability is not enough. 
Fiscal strategy needs to become intrinsically pro-growth, redirecting spending towards 
infrastructure, education, innovation and demographic support, while modernising the 
tax system to reinforce competitiveness and fairness.
The decisive battleground is investment mobilisation. RRF deployment must be fast and 
effective, but external funding alone is insufficient. Private capital must be aggressively 
attracted through faster licensing, capital market deepening and non-bank finance 
development – while private savings should be rebuilt through the enhancement of the 
third, fully funded, pillar of the pension system, the provision of incentives for closing the 
insurance gap for natural catastrophes and improvements in financial literacy.

Finally, Greece must view the green and digital transitions not as obligations but as 
strategic competitiveness opportunities. Accelerated investment in renewables, grid 
capacity, interconnections, AI readiness and circular economy innovation is essential – 
as is a housing policy shift from subsidies to structural supply-side reform.
If policy consistency, institutional credibility and reform momentum are maintained, 
Greece is positioned not merely to sustain recovery but to graduate into a phase of 
permanently higher investment ratio, productivity growth and economic resilience.
5. Concluding remarks: The EU/EMU lessons from the Greek crisis
The Greek crisis showcased the vital need for fiscal discipline and debt sustainability in 
the euro area. It also highlighted that structural rigidities must be addressed to boost 
productivity and investment. Greece's experience underscores the importance of 
innovation, high-tech transition, efficient use of EU funds and FDI, deeper capital 
markets and secure, affordable energy to enhance long-term competitiveness and 
resilience.
However, while Greece and other Member States must remain fully committed to 
structural reforms, a purely national strategy is no longer sufficient. The global 
environment has shifted dramatically in just a few years, with rising geopolitical 
fragmentation, armed conflicts, trade tensions, tariffs and intensifying technological 
rivalry among major powers. Europe as a whole now confronts a broad set of 
challenges, not only economic but also technological, environmental, energy- and 
security-related. It is increasingly clear that a coherent European-wide strategy is 
required, in line with the strategic thinking reflected in recent high-level reports such as 
the Letta report on deepening the Single Market and eliminating the still large internal 
barriers to trade in goods and services, as well as the Draghi report on Europe's 
investment needs, productivity and competitiveness. Only through coordinated joint 
action can the EU hope to close productivity and innovation gaps, reinforce resilience 
and preserve its strategic autonomy.
In this regard, recent EU initiatives such as the ReArm Europe Plan and Readiness 
2030, as well as the European Commission's Competitiveness Compass and Clean 
Industry Pact, signal a major policy shift towards a stronger, forward-looking industrial 
and strategic posture, which seek to incentivise investment in new technologies and 
innovation. These initiatives support deeper market integration and stimulate large-
scale investment in critical technologies and infrastructure, thereby increasing resilience 
to external shocks. Completing the banking union – especially through the 
establishment of a European deposit insurance scheme – and launching a true savings 
and investment union would significantly reduce financial fragmentation. Building on the 
success of NextGenerationEU, the issuance of a permanent common EU safe asset 
such as a Eurobond, could catalyse cross-border investment, strengthen the 
international role of the euro and decisively enhance Europe's long-term 
competitiveness.
