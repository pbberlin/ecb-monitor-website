Luis de Guindos: Financial stability in the euro area
Speech by Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the 
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Annual General Meeting, 
Amsterdam, 15 May 2025.

Introduction
Recent months have been rather eventful on global financial markets, bringing to the 
fore discussions about risks to financial stability and the resilience of financial 
institutions. I would like to explore these topics in more detail today, with a particular 
focus on the euro area.
A volatile and uncertain macro-financial outlook
Faced with the reality that globalisation as we know it has come to an end, the world is 
adjusting to a new environment. As our economic and financial systems adapt, greater 
geoeconomic fragmentation globally may increase the likelihood of more frequent and 
more impactful adverse tail events. The most immediate concern is that ongoing trade 
tensions could escalate into a trade war, with potentially significant negative 
consequences for global growth, inflation and asset prices.
As the euro area economy is very open and deeply integrated into global supply chains, 
there are a number of financial stability vulnerabilities that could be tested. But the 
elevated level of uncertainty has not been limited to trade. Several other policy areas, 
including monetary, fiscal and national security policies, have also been affected.
Key financial stability vulnerabilities
We see three key vulnerabilities in the ECB Financial Stability Review to be published 
next week. The first concerns financial markets. A considerable increase in US trade 
policy uncertainty to more than 60 times the historical average has injected significant 
volatility into financial markets. Trade policy uncertainty can also lead to greater 
exchange rate volatility, affecting portfolio investment decisions and capital flows. 
Equity markets remain particularly vulnerable to sudden, sharp adjustments owing to 
persistently high valuations and risk concentration. We have warned of vulnerabilities 
posed by high valuations that are not backed by fundamentals, and recent financial 
market volatility has shone a light on this source of risk. Notably, the CBOE Volatility 
Index (VIX), jumped to three times its historical average following the announcement of 
US import tariffs on 2 April. As the considerable declines in the aftermath of that 
announcement have largely been recouped, equity valuations – especially in the United 
States – remain elevated.
We also continue to see strong geographical and sectoral market concentrations. While 
the United States accounts for around 4% of the world's population and around a 
quarter of global GDP, its equity market accounts for more than two-thirds of global 
equity market capitalisation according to the MSCI global index. Moreover, just a

handful of large US-based technology companies account for 30% of S&P 500 market 
capitalisation. Like with equity market risk premia, credit spreads remain compressed 
and appear to be out of sync with the very high levels of geopolitical and policy 
uncertainty. As such, there is a risk that investors may be underestimating and 
underpricing the likelihood and impact of adverse scenarios. Negative surprises in a 
volatile and uncertain environment – including sharply deteriorating economic growth 
prospects, sudden changes in monetary policy expectations or an escalation of trade 
tensions – could lead to further abrupt shifts in investor sentiment, causing spillovers 
across different asset classes while fuelling investors' interest in alternatives such as 
gold and crypto-assets, as we have recently seen.
The second vulnerability relates to the euro area economy. Escalating trade tensions 
could affect euro area firms and households, with potential credit risks for both banks 
and non-banks. On aggregate, the balance sheet fundamentals of euro area firms and 
households have improved in recent years, with their levels of indebtedness falling 
below those seen before the pandemic. However, trade tensions, high funding costs 
and weak growth could be a sign of headwinds in the near future. And even if trade 
tensions subside, this period of high uncertainty is very likely to have led to 
precautionary actions by firms and households, which could act as a drag on growth. In 
addition to increased foreign competition, rising global trade tensions could exacerbate 
credit risk in the corporate sector, with a negative impact on the profitability of firms 
operating in highly export-oriented and tariff-sensitive sectors, such as the steel industry 
or the automotive sector. Households continue to benefit from stable labour markets, 
rising real wages and higher savings. But this situation could reverse if trade-related 
corporate vulnerabilities unravel and lay-offs in the corporate sector rise, which could 
have an adverse impact on employment and consumption.
The third vulnerability is related to sovereign risks. The public debt-to-GDP ratio in the 
euro area has fallen since the pandemic but the fiscal positions of some euro area 
countries remain weak. And looking ahead, although higher defence spending and 
substantial infrastructure investments are warranted in light of current geoeconomic 
challenges, they are likely to lead to a deterioration in fiscal balances.
These expectations have led markets to price in higher government financing needs 
which, together with the expectation that additional spending could have a positive 
impact on growth, contributed to the recent rise in ten-year euro area government bond 
yields. This rise has since partly reversed as a result of "flight to safety" inflows to euro 
area government bond markets following the announcements of US tariffs. 
Nevertheless, an increase in debt servicing costs could put a further strain on fiscal 
positions, especially in countries which have high short-term refinancing needs and are 
already burdened by high debt levels. Moreover, the risks to growth resulting from trade 
tensions combined with higher defence spending may limit the fiscal space available to 
shield the economy from adverse shocks, address structural challenges associated with 
climate change, digitalisation and low productivity, and manage the economic 
implications of ageing populations.
Financial sector resilience
Given these vulnerabilities, we have to ask ourselves whether euro area financial 
institutions are sufficiently well prepared to cope with the associated risks.

3/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Euro area banks are well capitalised, supported by solid profitability and robust asset 
quality. However, while non-performing loan ratios remain near historical lows, the 
credit risk outlook for corporate and household portfolios is expected to deteriorate 
given weak macro-financial conditions, the lagged impact of high interest rates on 
borrowers and escalating trade tensions. In particular, any broader and longer-lasting 
macro-financial effects of trade policy uncertainty could lead to a deterioration in banks' 
asset quality, especially for banks with higher exposures to sectors that rely on trade 
with countries outside the EU.
At the same time, lower net interest income poses downside risks to bank profitability, 
especially for banks with a higher share of floating rate loans and a higher cost of risk. 
The extremely uncertain external environment reinforces the need to keep 
macroprudential capital buffer requirements at levels that ensure the banking sector 
remains resilient. The regulatory and supervisory framework has effectively 
safeguarded financial stability while also supporting economic growth. Nevertheless, 
there is scope to make the framework more efficient and effective by reducing 
unwarranted complexities without compromising banks' resilience.
On a positive note, the recent high volatility has not impeded the functioning of financial 
markets. Overall, non-banks appear to have weathered the adverse market 
disturbances relatively well thus far. They have also continued to absorb a high share of 
sovereign debt, underscoring their important role in euro area sovereign bond markets 
in the context of higher debt issuance.
However, sharp adjustments could still become disorderly, especially if non-banks' low 
levels of liquidity amplify price swings. In an environment of heightened geopolitical and 
trade policy uncertainty, non-banks may face higher valuation losses and more frequent 
margin calls as trade tensions increase market volatility and weigh on asset quality. 
Significant exposures to US dollar-denominated assets may also increase the risk of 
additional spillovers from potential US market shocks and exchange rate fluctuations. In 
particular, structural liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds, exacerbated by 
escalating global trade disputes that heighten the risk of sudden outflows, could leave 
liquid asset holdings insufficient to cover severe yet plausible redemption shocks, 
thereby amplifying adverse market dynamics. Insurance corporations and pension 
funds could also face liquidity pressures as a result of increasing margin calls, as these 
entities make extensive use of interest rate derivatives for hedging purposes. At the 
same time, increasing synthetic leverage in some entities, like hedge funds, may 
exacerbate risks of financial contagion and expose liquidity vulnerabilities through 
margin calls.
These persistent liquidity and leverage vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial 
intermediation (NBFI) sector require a comprehensive policy response. The rising 
market footprint and interconnectedness of non-banks increases the risk that NBFI 
vulnerabilities amplify adverse market developments across the entire financial system. 
This is why we need an effective macroprudential policy framework for non-banks that 
improves the sector's resilience. The policy response should focus on addressing key 
structural vulnerabilities in the NBFI sector, including monitoring and tackling risks from 
non-bank leverage, enhancing the liquidity preparedness of non-banks to meet margin 
and collateral calls, and mitigating liquidity mismatches in the investment fund sector. 
Moreover, strengthening NBFI policies would help ensure that non-banks remain

resilient under stress and thus bolster the capital markets union. It is vital that we 
establish comprehensive and resilient capital markets to reinforce the EU's Single 
Market, in addition to fostering economic and financial integration and ensuring that 
innovative companies have access to sufficient sources of financing. This cannot be 
achieved in isolation – it requires enhanced EU-wide supervisory coordination and 
improved global cooperation to level the playing field and minimise the potential for 
regulatory arbitrage.
Conclusion
All in all, financial stability in the euro area has remained sound throughout the market 
turbulence and major uncertainty. But despite broad resilience in both the financial and 
non-financial sectors, there is no room for complacency. Uncertainties arising from 
trade tensions, deregulation and reduced international cooperation are fuelling 
concerns about global economic and regulatory fragmentation. Rising trade tensions 
pose particular risks to the open euro area economy that is deeply integrated into global 
supply chains. In this highly uncertain and volatile environment, the likelihood of tail 
events remains high. Risk sentiment could deteriorate abruptly as still high valuations 
and increasing risk concentration render equity and credit markets vulnerable to 
shocks. While increased defence spending has the potential to boost growth if it is well 
targeted and sourced from within the EU, it may exacerbate fiscal vulnerabilities in 
some countries. And trade policy uncertainty could have an adverse impact on trade-
reliant firms, with the associated broader economic repercussions translating into rising 
credit risk for banks and non-banks. Given this elevated and pervasive uncertainty, 
strong regulatory and supervisory frameworks remain key across all financial sectors to 
ensure that the resilience we have seen up to now also holds firm in the face of future 
risks.
