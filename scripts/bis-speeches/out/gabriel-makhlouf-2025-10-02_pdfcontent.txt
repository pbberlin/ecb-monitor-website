Speech by GovernorGabriel Makhlouf to OECD
 
Growing pains: how
demographics, migration
and technology will reshape
Europe’s workforce
Lecture at the OECD
Good morning and thank you for the invitation to speak here today.  It is a pleasure to
be back at the OECD and to talk about a topic that is rarely far from the top of the policy
agenda, namely labour market developments. Whether it is in relation to long-run
growth prospects or the drivers of inflation, labour market dynamics play a crucial role. 
My speech will today will cover three inter-related topics.
First, I will reflect on the resilience of labour markets over the last five years,
highlighting the key developments that have seen employment in the euro area grow
steadily, despite a sequence of negative shocks.

Next, I will explore how looming demographic challenges, ageing populations, declining
fertility and shrinking work forces, will drag on employment growth and therefore
economic growth in the coming decades, with migration only offering a partial, albeit
important, solution to the challenge.
As demographic headwinds bite, finding ways to boost labour force participation and
productivity becomes even more important as a driver of economic growth. Despite this,
policy reforms to structurally raise participation rates in Europe have been slow in
coming. On top of this, recent productivity trends for the euro area are not good.  In the
final part of my speech I will discuss how new technologies, and artificial intelligence
(AI) specifically, can be harnessed to boost productivity, and how this interacts with
some of the labour market dynamics.
The Euro Area Labour Market
2019-2025: a quiet champion
In the face of unprecedented shocks in recent years, the Euro area labour market has
held up exceptionally well. This performance is all the more remarkable when we recall
the hysteresis that characterised previous downturns. And it’s why I refer to it as the
‘quiet champion’.
The labour market entered the pandemic in good shape. Monthly unemployment in the
euro area reached a low of 7.2 percent in March 2020, reflecting steady, if
unspectacular, growth since around 2015. Notably, around two-thirds of the expansion
of the labour force in the years prior to the pandemic was immigration from outside of
the euro area. Around this time, falling unemployment and rising job vacancies were
also contributing to tighter labour market conditions, seen as a key driver of wage
growth.2

The pandemic triggered an immediate labour market disruption. Labour demand ground
to a halt as job openings collapsed (PDF 946.55KB). Unemployment peaked at 8.6 per
cent in August 2020. However, the euro area’s response differed markedly from other
regions, particularly the United States which saw a much larger unemployment spike.
The difference reflected the extensive use of job retention schemes across Euro area
countries, which maintained employment relationships while reducing working hours.
These policies helped to support incomes in the face of an exceptional shock, but also
facilitated a smoother recovery once economic activity resumed.
By the third quarter of 2021, little more than 18 months after the start of the pandemic,
the employment rate in the euro area was above pre-pandemic levels, at 69 per cent of
the working age population. Post-pandemic labour market dynamics have, however,
proved to be more than just a rebound. Employment has continued to grow despite
further shocks such as the war in Ukraine and rising geopolitical tensions, with the euro
area employment rate hitting 70.8 per cent in late 2024; unemployment hit an all-time
low of 6.2 per cent in late 2024 and has remained around that level since.
Several factors contributed to this resurgence.
On the demand side, post-pandemic pent-up demand, especially in consumer facing
services, boosted the demand for workers. The slow adjustment of real wages – falling
by around 2 per cent between 2021 and 2023 – was another important factor. As wage
adjustment to the inflation surge lagged, this acted as a ‘shock absorber’, making
labour more attractive than capital and thereby supporting labour demand.   
 points to the combined role of high profit margins and falling real wages in
providing financial space for firms to hoard labour during the recovery from the crisis,
especially in manufacturing.

On the supply side, the labour force in the euro area increased by over 8 million
between 2021 and 2025, growing at an average annual rate of 1.2 per cent.   This is
almost four times the rate of growth we saw prior to the pandemic. And, much like the
earlier period, migration has been an important source of workforce growth. Eurostat
data shows that almost half of the increase in the size of the labour force is from foreign
workers, that is, non-euro area nationals. In addition, foreign workers have also seen a
larger increase in their employment rate in recent years, relative to nationals. The
combined effects on GDP are large:  has estimated that 4 of the 5 percentage
point cumulative increase in GDP between 2019 and 2024 is attributable to foreign
workers.  
This is a euro area picture. When we look at individual countries, the relative role
played by migration and increasing employment and participation rates differs. For
example, growth in Italy, with a relatively lower participation rate, has been helped more
by higher participation rates of nationals. Whereas the likes of Germany, with a
declining working age population, has relied more on an influx of foreign workers to
offset the effects of the population ageing. Some countries, like Ireland and Spain have
relied on both channels, with higher participation rates and inward migration boosting
employment growth in both countries.   
I emphasise the migration channel for two reasons. First, assumptions about migration
patterns can have a big impact on population growth estimates, as I outline below.
Second, in the euro area, migration happens : there was an
almost identical increase in the share of high-skilled migrant and national employment
between 2015 and 2023. This suggests that migration also matters for productivity
growth.  I return to this in the next section that looks at longer-term demographic
trends.
Longer-term demographic trends –
where cyclical meets the structural
Looking ahead, at a euro area level some labour market cooling is expected over the
current forecast horizon, through to end-2027. The September ECB staff
macroeconomic projections have annual employment growth averaging around 0.5 per
cent over the next two years, a significant drop-off compared to the recent experience.

Some of this reflects a cooling of labour demand. We are already seeing this in job
vacancies, which have declined from their post-pandemic peaks, although at the
country level we see  in these trends. For example, job
postings in Spain and Italy remain around 50 per cent above pre-pandemic levels;
whereas in Germany and France, the figure is closer to 15-20 per cent, reflecting more
labour market cooling in these countries.
The employment growth slowdown also reflects demographic factors that were initially
rather slow moving, but are now beginning to bite. I have previously talked about this as
the ‘quick-quick’ phase of demographic change: a period when the population structure
in many countries will go through a rapid transition phase, culminating in a far larger
retired and elderly population, essentially an inversion of the population pyramid (PDF
1.35MB) that has characterised many developed countries for decades. Between 2024
and 2027, the euro area working age population is  (or
1.5 million workers between the ages of 15 and 64).  Some countries see large
declines, for example Latvia (-4.8 per cent), Lithuania (-3.4 per cent), Greece (-2.6 per
cent), Portugal (-2.1 per cent), Germany (-1.5 per cent) and Austria (-1.3 per cent).
Even among those countries treading water – such as Belgium, France, Spain, the
Netherlands, Finland and Cyprus, all start to see their working age populations decline
from 2027 onwards. The longer-term impact is stark: the ‘old-age dependency ratio’ in
the euro area, that is, the population aged 65 and over as a proportion of the population
aged 15-64, is set to increase sharply from 33.7 in 2022 to 51.2 in 2050.  
cross-country differences
projected to fall by 0.7 per cent

These trends will exert varying, and sometimes contradictory, effects on inflation. An
older population with lower consumption and higher savings could place downward
pressure on aggregate demand, limiting price growth in certain sectors. This aligns with
the “secular stagnation” hypothesis, which has argued that ageing societies are more
prone to disinflationary forces. At the same time, a shrinking working-age population will
tighten labour markets in the absence of increases in labour force participation rates.
This puts upward pressure on wages that feed into services inflation. Moreover, as
older cohorts consume more health care and age-related services; relative price
increases in those areas may become more entrenched. The balance of these effects is
hard to predict, but one potential outcome is higher structural inflation in labour-
intensive, non-tradable sectors (i.e. services), even as weak aggregate demand keeps
headline inflation subdued. This creates an environment in which inflation dynamics are
increasingly segmented, complicating the job of central banks that aim to stabilise
prices economy-wide.
Returning to demographic trends, the workforce in Ireland is also ageing, although the
trend somewhat lags what we see in other European countries. There are two main
reasons for this. First,  during the early-2000s will continue
to support growth in the working age population in the near-term.  However, rapidly
falling fertility rates since then, Ireland’s fertility rate was 1.5 in 2023, down from almost
2 in 2003, and converging on the EU average of 1.4, means that from the mid-2030s
onwards, Ireland has one of the fastest ageing populations in Europe, rapidly closing
current gaps in the dependency ratio, when compared to other countries. Central Bank
of Ireland analysis (PDF 1.19MB) projects the long-term growth rate of the economy to
slow by 2050 to below half its historic average growth rate observed over the last half
century.
relatively higher fertility rates

The second mitigating factor is migration. A 
 shows how inward migration has been central to Ireland’s
growth story. Over the period 1995-2020, all European countries saw an increase in the
share of international migrants in their population, but Ireland’s trajectory stands out:
from just over one-in-twenty international migrants in the population in 1995, by 2020
this was one-in-five, similar to figures for Austria, Germany and Sweden.  As the report
notes, while it can have large impacts, net migration is hard to predict, and, in the case
of Ireland at least, it has been historically under-predicted. However, even 
 of net migration returning to pre-pandemic levels of around
40,000 per year sees Ireland’s labour force growth stay in positive territory through to
2047. In a low migration scenario – just under half this level – the labour force starts to
contract much earlier, from 2041 onwards.
The point here is not so much to get bogged down in population or migration projection
scenarios – which, as I said, are highly uncertain – but rather to highlight the extent to
which migration can help mitigate the demographic and growth drag from ageing
populations and falling fertility rates. This could allow time for governments to develop
and implement other policies, mainly around labour force participation and productivity,
as I discuss in the final section of my speech.
Some final thoughts on migration.
The preceding discussion focuses on the direct impact of migration, that is, on numbers
in work. However, as , among others, has shown, migration supports
growth beyond direct effects. This includes the potential for positive net fiscal impacts,
i.e. taxes and contributions that migrants pay compared to the benefits and public
services they receive – fostering trade linkages and contributing to job creation and
entrepreneurship.
And while migration can offset some of drag on economic growth from unhelpful
demographic dynamics – as well as helping to 
, we cannot ignore the growing political and social resistance to immigration
in many countries.

fluctuations

For me it emphasises the importance of robust evidence and building a narrative that is
based on facts. Research has shown that perceptions about migration can be wide of
the mark, be it about the number and characteristics of migrants, or their economic
contribution to society. It is important that decision makers continue to have a solid
evidence base on the impact of migration on our economies, including how it interacts
with demographic trends. OECD research and analysis provides a valuable evidence
base to support effective decision-making.
Shrinking not sinking
Migration can mitigate some of the effects of the coming demographic changes, but it
cannot push back the tide. In this section, I now want to look at other how increasing
labour force participation and productivity growth can help.
As I have said previously, with shrinking populations, increasing labour force
participation is a necessary part of the solution. For the working age population, it is
important that reforms to tax and benefit systems remove disposable income cliff-edges
and tax wedges that can impinge on incentives to work. In this regard, ongoing 
 on how tax and benefit systems affect incentives to work provide an important
public policy role.
We also need to look beyond the traditional definition of working age population as 15-
60/64 years of age and boost participation in the post-60/65 population. In a world of
longer  and , sustaining living standards will need people to work
beyond what is currently considered ‘typical’ retirement age. A recent  on
making the labour market work for older workers puts it well:
“To sustain living standards and address structural labour shortages, many countries
will need people to work beyond 60 or 65. This requires labour market policies and
employer practices that support the hiring, retention and most importantly the
employability of mid-to-late career workers. Employers, employees, governments and
social partners all have a role in promoting lifelong learning, improving job quality and
promoting healthy workplaces to ensure the employability, well-being and economic
contribution of older workers in an evolving world of work.”

The impact of increased labour force participation in the post-60/65 population is
potentially large. Take the old-age dependency ratio as an example. Defining the
working age population as 15-69 instead of typical 15-64, and taking Eurostat’s current
population projections, the euro area dependency ratio in 2050 is 36.6 instead of 51.2;
in Ireland it ‘falls’ from 43.2 to 29.1.  To put these changes in context, allowing for a
‘high migration’ scenario in population projections results in a relatively small decrease
in the euro area 2050 dependency ratio, to just 48.9; for Ireland, it falls to 40.8.
Shifting our perceptions of the working age population can alleviate some unpleasant
demographic arithmetic. However, given relatively lower participation rates in general
for older workers, these effects likely represent the upper-end of potential upside
scenarios to raising participation rates. Having said that, labour force participation rates
have increased for the 65-69 age group in recent years, from 13 to 18 per cent in the
euro area between 2019 and 2025, and from 23 to 30 per cent in Ireland over the same
period. For comparison, the participation rate of 65-69 year olds in the US in 2024
was .
Thus far, my remarks have focused on the role of the size of the working age population
in growth. I will finish with a brief discussion on the other fundamental growth driver,
namely productivity.
In previous speeches I have highlighted the drivers of weak productivity growth in
Europe, and policies to try and improve it. On the policy front, implementing the
proposals in the  and  reports – mainly around completing the Savings and
Investment Union and removing barriers that restrict trade in goods and services in the
EU single market – must be a priority. You will not be surprised to hear that this was a
topic of conversation at last week’s meeting of EU Finance Ministers and Central Bank
Governors.

But here I want to talk specifically around developments in AI. We are still in the early
take-up phase of a technology that is itself rapidly evolving. But it is already clear that 
 are faster compared to historical episodes of new technology roll-outs,
such as the advent of the personal computer.  What we have seen so far in terms of
the , including in my own organisation, suggests that it has the potential to
disrupt existing employment patterns, both as a substitute for existing labour through
the automation of certain tasks and as a complement to existing skills.  Together, this
will create new opportunities for workforce growth and productivity gains. We need to
prepare now for the changes that are coming. This means, among other things, more
flexible labour markets that allow for worker mobility within and between firms, as well
as across sectors and occupations. It also means providing training opportunities for
workers – both younger and older – to drive upskilling and support transitions to new
roles that may not even exist yet.
In many ways, this is revisiting the ‘ ’ debate in Europe. Speaking at the OECD,
many of you will be familiar with the concept, but flexicurity is essentially about
balancing flexibility for employers and security for workers so that firms and workers
can adjust efficiently to economic changes and new technologies, while also
maintaining social inclusion and competitiveness.
In the early-2000s, flexicurity became synonymous with labour market structural
reforms.  As you will have seen from our , the ECB’s Governing
Council considers it important for governments to adopt growth-enhancing structural
reforms that can strengthen the euro area economy in the current environment.

In the context of AI, and given the 
, we must reduce both bureaucratic and financial hurdles to starting, and
scaling-up, a recurring theme in both the  and  reports.  Reforms that align
and streamline hiring procedures across the euro area will help to minimise risks to
firms of adopting new technology, as well as encouraging greater cross-country worker
mobility, which will be particularly important for high-demand digital or AI skills. Related
to this, mutual recognition of skills and aligning this to the national university and
vocational training programmes at the country level will help to balance supply and
demand for skills at a European level. Better coordination around the passporting of
worker benefits, be it pensions, training credits or even health insurance – would also
encourage mobility across firms, sectors and countries. As AI shifts the demand for
skills, active labour market programmes that focus on reskilling, not just younger, but
also mid-career workers, linking back to my earlier discussion – will be important.
Conclusion
Despite a series of negative shocks in recent years, employment in the euro area has
steadily grown, driven by strong post-pandemic demand and increased labour force
participation, bolstered by inward migration. Looking ahead, demographic shifts will
slow employment growth. Migration offers a partial solution, but the dividend from
raising labour force participation rates is arguably greater. And, we need to be thinking
about participation in the context of new generations living longer and healthier
lives.          
Raising productivity growth will be fundamental for sustaining living standards. The roll-
out and rapid adoption of AI has led to much hype about its productivity promise, but
the eventual impact remains highly uncertain.  Nonetheless, flexible labour markets and
proactive reskilling of workers across the age distribution will be essential to maximise
the productivity enhancing potential of these new technologies.
To sum up, what the data is telling us is that our societies are facing a series of
important choices if we want to sustain or improve our future living standards (or,
perhaps more accurately, for some of us at least, the living standards of our children
and grandchildren).

We could of course just accept that living standards will worsen but I see little evidence
that poorer living standards are likely to be tolerated by the majority of our citizens. I
suppose we could also see an increase in fertility rates but I am not sure this would
solve the challenge on its own and, on the evidence, that would require a significant
reversal in recent trends. 
Our choices are likely to involve improvements in our productivity, an increase in labour
market participation and inward migration. In my view a combination of these, they are
not mutually exclusive - offer us the most effective route to building the best
opportunities for our grandchildren. 
I do not suggest that this will be straightforward. To help us to choose well, we will need
researchers and organisations such as the OECD to set out the facts in an accessible
way and enable informed choices to be made by policymakers, and which can be
understood by our citizens.

tightness in the . In 2014, there were
more than ten unemployed persons for each job vacancy; by 2019, this had fallen to
around four unemployed persons for each job vacancy. Despite an initial collapse in job
vacancies (PDF 946.55KB) at the onset of the pandemic, the post-pandemic rebound
would see this ratio almost halve again.
[3] Monitoring wage dynamics after the inflation surge was important for monetary
policy makers concerned about ‘second round effects’ that could drive inflation
persistently about target. See for example, my November 2021 remarks “Inflation
dynamics in a pandemic: maintaining vigilance and optionality”, where I highlight this
risk. The development of more forward-looking and real-time wage trackers – such as

Central Bank of Ireland and the jobs site Indeed – have provided crucial information on
wage dynamics.

US labour force between 2022 and 2024. With euro area unemployment rates changing
little over this period, increases in the labour force map almost directly to increases in
employment.
[7] Beyond productivity effects, the concentration of migrant workers in certain sectors
is also notable. For example, healthcare in Ireland is a case-in-point. 
 (2023) show that almost one quarter of nurses and midwives were from
outside Ireland, while more than 7 in 10 new doctors registered in 2022 were trained
abroad.
[8] The slowdown in employment growth is not unique to Europe. For example, the IMF
WEO (April 2025) has employment growth in the United States at 0.5 per cent in 2026,
in part due to a large slowdown in inward migration. This is down from a 2021-23
average of almost 3 per cent.

[12] The ‘high migration’ scenario assumes 33 per cent more immigration than in the
baseline from non-EU countries in each year covering the projection horizon. For the
euro area, the baseline assumption is for approximately net 1 million non-EU migrants
each year from 2026 onwards, down from almost 4 million in 2022, a figure significantly
boosted by Ukrainian’s fleeing the war with Russia. For comparison, net immigration
into the EU from 2015-19 averaged 1.4 million per year.
