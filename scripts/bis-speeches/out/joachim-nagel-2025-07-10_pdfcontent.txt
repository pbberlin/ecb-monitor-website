1 Introduction
Thank you, Governor Müller, for your kind introduction and for the invitation. It is
a great pleasure and honour for me to speak here today. I truly appreciate the
warm hospitality of Eesti Pank. Since my arrival, I have spent an exciting
weekend enjoying several concerts, a trip to the Estonian wilderness, and a
walking tour of your beautiful Old Town. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Estonia and Germany are connected in surprising ways.
For example, the esteemed Estonian economist Ragnar Nurkse, in whose
honour this lecture series is being held, attended Tallinna Toomkool. The school
was also formerly known as the Domschule zu Reval, and its lessons were held in
German.
Estonia and Germany have also shared a similar economic fate in recent years:
Both countries’ economies have largely stagnated since the outbreak of the
COVID (coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic. 
The German economy: navigating cyclicalﬂuctuations and boosting long-term growth

2 German economy: current state and outlook
3 National policy measures to boost growth
4 The European dimension
5 Concluding remarks

Today, I want to share my thoughts on how the German economy reached its
current state and how it could recover. I will structure my remarks around three
key questions.
First, what is the current state of the German economy, and what are the main
drivers shaping the economic outlook?
Second, what national structural reforms could help put the German economy
back on a growth trajectory? 
And third, how can we work together to improve the European policy framework
to better support growth and security across the European Union?
2 German economy: current state and outlook
2.1 Current state of the economy
Let’s begin by examining the current state of the German economy. In 2024,
Germany’s annual real GDP (gross domestic product) was only 0.4 % higher than
in 2019. Similarly, Estonia’s economy remained largely stagnant at its 2019 level.
There are several reasons for this sobering growth experience in Germany. For
one thing, the economy has been signiﬁcantly impacted by recent crises. 
As one of the most globally interconnected economies, Germany experienced
supply chain disruptions during the COVID (coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic
more acutely than many other nations. Moreover, Germany’s heavy reliance on
Russian natural gas made it particularly vulnerable to the sharp rise in energy
prices.
Simultaneously, German industry has been experiencing a gradual loss in com‐
petitiveness in international markets. This decline is partly due to the increasing
strength of global competitors, especially from China. It had already taken root
well before the onset of the pandemic. 
In addition to these external challenges, there are also various, persistent inter‐
nal obstacles to growth, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Overall,
potential output growth stands at a modest 0.4 %, and without signiﬁcant policy
changes, it is likely to remain at this low level.

2.2 Economic outlook
Against the background of these structural challenges, what are the short-term
prospects of the German economy?
In the ﬁrst quarter of this year, the German economy grew by 0.4 %, rebounding
from a slight contraction at the end of last year. This growth was stronger than
anticipated, partly because concerns about rising tariﬀs resulted in shipments
being frontloaded. However, the underlying economic momentum remains
weak.
The Bundesbank’s June 2025 forecast indicates that the German economy is
expected to more or less stagnate this year. Factoring in the stronger-than-
expected ﬁrst-quarter growth ﬁgures, a slight annual increase appears possible.
However, this would still represent three consecutive years of minimal growth.
Our forecast aligns with recent predictions from the
IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the European Commission, both of which
project zero growth for 2025. The
OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) is slightly
more optimistic, projecting a growth rate of 0.4 %. Looking ahead, we see
promising signs of recovery.
In 2026, the Bundesbank projects that the German economy will grow by 0.7 %.
And in 2027, growth could reach 1.2 %. Compared to last December’s forecast,
the outlook for 2025 has thus been revised downward, while the forecast for
2027 has improved. The forecast is inﬂuenced by two opposing factors.
On one hand, the tariﬀ hikes and heightened uncertainty are estimated to
reduce the German economy’s growth by approximately three-quarters of a per‐
centage point. This impact is primarily expected to aﬀect growth in 2025 and
2026.
The baseline forecast assumes that the additional tariﬀs of at least 10 % imposed
on all US (United States) trading partners since April will remain in place.
Additionally, it accounts for the tariﬀs on steel and aluminium as well as on cars
and car parts. Finally, the forecast factors in a signiﬁcant increase in uncertainty,
in particular with regard to trade policy.

On the other hand, from 2026 onwards, the growth-dampening eﬀects of tariﬀs
are counterbalanced by positive growth impulses from German ﬁscal policy.
Signiﬁcant leeway for increased debt has been established, and deﬁcits are
expected to rise. Amongst other things, this leeway will be used to ﬁnance addi‐
tional defence and infrastructure spending. Our experts estimate that this extra
spending could boost economic growth by a total of three-quarters of a percent‐
age point by 2027.
In our baseline forecast, the two opposing forces in eﬀect broadly cancel each
other out. However, our projections are accompanied by considerable uncer‐
tainty. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and speciﬁcs of German economic
and ﬁscal policy all present risks. 
For instance, an escalation of the trade conﬂict could increase
GDP (gross domestic product) losses to one-and-a-half percentage points by
2027. In this risk scenario, the US (United States) tariﬀ hikes announced in early
April, some of which are currently suspended, would take full eﬀect. This would
be followed by renewed strong ﬁnancial market reactions and ongoing high
uncertainty regarding US (United States) economic policy. It is also assumed that
the EU (European Union) would retaliate with tariﬀs on a similar scale.
The situation remains ﬂuid, with both escalation and resolution of these tensions
being possible at any moment. Just to mention, in two days, on July 9th, the 90-
day pause on US (United States) reciprocal tariﬀs will conclude. We will see what
happens.
In summary, the German economy faces signiﬁcant headwinds in the short
term. Nevertheless, there are grounds for cautious optimism as we look to the
future. 
Before discussing policy measures to boost growth in Germany, let me take a
moment to digress. In observing the public debate in Germany, it appears that
the war in Ukraine still feels far removed for many people. 
This contrasts sharply with the situation in Estonia, where a direct neighbour has
become an immediate threat. Considering Estonia’s history and recurrent strug‐
gle for independence, one could say: “once more”.

My impression is that the new German government understands the gravity of
the situation. And I am conﬁdent that it will take the necessary steps to enhance
European security.
3 National policy measures to boost growth
Ladies and gentlemen, A politically strong Europe must be built on a solid eco‐
nomic foundation. And as we have seen, Germany has signiﬁcant room for
improvement in this regard. So, how can Germany enhance its growth
potential? 
A few months ago, I presented a comprehensive set of measures during a
speech in Berlin.  Let me summarise the key takeaways for you. I see three key
areas where policymakers can enhance Germany’s growth potential.
3.1 Increasing labour supply
The ﬁrst area that needs to be addressed urgently is labour supply. As the baby
boomers from the 1960s retire, the number of working individuals is declining,
which diminishes our growth potential. Accordingly, policymakers must explore
every avenue to increase labour supply in Germany.
One crucial option lies in increasing the working hours of part-time employees,
especially women. While the employment rate of women in Germany is slightly
above the European average, their weekly working hours are signiﬁcantly lower. 
This discrepancy partly stems from disincentives in the tax and social security
systems that discourage longer working hours. Moreover, the lack of an ade‐
quate supply of childcare and elderly care facilities limits part-time workers’
ability to increase their hours. Improving these facilities can pave the way for
longer working hours, thereby boosting our national labour supply.
Another key component is labour market-oriented migration. Currently, bureau‐
cratic hurdles and slow visa processes are hindering the eﬀective integration of
workers from non-EU (European Union) countries. This represents one of several
areas where Germany’s backlog in digitalising public services is hampering
growth. Simplifying recognition procedures for academic qualiﬁcations and cre‐
ating a centralised, digital point of contact for immigrants and their families can
facilitate smoother transitions. 
[1]

It is also vital to ensure that skilled workers remain in Germany over the long
term. Currently, within two years of entering the labour market, more than 30 %
of immigrants from other EU (European Union) countries leave again.
Enhancing language courses and granting residency rights for workers’ family
members can provide greater stability and integration.
Additionally, we need to improve work incentives for recipients of the civic
allowance. Research shows that the recent abolition of sanctions has signiﬁ‐
cantly decreased the transition of recipients into the labour market.
Reinstating previous rules on grace periods, protected assets, and reporting
obligations can help these individuals in their transition back to regular
employment.
Finally, we must harness the substantial potential of older individuals for addi‐
tional, often highly qualiﬁed labour.  Germany faces a unique challenge, as the
ratio of retirees to working-age individuals is expected to worsen signiﬁcantly
over the next 15 years compared to the
OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) average. 
To mitigate the increasing ratio of working to retirement years, it seems advis‐
able to link the earliest possible retirement age, and subsequently the retire‐
ment age after 2031, to life expectancy. The year 2031 is signiﬁcant, as by that
time, the regular retirement age will have been increased to 67.
Estonia serves as a role model in this context, as it will start linking retirement
age to average life expectancy in 2027. Germany would be wise to follow
Estonia’s example. 
Furthermore, it is time to reconsider the rule that permits early retirement
without deductions for individuals who have worked for 45 years. 
These measures would not only alleviate labour shortages and support eco‐
nomic growth, but also ease the ﬁnancial pressure on pension systems.
3.2 Eﬃciently transforming the energy sector
The second area that needs to be addressed is the transformation of the energy
sector. Germany aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. As a member of the
European Union, Estonia, too, is expected to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050
under the European Climate Law.

[5]

This monumental task will necessitate signiﬁcant investments in several key
sectors. To ensure the energy transition is as eﬃcient as possible, Germany
needs to adopt a comprehensive and cohesive strategy.
A key element of this strategy is implementing an eﬀective carbon pricing
system across all sectors and regions. Currently, carbon prices diﬀer across
sectors. However, only a standardised carbon price will ensure that savings are
made in the most cost-eﬀective areas. Therefore, it is crucial for Germany to
advocate for consistent carbon pricing within the EU (European Union) and other
economic regions.
Simultaneously, it is highly advisable to abolish climate-damaging subsidies.
These subsidies undermine the economic incentives of carbon pricing by pro‐
moting fossil fuel consumption.
Another essential component is establishing a reliable and coherent framework
for the energy transition. Given the long planning horizons and substantial
investments needed, a clear policy direction is essential. The government needs
to clarify how domestic renewable energy sources and energy imports will inter‐
act, considering potential supply bottlenecks, particularly during the winter
months. 
Moreover, policymakers should create economic incentives to better align elec‐
tricity supply and demand within Germany. Flexible electricity tariﬀs and innova‐
tive approaches such as bidirectional charging for electric vehicles can help
achieve this. 
3.3 Reviving business dynamism
The third area in which Germany has signiﬁcant room for improvement is busi‐
ness dynamism. Speciﬁcally, improved conditions for start-ups and business
investment are critical for guiding the German economy back onto a stronger
growth path.
What needs to be done?

To begin with, Germany should reduce excessive bureaucratic burdens.
Entrepreneurs often express frustration with increasing bureaucracy and regula‐
tion.  The National Regulatory Control Council (Normenkontrollrat) has identiﬁed
several promising avenues in this context. Moreover, implementing
EU (European Union) rules as sparingly and eﬃciently as possible can signiﬁ‐
cantly reduce compliance burdens. We should avoid “gold plating”, which refers
to adding extra layers of regulation at the national level. 
Rather, the focus should be on facilitating start-ups and enhancing innovative
capacity. Over one-half of company founders in Germany view bureaucratic
hurdles and delays as problematic.  Creating a “one-stop shop” for aspiring
entrepreneurs to manage all typical tasks related to starting a business can
unleash greater business dynamism. Innovative start-ups should be embraced,
beneﬁting from a large domestic market and suitable funding opportunities. 
Lastly, simplifying and expediting administrative processes is essential for reviv‐
ing business dynamism. Faster planning and approval procedures can help mod‐
ernise infrastructure more quickly. Moreover, digitalisation, automation, and
standardisation can all streamline administrative processes. 
In this context, Estonia and Germany diﬀer signiﬁcantly. According to the World
Bank, Estonia ranks among the most conducive countries for starting businesses
in the EU (European Union) – namely on position 14, while Germany ranks much
lower – namely on position 125.
The 2025 Spring Report from the German Council of Economic Experts provides
a detailed comparison of what it takes to start a company in both countries.
The diﬀerences are striking. 
Estonia’s approach to founding a company exempliﬁes eﬃciency, featuring a
fully digital, centralised system that enables entrepreneurs to complete the
process quickly and with minimal bureaucracy.

The entire procedure can be completed online through a one-stop shop for
administrative services known as the “e-Business Register”. It employs a stan‐
dardised template and allows users to apply for a VAT (value added tax) number
at the same time. The costs of starting a company in Estonia are relatively low.
Moreover, authorities process applications within ﬁve working days, or within
one day if the expedited option is selected. 
This eﬃcient, fully digital system positions Estonia as a leader in facilitating
entrepreneurship. 
By contrast, Germany’s process is more fragmented, necessitating interaction
with multiple authorities and requiring signiﬁcantly more time and eﬀort.
Founders must consult several institutions, including notaries, the local court,
the trade oﬃce, the tax oﬃce, and the Federal Employment Agency if they plan
to hire employees. Additionally, the costs of starting a company in Germany are
considerably higher. Moreover, it takes an average of 35 days, which is consider‐
ably longer.
This is certainly another area where I believe Germany should follow Estonia’s
lead.
4 The European dimension
Implementing rigorous structural reforms at the national level is essential for
boosting Germany’s growth potential. However, for certain issues, we need to
ﬁnd solutions and make progress at the European level.
4.1 Addressing geoeconomic and geopolitical challenges
One aspect of this is developing a uniﬁed European response to the geoeco‐
nomic and geopolitical threats we face today. Europe is currently being con‐
fronted with an erratic and confrontational US (United States) trade policy. 
So far, the European Commission has made every eﬀort to de-escalate the situa‐
tion. Simultaneously, however, the Commission is prepared to retaliate. I believe
this is a reasonable approach. 

Overall, Europe should remain committed to a rule-based international trade
order and pursue free trade agreements with like-minded countries and regions.
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s recent proposal to enhance coop‐
eration between the EU (European Union) and members of the Comprehensive
and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership (
CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-PaciﬁcPartnership)
) represents a welcome and appropriate step in that direction.
Regarding geopolitics, Europe must assume greater responsibility for its own
defence. In this context, it is crucial to enhance European coordination, including
with non-EU (European Union) countries such as Norway and the United
Kingdom, in military strategy, deployment, personnel build-up, procurement,
and production capacities. This coordination will incur minimal ﬁscal costs and
may even save money through increased synergies. 
The EU (European Union) Commission’s “Readiness 2030” initiative aims to create
space for additional national defence spending within the Stability and Growth
Pact. I consider such temporary additional leeway for defence expenditure to be
reasonable. It will enable European countries to act swiftly and adapt gradually
to permanently higher defence spending.
Lastly, Europe should enhance its autonomy in the payments sector. Currently,
Europe remains largely dependent on non-European payment providers. We still
lack a digital payment solution that functions across the entire euro area and
operates on European infrastructure. 
Introducing a digital euro in both retail and wholesale variants could be a cor‐
nerstone for true autonomy in payments. I would encourage legislators to push
forward with the digital euro project accordingly.
4.2 Boosting European integration
The second dimension we must focus on is fostering European integration.

The European Single Market has been a cornerstone of prosperity to date, allow‐
ing goods to ﬂow freely across borders while fostering competition, innovation,
and economic growth. However, signiﬁcant barriers still exist when it comes to
services. Cross-border trade in services is still far less developed than in goods,
partly due to national regulations that restrict professional services such as legal
advice, architecture, and engineering. While some regulations are justiﬁed,
many are not, resulting in ineﬃciencies and lost opportunities.
The digital revolution presents a unique opportunity to overcome these obsta‐
cles. Digital platforms, virtual collaboration, and online services are revolutionis‐
ing how businesses operate and interact. To fully harness this potential, we need
to simplify regulations, reduce administrative burdens, and establish a truly
uniﬁed digital marketplace. For example, the centralised EU (European Union)
digital portal for public services established by the European Commission is a
welcome step towards facilitating cross-border employment for professionals.
This serves as a mechanism to give citizens easier access to services in other
Member States. 
By eliminating unjustiﬁed obstacles, we can unlock the full potential of the Single
Market, enhance competitiveness, and ensure that Europe remains a global
leader in innovation. 
Energy is another area where deeper European integration can yield signiﬁcant
beneﬁts. Europe’s energy markets are still fragmented, with infrastructure bot‐
tlenecks and national boundaries restricting the eﬃcient ﬂow of electricity. 
A more integrated European electricity market would enable us to better align
supply and demand across borders, reduce reliance on costly reserve power
plants, and accelerate the transition to renewable energy. To achieve this, we
need to invest in cross-border infrastructure, modernise our grids, and eliminate
regulatory obstacles that impede energy trade. By collaborating, we can not only
achieve our climate goals but also enhance Europe’s energy security and com‐
petitiveness in a rapidly evolving global landscape. 
Last but not least, we must deepen the integration of European ﬁnancial
markets. The European Savings and Investments Union can help mobilise the
necessary ﬁnancing for additional investments, such as, for instance, for the
green transition and the enhancement of defence capabilities.

Three key elements are at play here.
First, the European Savings and Investments Union can help diversify funding
sources. Enhancing access to equity, market-based debt ﬁnancing and venture
capital will enable the ﬁnancing of a broader range of investments.
Second, the European Savings and Investments Union will facilitate cross-border
investments by harmonising regulations and breaking down barriers. This would
ease the formation of pan-European companies, enabling them to harness cost-
lowering economies of scale.
This point echoes Ragnar Nurske’s “balanced growth theory”. Tailored to the situ‐
ation of high-income economies, one could paraphrase him in the following way:
The limited size of the domestic market can constitute an obstacle to the applica‐
tion of capital by ﬁrms or industries, thus posing an obstacle to economic
growth generally.
Third, the European Savings and Investments Union will make Europe more
appealing to external investors. This would increase both the quantity of avail‐
able ﬁnancing and reduce its cost. 
Recent policy actions by the US (United States) administration have led interna‐
tional investors to start questioning the US (United States) dollar’s safe haven
status and to reassess the relative attractiveness of Europe as an investment
location compared to the US (United States). Boosting growth in the
EU (European Union) and making it an attractive investment destination
presents an opportunity for Europe.
5 Concluding remarks
Ladies and gentlemen, Allow me to brieﬂy summarise and share a few conclud‐
ing thoughts.
I began my speech by noting that economic growth has been weak in both
Germany and Estonia over the past few years. In Germany’s case, the economy is
currently navigating a combination of cyclical ﬂuctuations and structural
challenges. 
[10]

This is a pivotal moment – a time for reﬂection, decisive action, and bold leader‐
ship. I am optimistic that the new German government will address the struc‐
tural issues with determination and help its economy to become one of Europe’s
growth engines. 
In light of today’s geopolitical and geoeconomic uncertainties, Europe’s role is
more crucial than ever. Let us seize this opportunity to deepen European integra‐
tion and emerge stronger together. 
If we take the right actions, I am conﬁdent that our two economies will soon
share two key outcomes once again: vibrant economic growth and enduring
security.
For now, I eagerly anticipate our discussion here and my ongoing conversations
with Governor Müller. I look forward to exchanging ideas and the opportunity to
learn from each other. Thank you for your attention.
