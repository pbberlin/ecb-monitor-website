SPEECH
Modern monetary analysis
Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the
ECB, at the Bank of Finland’s International Monetary Policy
Conference
Helsinki, 26 June 2024
Introduction
My aim today is to discuss the modern role of monetary analysis at the ECB.“ | will first review how
monetary analysis has advanced over the twenty-five year history of the euro. Second, | will discuss
how monetary analysis contributed to the assessment of financing conditions during the pandemic.
Third, | will explain how monetary analysis has informed the diagnosis of the post-pandemic surges in
inflation. Fourth, | will examine the contributions of monetary analysis to the calibration of the tightening
cycle. Finally, | will speculate on the future role of monetary analysis.
The evolving role of monetary analysis
The initial monetary policy strategy of the ECB was based on a two-pillar framework to identify risks to
price stability: economic analysis and monetary analysis. The two analytical domains essentially
provided complementary perspectives on the economy.
For the monetary pillar, the ECB’s Governing Council initially chose to emphasise the quantity of money
among the key indicators to be closely monitored and established a reference value for the growth of a
broad monetary aggregate (M3).
This approach was in line with the views of early-day monetarists who considered money growth the
primary source of inflation. Milton Friedman famously captured this in the adage that “inflation is always
and everywhere a monetary phenomenon’. In an admittedly restrictive interpretation of Friedman’s
statement, this is reflected in the quantity identity MV=PY.4! This school of thought saw money as an
imperfect substitute for a wide range of financial and real assets. A policy-induced injection of money
into the economy would trigger complex and inter-related portfolio rebalancing across asset categories.
This rebalancing would then lead to widespread changes in asset prices, yields and spreads across the
economy. These mechanisms are well described in the classic 1988 monetarist account of transmission
by Karl Brunner and Alan Meltzer,
Especially after the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1973, some stability-oriented central banks —
most notably the Deutsche Bundesbank — were looking for a substitute anchor, and these monetarist
considerations played a significant role in the conduct of monetary policy throughout the 1970s, 1980s
and 1990s. The result of that intellectual legacy was the prominent role that the ECB assigned to a
reference value for money growth as an anchor back in 1998. Deviations from that reference value


and the associated “monetary overhang/shortfall” were, at the time, generally considered to signal risks
to price stability.
However, a consistent record of difficulties within central banks in interpreting swings in monetary
aggregates and in relying on them for predicting inflation at the horizons relevant for monetary policy
contributed to a declining emphasis on money in policy making. As early as 1983, Bank of Canada
Governor Gerald Bouey famously quipped “/ would not say that we abandoned M7; | would say that M1
abandoned us, because of changes in banking practices”4 Even though Bouey was speaking about
M1, the same instability problem applied to M3.
Moreover, by the time Michael Woodford came to write his seminal text Interest and Prices in 2003,
there was a wide-spread view that it was not necessary to incorporate money in modern
macroeconomic models.! Rather, the monetary policy stance could be summarised by the setting of
interest rates alone. Accordingly, money was all but removed from the modem monetary economics
synthesis.
Against this background, the ECB conducted a review of its monetary policy strategy in 2003. This
resulted in a revised approach to monetary analysis under the monetary pillar, with the adoption of a
broader view of the role of money in the economy and the financial system. The long-term empirical
relation between money and inflation had consistently been proven unhelpful in quantifying the scale of
price pressures on a meeting-by-meeting basis. This realisation led to the discontinuation of the earlier
practice of reviewing the reference value for M3, with a shift towards treating money aggregates as
indicator variables rather than intermediate targets for monetary policy. The 2003 strategy review also
clarified that monetary analysis served as a tool for cross-checking the short to medium-term
indications from the economic analysis, from a medium to long-term perspective. 4
After 2003, two significant developments led to an increased focus of monetary analysis on monetary
policy transmission. First, the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis highlighted
the vulnerability of the transmission mechanism. This, in turn, prompted policymakers to place greater
reliance on monetary analysis in navigating the resulting challenges. Second, the adoption of
unconventional monetary policy tools by the ECB of required monetary analysis to broaden its scope to
better understand the many new transmission channels that the adoption of unconventional
instruments had set in motion, including the analysis of potential side effects of those measures.
Overall, the shift in focus of monetary analysis towards monetary policy transmission represented a
natural evolution in line with the changing monetary policy landscape.
These developments were incorporated in monetary analysis during the latest strategy review
conducted in 2021. In the new framework, “economic analysis” and “monetary analysis” no longer
represent distinct perspectives on inflation. Instead, the interrelations between economic developments
and monetary and financial developments are explicitly integrated into the overall assessment of
inflation risks and the formulation of monetary policy.)
Accordingly, monetary analysis has expanded from a narrow focus on the quantity of money to the
wider mechanism by which monetary policy actions transmit to the financing conditions faced by
households and firms in the real economy, 14] This approach often employs monetarist concepts,


formalised within modern structural models, to analyse changes in spreads and asset prices linked to
portfolio rebalancing across imperfectly substitutable financial assets, including money and money-type
assets15]
Monetary analysis played a particularly salient role in policy decision-making when the policy rate
approached the effective lower bound. This period sawa significant expansion of liquidity in the
financial system through central bank lending programmes and outright asset purchases, underscoring
the importance of informed decision-making based on monetary analysis.
In the quantity identity (MV=PY), the traditional emphasis had primarily been on the growth rate of
money, M. However, the bi-variate relation between inflation and money growth had not only always
been elusive but also weakened over time, before disappearing altogether in the first decade of the
2000s (Chart 1).{“4] Past studies had found a significant and stable relation between broad money
growth and inflation across several economies and monetary regimes. However, this relation was
observed at very low frequency over extremely long periods, limiting the degree to which it can be used
in practice at the meeting-by-meeting frequency required for policy decisions.“5] Moreover, research
incorporating recent experiences finds that structural shifts in banking and the financial system have
destabilised the relation between money supply and inflation.
Precisely for these reasons, since the global financial crisis, the importance of the bank lending channel
and other transmission mechanisms has become more prominent. Monetary analysis has adapted by
increasing the emphasis on analysing the credit-creation process, its relation with liquidity conditions
and the various frictions affecting the financial system. All these elements affect the transmission of
monetary policy to the real economy and thereby contribute to inflation dynamics.

The latest observations are for 2024 Q1.
From this perspective, it would be overly reductive to interpret the rise of money growth during the
pandemic and the subsequent rise in inflation that is shown in Chart 1 as a causal relation. In fact, the
strong money growth in the early phase of the pandemic was driven by the build-up of liquidity buffers,
which is not inherently inflationary. This is consistent with the view that the surges in inflation in 2021
and 2022 were mostly related to supply-side factors, such as global supply bottlenecks and increases
in energy and commodity prices, rather than an increased stock of money. This view is further
reinforced by the nature of the inflation shock which involved large relative price movements, whereas
money-induced inflation should have been associated with a more uniform increase in prices across
categories. | will return to the pandemic episode later in this speech.
The wider availability of timely granular information on balance sheets, lending rates and deposit rates
for euro area monetary financial institutions has offered increasingly detailed insights into bank-based
transmission. We now have evidence that firm and bank balance sheet constraints can amplify the
contraction in credit availability brought about by policy tightening.“2) More recently, the availability of
loan- and transaction-level information on banks and firms has further enhanced the analysis of the
monetary policy transmission mechanism along several dimensions, including: heterogeneity in the
transmission of monetary policy across regions and sectors, the impact of monetary policy on bank
risk-taking, and the sources of changes in credit developments.
Financing conditions during the pandemic


The pandemic period was marked by extraordinarily high liquidity demand, triggering a global dash for
cash by investors. Lockdowns, social distancing measures and travel restrictions led many firms to
experience a reduction in consumer demand and to reduce or halt their operations. This triggered a
substantial decline in revenue for businesses across a wide range of sectors. However, firms still had to
meet operating expenses and short-term obligations, such as the maintenance of inventories,
payments to suppliers, salaries, taxes and fixed operational expenses. These needs showed up very
clearly in the replies by banks to the ECB bank lending survey (BLS), which documented a surge in
loan demand by firms to finance working capital, while financing needs linked to investment weakened
considerably (Chart 2)./29

Notes: Net percentages for the questions on demand for loans are defined as the difference between the sum of
the percentages of banks responding “increased considerably” and “increased somewhat” and the sum of the
percentages of banks responding “decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably’. The net percentages for
responses to questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of
banks reporting that the given factor contributed to increasing demand and the percentage of banks reporting that
it contributed to decreasing demand.
The latest observations are for Q1 2024.
In this environment, employment and total hours worked declined at the sharpest rates on record, with
many employees being furloughed or having their working hours reduced. Consequently, salary
incomes were dented. Banks across the euro area faced rising funding costs due to a climate of
heightened uncertainty in the market and concerns about borrower creditworthiness. This led to a


reassessment of risk, affecting not only banks but also the broader financial markets, as evidenced by
the increase in corporate bond yields. In the absence of countervailing measures, banks would have
struggled to secure funding, which would have limited their ability to meet the high demand for
emergency loans, potentially crippling their lending capacity. Accordingly, it was crucial for our
monetary policy to maintain favourable financing conditions and the effective transmission of monetary
policy, in order to avert a monetary squeeze that would have exacerbated adverse effects from the
pandemic on the economy and price stability.
The experience gained over the preceding decade allowed us to respond swiftly and decisively,
deploying essentially two types of instruments. The first type was intended to maintain an
accommodative monetary policy stance and, in parallel, stem the tide of an impending meltdown in
financial markets as investors were pulling back from riskier assets. Here the main measures were the
recalibration of the asset purchase programme (APP) and the introduction of the pandemic emergency
purchase programme (PEPP). 2422] The second group of instruments was deployed to ensure that the
accommodative impulse would reach the broader economy. Notable examples include the
recalibrations of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) for banks at attractive
conditions.25! These term credit operations were aimed at expanding the quantity of central bank
reserves, subject to the condition that banks would lend them on and keep credit flowing to the
economy. As a facilitating measure, the targeted lending programme was accompanied by a temporary
easing of collateral and regulatory constraints.
The interplay between policies to keep the risk-free curve low and steady across maturities, and
instruments to unclog the transmission pipes worked as intended. The economics of the portfolio
rebalancing channel learned during the first wave of the APP net purchases, over the period 2015-
2018, as well as the experience of the portfolio movements during the sovereign debt crisis, were
instrumental for the design of the PEPP. The portfolio rebalancing channel is the key mechanism
through which central bank asset purchases transmits monetary policy to the broader economy. 4] This
channel functions through the principle of imperfect substitutability among financial instruments,
coupled with investor preferences for certain assets, known as preferred habitats 1251
Monetary analysis studied how portfolio allocations can change directions both across instruments and
between euro-denominated domestic assets and foreign assets. Within the euro area, the APP had led
to a rebalancing of bank exposures from sovereign securities towards corporate securities and from
bonds to real-sector loans, easing financing conditions to corporates and households in the process. 24]
The shift towards foreign assets had been more pronounced among foreign investors, who were the
main selling sector counterpart in the APP during the pre-pandemic period, but it was also evident
among euro area investors (Chart 3).24 This had played a significant role in explaining the limited
effect that the APP had on the expansion of broad money supply before the pandemic, a phenomenon
that was similarly observed during the third round of quantitative easing in the United States (Chart 4).
In other words, the APP had exerted robust monetary transmission even in the absence of a strong
expansion in the money supply, because the exchange rate channel had become a powerful substitute
for the traditional money-creation mechanism that worked through the liability side of bank balance
sheets.

The long-standing internal monetary analysis of the factors explaining the setting of bank lending rates
was Critical in the recalibration of existing TLTROs during the pandemic. In particular, the pricing of the
new wave of TLTROs following the outbreak of the pandemic relied on the accumulated evidence that
the unconventional policies deployed by the ECB had lowered various components of bank funding
costs in the aftermath of the euro area sovereign debt crisis (Chart 5), 28] Empirical estimates indicate
that, in the absence of the recalibration of the targeted lending programme, the ability of banks to
supply credit would have been severely affected. Importantly, the lower amount of lending to firms
would have led to a significantly larger decline in employment by firms.221

The post-pandemic surges in inflation
The combination of extraordinarily high liquidity needs and our monetary policy measures to maintain
favourable financing conditions boosted broad money growth. As a result, credit to firms and central
bank purchases became the main sources of money creation. This composition reflected the broad
division of tasks in the support given to the euro area economy, with the support to the corporate sector
mostly channelled via bank credit (whose conditions were eased by monetary policy, government
guarantees and regulatory measures) while the support to households was mostly channelled via the
government sector. The latter, and thus the liquidity needs of the economy, explain the marked impact
of central bank purchases on money growth in the early stages of the pandemic. In contrast to the
2015-2018 period, these purchases occurred alongside an increase in government borrowing. Such
borrowing prevented the bond scarcity that large-scale asset purchases can imply, thereby averting the
usual financial outflows to the rest of the world (Chart 4, left panel).
As economic activity resumed and lockdown restrictions were lifted, emergency liquidity needs declined
and money growth also slowed. By October 2020, the three-month annualised growth rate of M3 had
dropped to 7.5 per cent, which was about one-third of the 21.9 per cent rate seen at the peak of the
lockdowns, and just somewhat above the historical average. The growth rate continued to decrease
until mid-2022 even in the face of increased borrowing prompted by liquidity demands from the energy


crisis. Shortly after we started hiking rates in July 2022, M3 growth even dipped into negative territory
before recovering somewhat in the second half of 2023.
Inflation began to rise just as money growth slowed down. Initially, these price increases were
concentrated in specific sectors, particularly affecting energy and food prices, rather than showing a
broad-based increase across all goods and services, which would have been more consistent with a
monetary origin for the inflation surge (Chart 6). These heterogeneous price increases align with the
view that inflation was largely due to specific cost-push shocks passing through to the wider
consumption basket. This perspective is supported by structural analyses identifying energy and food
price shocks together with supply chain disruptions as the main culprits of the inflationary pressures.221
It is also consistent with the interpretation that the robust money growth during the early stages of the
pandemic was a result of accumulating liquidity reserves, which in turn were not inherently inflationary.
Taken together, the evidence indicates that the recent inflation surge is primarily attributable to rising
commodity prices and global supply constraints, rather than an expanding money supply.24

The latest observations are for April 2024.
The surge in borrowing by firms, which peaked during the second quarter of 2020 amid the initial
lockdowns, was primarily driven by need for working capital and precautionary reasons. Borrowing by
firms closely matched their increases in cash reserves. Since this borrowing was not for investment
purposes, it did not stimulate aggregate demand.
Household behaviour points to a similar message. Government aid to households served to cushion
their reduced income rather than to increase spending: fiscal transfers only covered part of the
slowdown in household income over the pandemic period. Most of the excess savings accumulated
during the pandemic resulted from falling consumption, which was much larger than the drop in income
(Chart 7, left panel). This decline in consumption was partly forced by the reduced consumption
opportunities due to the pandemic restrictions but it is likely to have also reflected precautionary
behaviour related to uncertainty about the future. The latter led to an increased preference for liquidity,


and indeed a large part of household excess savings were accumulated in the form of overnight
deposits, especially in the initial phases of the pandemic (Chart 7, right panel).241

Consumption only started to approach its pre-pandemic level by the middle of 2021, but households
continued to express their willingness to maintain a higher level of savings or financial investments, a
considerable part of which remained in overnight deposits. This composition also reflected the
flattening yield curve and the low opportunity cost of holding those deposits.221

The latest observations are for 2022.
As energy and food prices began to rise, households moderated their accumulation of deposits but also
reduced the real consumption of those products (Chart 8). The configuration of falling consumption and
rising prices for energy and food is consistent with supply shocks driving energy and food prices rather
than reflecting a surge in domestic demand.! In addition, falling consumption also indicates that the
excess deposits accumulated during the pandemic did not lead to households being insensitive to more
expensive and energy and food bills.
Chart 8 also shows that, as the economy reopened and uncertainty receded, household consumption
volumes of items other than energy and food rebounded towards pre-pandemic levels despite the price
increases in those items in the course of 2021 and 2022. While the configuration of rising consumption
and rising prices might suggest some role for domestic demand, consumption of these items remained
clearly below the previous trend. It is certainly the case that, for a given surge in supply-driven inflation,
excess savings allowed households to cut consumption by less than if the supply shock had happened
at a time when excess savings were lower.
The coexistence of high inflation and only a moderate consumption recovery serves to underline the
scale of supply-driven cost pressures during 2021 and 2022: only a dramatic monetary and/or fiscal
tightening would have been needed to eliminate the inflation surge by reducing domestic demand
sufficiently (involving a severe drop in domestic incomes) to match the reduction in supply capacity.
Overall, although real private consumption and investment have rebounded in the post-pandemic
period, these have not reached the levels projected in mid-2021 when excess savings were at their


highest, and real private consumption continues to trail the forecasts made before the pandemic. In this
context a dramatic recession would have been required to fully avoid an inflation surge.22!
The tightening cycle
Monetary analysis has been central to the regular assessment of the state of the monetary policy
transmission, which has been a key guiding principle in calibrating the speed and scale of the monetary
policy tightening over the last couple of years, 26]
Focusing on the propagation of that tightening impulse through the banks, both the rate hikes that
started in July 2022 and the sustained upshift in the yield curve that preceded and accompanied that
process led to a significant rise in bank funding costs, initially driven by bonds and subsequently by
deposit rates (Chart 9). The latter adjusted with a lag, owing to the atypical interest rate configuration
during the negative rate period, but eventually aligned with our policy signal (Chart 10).

In parallel, loan volumes in the euro area have experienced a marked decline since late 2022. After
dropping sharply, credit flows have remained stagnant for both loans and bonds (Chart 11, left panel).
The pronounced decline in credit compared to previous hiking cycles (Chart 11, right panel) was largely
due to the sharp increase in interest rates, which has significantly dampened demand, as also reflected
in the ECB bank lending survey (BLS). Initially, credit demand showed some resilience, primarily driven
by the liquidity needs of firms during the peak of the energy crisis. However, it began to contract in the


last quarter of 2022 and continued to do so for several months after the last rate hike in September
2023. The primary drivers behind the weakness in demand were elevated interest rates and reduced
recourse to credit for financing investments, which reflects the "cost of capital” channel of monetary
policy (Chart 12).

Notes: Net percentages for the questions on demand for loans are defined as the difference between the sum of
the percentages of banks responding “increased considerably” and “increased somewhat” and the sum of the
percentages of banks responding “decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably’. The net percentages for
responses to questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of
banks reporting that the given factor contributed to increasing demand and the percentage of banks reporting that
it contributed to decreasing demand. “Other financing needs’ is the unweighted average of “mergers/acquisitions
and corporate restructuring” and “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation’; and “Use of alternative finance”
is the unweighted average of “internal financing’, “loans from other banks’, “loans from non-banks’,
“issuance/redemption of debt securities” and “issuance/redemption of equity”. The net percentages for “Other
factors” refer to an average of the further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes
in loan demand.
The latest observations are for 2024 Q1.
At the same time, a decline in the supply of credit from banks has also played a large role in the recent
credit slowdown. Credit supply effects primarily stemmed from a decreasing willingness of banks to
take risks. This, in turn, has affected lending conditions for firms and households. The start of the
reimbursement phase for TLTROs and the change in the conditions applied by on TLTRO borrowings
reinforced the incentives for banks to scale down loan exposures. 24 Studies using granular data to
control for demand conditions indicate that increased borrowing costs for banks have resulted in a
significant reduction in lending volumes. In other words, the significant decrease in loans was partly
due to the tighter lending conditions, rather than being solely due to lower credit demand. Our bank
lending survey corroborates this view, highlighting that heightened risk perception and reduced risk
tolerance on the part of banks were significant factors influencing the tightening of credit standards
during the hiking cycle.


In parallel, money growth, which had been declining rapidly from its 2021 peak, saw its decline
accelerate, mirroring the contemporary contraction in bank lending and the progressive reduction of the
monetary policy securities portfolio of the Eurosystem. Two liability-side factors reinforced the
contraction in the availability of cheap funding: first, banks substituting TLTRO funding for long-term
bonds; and second, a strong portfolio rebalancing by households and firms on the liability side of bank
balance sheets.
In particular, the increased remuneration of time deposits and bonds after a long period of low or
negative interest rates has incentivised shifts to these instruments from overnight deposits and other
low-remuneration deposits. During the period of low interest rates, the opportunity cost of holding
overnight deposits was very low, causing households and firms to prefer overnight deposits. The
monetary policy tightening and its transmission to deposit rates and yields on other financial assets,
has increased the opportunity cost of holding overnight deposits to levels similar to those seen in
previous hiking cycles. This has led households and firms to move a significant portion of their
unusually large stock of overnight deposits to time deposits and bonds (Chart 13), 35]
The high level of liquidity within the banking system has not impeded the transmission of our monetary
policy tightening to households and businesses. Although in the cross-section banks with greater
excess liquidity at the onset of the tightening cycle have reduced their lending to a lesser extent than
their less liquid peers, the overall transmission of monetary policy has been robust and, if anything,
been stronger than in previous cycles.
The apparent differences between the cross-sectional and time series results can be reconciled as
follows. From a theoretical standpoint, excess reserves on the balance sheets of banks exert dual
effects during a period of monetary tightening. On one side, the initiation of an unexpected tightening
phase allows banks with excess reserves to benefit from higher returns on these reserves. This helps
bolster their profits, potentially augments their capital buffers, relaxes constraints and ultimately
expands the supply of lending. This wealth effect is in line with the results of the cross-sectional
analysis. 22] At the same time, as the remuneration of reserves increases, these reserves become
increasingly attractive to banks, as these represent a highly remunerated, secure and liquid asset. As a
result, banks may be reluctant to extend their lending or to invest in bonds unless the price of these
financial instruments is sufficiently attractive. This substitution effect may well have been the prevailing
force in the aggregate transmission of our monetary policy.4°lThat is to say, while the wealth effect may
explain the cross-sectional variation in lending behaviour among banks with differing levels of excess
liquidity, the substitution effect likely contributed to the strong transmission of monetary tightening on an
aggregate level.
As the quantity-theory expression MV=PY makes clear, the connection between outside money — the
currency and reserves supplied by the central bank — and prices is mediated by adjustments in velocity.
Velocity is a complex function of a host of factors, some of which pertain to the decisions by banks to
intermediate credit, others having to do with the decisions by different types of money holders on the
financial instruments in which they want to keep their wealth. All else equal, credit creation pushes up
velocity and thereby, for a given level of real income, generates price pressures. Conversely, portfolio
reallocations towards larger money holdings serves to reduce velocity and weaken inflation for a given
stock of outside money.


In a nutshell, these two factors have been offsetting each other in recent years. When loans were
rapidly expanding in the early phase of the pandemic crisis, a sharp rise in liquidity preference — and
the short-term bridging nature of the loans themselves — attenuated the inflationary potential of money
growth. When eventually portfolios started shedding excess liquidity — a potential source of inflation —
loans began to decline in parallel, providing a cushion against money-generated inflationary pressures.

Future challenges
Looking ahead, a prominent challenge for monetary analysis is to understand how the normalisation of
the balance sheets of central banks may affect transmission in the years to come.
Measures that expand the central bank balance sheet stimulate bank lending and risk-taking through
three main channels. First, the decrease in long-term interest rates associated with the purchases of
long-term securities by the central bank lowers borrowing costs for businesses and consumers,
ultimately stimulating their loan demand. Second, investors (including banks and other financial
institutions) that sell assets to the central bank try to rebalance their portfolio towards higher-yielding
investments, which can also lead to increased lending supply.441 Third, the liquidity injected into the
banking system via central bank purchases of financial assets can enhance the capacity of banks to
lend because that type of liquidity, perceived to remain in the system for a long time, may be seen as
providing a permanent means to service the mobile type of deposits that are the by-product of an
extension of bank credit.


In studying this critical nexus with the help of monetary analysis, it is worth recalling the notion of the
“money multiplier’. Based on this mechanism, in a fractional reserve banking system a policy-induced
expansion of the free reserves of cash held by the banks spurs, through successive rounds of loan and
deposit creation, increasing volumes of credit and inside money. Outright central bank asset purchases
increase bank reserve holdings and prompt banks to try to minimise the associated liquidity surplus —
which is costly — by creating credit and other claims on those surplus reserves in an effort to enhance
shareholder returns. This mechanism helps explain the strong connection of credit with reserve
creation in times of QE, even when controlling for demand-for-credit effects as lending rates decline as
a result of QE. In the other direction, a withdrawal of reserves sets in motion a cumulative process by
which credit and deposits shrink by a multiple of the original negative shock to the reserve holdings.42]
It follows that, in order to assess the implications of QT, it is important to trace all the implications of the
central bank balance sheet contraction for asset prices and credit in an encompassing framework and
to take into account the relation between central bank liquidity and bank intermediation capacity.“
The relevance of the money multiplier is also supported by recent empirical analysis using
comprehensive bank-level and loan-level data on lending from euro area banks to firms. A recent ECB
study draws two main conclusions. First, the availability of central bank liquidity significantly influences
banks' credit provision, in what the authors call a “reserve availability channel” of monetary policy.
Second, the source of central bank reserves affects their impact on bank intermediation: non-borrowed
reserves — those created as a result of a securities purchase programme — have very strong empirical
connection with bank loans, whereas this is not the case for borrowed reserves drawn by banks from a
short-term refinancing facility (Chart 14).4°]

Notes: The chart reports the response of bank loans after a 1pp increase in non-borrowed reserves (left side) and
borrowed reserves (right side). The solid lines report the estimated response, while the dashed lines report the
95% confidence intervals for each horizon.
These mechanisms are in line with a growing body of empirical studies focusing on the relation
between central bank reserves and bank lending. Examples include analyses that show that: (a) banks
that increased their reserve holdings, following the third round of quantitative easing announced by the
Federal Reserve, increased lending; (b) banks with higher excess reserve holdings grant more credit
lines and take more risk; (c) the reallocation of central bank reserves towards banks with higher liquidity
needs fosters credit supply; and (d) the credit supply of reserve-rich banks is less sensitive to monetary
policy tightening than that of other banks. 44]
Conclusions
As | have covered in this lecture, modern monetary analysis is helping policymakers to analyse the
nexus of money, credit and the economy. Moreover, the frontier in modern monetary analysis is
continuing to expand: the enhanced availability of granular data, filtered through an expanding
computation capacity and new machine learning techniques, is further broadening its scope and the
relevance of its findings for the calibration of monetary policy. For these reasons, monetary analysis


plays a central role at the ECB, with a data-dependent approach to assessing the effectiveness of
monetary policy transmission a key element in our reaction function.

term “modern monetary analysis” is intended to capture the current role of monetary analysis in central
banking, as opposed to a traditional interpretation of the role of monetary analysis. The framework of
modern monetary analysis is not to be confused with the much-discussed framework of modern
monetary theory.

To be sure, the quantity identity predates Friedman’s statement by a couple of centuries, as it is already
clearly implicit in David Hume’s “Political Discourses” (1752), although the “V” part of the equation was
certainly under-appreciated and the identity tended to be understood as a casual relationship rather
than an identity. In the equation, “M’” is the total stock of outside money, i.e. the monetary aggregate
that reflects liquidity injections by the central bank: in modern times, currency and reserves. “V” is the
velocity with which money circulates, “P” is a price index, and “Y” is a measure of real economic
activity. See Lucas, R. E., Jr. (1980),”Two illustrations of the quantity theory of money”, American
Economic Review, 70(5), 1005-1014; and Sargent, T. J., and Surico, P. (2011), “Two illustrations of the

The Deutsche Bundesbank continued to announce a target for the growth rate of its broad monetary
aggregate M3 until the end of 1998, when the responsibility for monetary policy passed to the ECB.
Other European central banks, including the Banque de France, the Banca d’ltalia, and the Banco de
Espafia, also announced monetary targets or reference ranges complementing other aspects of their
monetary policy strategies, such as exchange rate targets and/or direct inflation targets. See Gerlach,

Other central banks had followed the same paradigm shift in parallel to the adoption of explicit inflation
targets, like the Bank of England and the central banks of New Zealand and Canada in the early 1990s.

This is in line with the results set out in Deutsche Bundesbank (2023), “From the monetary pillar to the

Following monetary policy tightening, the transmission of monetary policy is found to be stronger for
banks that are (i) poorly capitalised (e.g. Van den Heuvel, S. (2002), “Does bank capital matter for

small (e.g. Kashyap, A. and Stein, J. (1995), “The Impact of Monetary Policy on Bank Balance Sheets”,

The PEPP was designed to ensure that the monetary policy stance of the ECB was transmitted
effectively across the euro area, especially in a situation where financial markets were experiencing
significant stress. In particular, the PEPP was designed to allow for fluctuations in the volume of
purchases across time, asset classes and jurisdictions. This flexibility was key in addressing the
specific transmission challenges posed by the pandemic, ensuring that the ECB’s monetary policy
stance was felt uniformly across the euro area economy.

This enhanced support led to a substantial take-up in TLTRO III operations, with banks borrowing a

TLTRO III consists of ten operations with a maturity of three years, starting in September 2019 at
quarterly frequency. When initially launched, the first seven TLTRO III operations could be voluntarily
repaid after two years from the settlement of each operation. In March 2020 the early repayment option
was adjusted to give counterparties the possibility to voluntarily repay funds already one year after
settlement, starting in September 2021. Three more operations were introduced in December 2020,
with an early repayment option at quarterly frequency starting in June 2022. On 27 October 2022 the
ECB’s Governing Council announced a recalibration of all existing TLTRO III operations to ensure
consistency with broader monetary policy normalisation process. From 23 November 2022 interest
rates on all remaining TLTRO III operations were indexed to average applicable key ECB interest rates
from that date onward, in practice increasing their price. Modifications were accompanied by three
additional voluntary early repayment dates introduced for banks wishing to terminate or reduce
borrowings before maturity. In response to the change in pricing conditions, large voluntary repayments
were done in November and December 2022. Currently, only two operations are still outstanding for a
total amount of €76.4 billion and they will be repaid in September and December 2024.

When the interest rate paid on reserves was negative, this substitution effect constituted a “hot potato”
mechanism by which individual banks sought to shed reserves by increasing lending or bond
purchases. See E. Ryan and K. Whelan (2021), “Quantitative Easing and the Hot Potato Effect:
Evidence from euro area banks,” Journal of International Money and Finance 115, 102354.

Arisk surrounding QT that has recently been emphasised is the possibility that the reserve balances
created in QE times might have been hypothecated by banks writing off-balance-sheet claims on them,
thus making the system vulnerable to a sustained loss of liquidity under QT. See recent work by
Acharya, V.V. and Rajan, R. (2022), “Liquidity, liquidity everywhere, not a drop to use—Why flooding

(2023), “Liquidity dependence and the waxing and waning _of central bank balance sheets”, NBER
Working Paper Series, No 31050, National Bureau of Economic Research. According to these studies,
this phenomenon might explain the money market tensions observed in September 2019, as the
amount of fed funds — being withdrawn from the system by the Federal Reserve in the context of its first
phase of QT— dropped to a minimum threshold at which scarcity produced a generalised seizing up of
transactions and a surge in money market interest rates.

This study does not examine the impact of reserves created by longer-term refinancing operations


(such as the TLTRO programmes), which might be viewed as an intermediate case between the polar
cases of liquidity created by asset purchase and liquidity created by short-term refinancing operations.
