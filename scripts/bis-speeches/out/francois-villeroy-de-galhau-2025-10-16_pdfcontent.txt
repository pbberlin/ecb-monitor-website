“Fintechs and sovereignty: Three
pillars to be strengthened together”

I am delighted to welcome you today to the Banque de France for this
sixth edition of the Fintech Forum, organised jointly by the ACPR and the
AMF, whose chair, Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, I wish to warmly welcome.
In a context that is volatile to say the least, the ACPR remains attentive
to the ecosystem, which is the very purpose of this Forum. Let me stress
once again that fintechs require from us just as much attention, dialogue
and consideration as other traditional players. These are also the
commitments of our Fintech Charter that are regularly reviewed: our
response rate to initial contacts within two weeks, as stipulated in the
Charter, remains consistently high at 98%. Once the authorisation
process has begun, response times are 10 days (compared to 9.5 days
last year). In early October, the ACPR also set up a Directorate for
Innovation, Data and Technological Risks, bringing together the divisions
responsible for innovation and those responsible for AI and cyber
supervision, thereby effectively combining innovation and regulation.
This Forum provides an opportunity for regulatory dialogue with the
ecosystem. But it also strives to be strategic: this year's theme is
sovereignty. I would like to share our conviction that the development of
the fintech ecosystem can, and must, strengthen our sovereignty
through three pillars: financing the economy (I), money (II), and lastly
new technologies (III).
I. Sovereignty and the financing of
the economy
1. The financing of the economy requires
“stimulus” from fintechs
I will begin with the first “pillar of sovereignty”: the financing of the
economy. Today, implementing a genuine Savings and Investments
Union (SIU) is an essential step towards establishing European economic
and financial sovereignty. Europe does not lack savings or credit, it lacks
equity. And Europe does not lack total investment, but rather innovative
investment: there is obviously a strong link between these two
observations. 

L'Europe ne manque pas d'épargne, ni de crédit, mais de fonds propres
It is vital to strengthen support for innovation in key areas of sovereignty,
such as digital technology and artificial intelligence (AI), decarbonised
energy, and defence, by mobilising more European financial savings. The
fintech ecosystem, at the forefront of innovation, can play a role in
making our economies more ‘sovereign’ in terms of financing, for
example by fostering new financing channels amid the tokenisation of
finance .  The European pilot regime  supports this process by offering
market infrastructures the opportunity to use blockchain technology
within a simplified framework.
2. Despite their dynamism, fintechs still lack
equity capital
The fintech ecosystem in France is reaching a first stage of maturity,
with over 1,000 fintechs, 50,000 employees, and a number of major
players. It has proved its resilience: despite a sharp decline in fundraising
in 2023 and 2024, the ecosystem has consolidated and held its ground.
This tightening of financing conditions has led fintechs to double down
on their efforts in order to achieve profitability.

Fundraising rebounded in the first half of 2025, with an increase of more
than 20% compared to mid-2024, initially driven by a few large
transactions, often backed by non-European investors. This trend,
however, remains fragile. Today, the ecosystem needs more equity,
particularly from European investors. 
Une priorité donc pour l'UEI : augmenter les fonds propres et le capital-risque
I advocate   an agenda focused on five concrete priorities in terms of
equity and venture capital:
a) a genuine European supervisory framework for investment funds in
order to hasten the transition from national to “pan-European” funds. 
b) the creation of an optional “28th regime" comprising a common EU-
wide set of business law rules, with the aim of reducing administrative
costs for companies operating in several EU countries. The
Commission's consultation on the subject is a promising step forward. 
c) the gradual development of European retirement savings and pension
funds.
 d) the implementation of ambitious public-private partnerships. By
extending the EIB's experience and its European Tech Champions
Initiative (ETCI), we should leverage the influence of private investors in
the venture capital market through public funds.
e) the introduction of European retail investment products through
simplification and standardisation.

II. Sovereignty and money
1. Maintaining the pivotal role of central bank
money
The second "pillar of sovereignty" is monetary. The rapid and potentially
massive growth of stablecoins, most often backed by the US dollar and
strongly supported by the new US administration, could undermine our
monetary sovereignty acquired through the euro. In particular, it could
lead to the disorderly proliferation of private settlement solutions and a
growing dependence on non-European and unregulated players.   How
should we respond? First, by completing the European regulatory
framework – the MiCA Regulation.   This framework would benefit from
the much stricter regulation of the multi-issuance of the same stablecoin
within and outside the European Union, to reduce arbitrage risks in times
of stress. I also advocate, along with the Chair of the AMF, for the
European supervision of crypto-asset issuers, exercised by ESMA.
Furthermore, maintaining the pivotal role of central bank money. This
requires the Eurosystem to offer a wholesale digital euro for the
interbank market and a retail digital euro for the general public. The first
project is less well known and less high-profile than the second, but it is
even more important. The Eurosystem and the Banque de France are
actively working on this as part of the Pontes project: by next year, a
pilot solution will enable financial intermediaries to settle their tokenised
assets in central bank money, either through TARGET services or via a
distributed ledger of the Eurosystem.   In the second stage, the
Eurosystem intends to propose, as part of the Appia project, a shared
ledger   where tokenised central bank money, tokenised bank deposits
and tokenised assets could be exchanged on the same platform. This will
help overcome many technical obstacles to the integration of European
capital markets. This ‘wholesale’ digital currency has therefore become a
high priority: we must accelerate our efforts, and the Banque de France
will do everything in its power to contribute to this acceleration.

2. Promoting the private supply of tokenised
money
While the provision of a CBDC is essential, it is not intended to cover all
uses in the tokenised economy. In addition, it is necessary to have
tokenised commercial bank money, equivalent to traditional commercial
bank money in our monetary system. Why shouldn't European banks
consider the USD-backed stablecoin market, since that is where the
market is today? But they should be just as focused on their natural
market of tomorrow: EUR-backed stablecoins. In that regard, I welcome
the launch of a first consortium of nine European banks, following the
first initiative of a French bank. The technical choice remains open
between tokenised deposits  or EUR-backed stablecoins issued by
banks: we could have both, but we must not end up with neither. The
cooperation of all market players, particularly French fintechs, is
therefore necessary and urgent in order to develop these innovative use
cases.
III. Sovereignty and technology
1. Mastering new technologies
I will conclude with a third pillar in which fintechs are often pioneers: new
technologies. Fintechs offer immense opportunities for the financial
sector, both in terms of improving internal efficiency and customer
services. However, they create a number of vulnerabilities; I will take the
example of AI and quantum computing. The development of AI is a
decisive boost for productivity, but it may also contribute to the
amplification of financial vulnerabilities. For instance, market
concentration in AI, in terms of specialised hardware, cloud services  or
pre-trained foundation models, could increase the risk of dependence on
third parties. Similarly, while quantum computing offers new capabilities
in terms of computing and metrics, it also poses major risks in terms of
data confidentiality and security for all financial players.

Regulation can help to support the adoption of these new technologies
within a secure framework.   The European AI Act   applies to the
financial sector, and in particular to "high-risk" AI systems. It will take full
effect from August 2026. I welcome the fact that the ACPR has been
designated as the market supervisory authority for high-risk use cases in
the financial sector in the draft organisation recently presented by the
French Ministry of Finance. Fortunately, a significant part of the
requirements set out in the AI Act are already included in sector-specific
regulations. We are actively preparing for this role and intend to continue
to involve market participants through regular meetings with the
industry. The ACPR will take particular care to minimise the regulatory
burden on institutions by adopting a risk-based approach and exploiting
all possible synergies with its "usual" supervisory tasks. 
Central banks can also set an example by developing their technological
expertise. As regards quantum computing, the Banque de France, one of
the pioneers in this field, is conducting experiments in collaboration with
several other central banks and financial institutions. At the same time,
we encourage all financial institutions to commit to the post-quantum
transition without delay; we will play our role in monitoring this transition,
but also in influencing it as co-chair [with Canada] of the G7 working
group on quantum technologies.
2. Strengthening our collective resilience
In an environment marked by cyber risk; the European DORA
Regulation  has applied to all financial entities since January 2025; it
introduces very concrete measures: institutions must now regularly test
the security of their information systems and report major incidents. As
regards cloud services specifically, let me point out that, even though
critical IT service providers are subject to supervision, financial
institutions, including fintechs, remain responsible for their own risks.
They therefore need to remain in control of the entire subcontracting
chain, and regularly audit their IT service providers. These audit tasks
can be shared between institutions, as is the case in the German
banking sector: strength lies in unity.

I will conclude with the words of Jean Monnet: “Sovereignty withers
when it is frozen in the forms of the past.” Conversely, fintechs, the
spearheads of innovation in the financial sector, have the power to
promote financial, monetary and technological sovereignty. Rest assured
that the ACPR is committed to supporting you during this period of rapid
transformation in the financial sector, so that innovation continues to go
hand in hand with stability. Thank you for your attention.

Tokenisation involves issuing, recording and exchanging assets in the
form of digital tokens on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) platforms.
EU Regulation of 30 May 2022 setting up a pilot regime for market
infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology. It enables
existing or new market infrastructures to use DLT in a simplified
framework for trading or settlement activities involving "tokenised"
financial instruments. It aims to promote innovation and experimentation
within a framework that ensures investor protection, market integrity and
financial stability.
