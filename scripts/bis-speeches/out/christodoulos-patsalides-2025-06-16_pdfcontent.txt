Introduction – The Imperative of Resilience 
Ladies and gentlemen,
It is a pleasure to join you today at the fourth ICPAC Mediterranean Finance Summit. I 
would like to thank the organizers for convening such a distinguished group of 
professionals and corporate leaders who are instrumental in shaping the financial future 
of our region.
We meet at a time when resilience is no longer an abstract goal but a daily necessity. 
The global environment remains deeply uncertain - shaped by geopolitical tensions, 
trade disputes, economic fragmentation, rapid technological change, and the 
accelerating impacts of climate change. Advances in digital technology, automation, 
artificial intelligence, and new financial innovations are transforming industries, 
challenging existing business models, and creating new vulnerabilities - from cyber 
risks to regulatory gaps. These powerful forces are testing the flexibility of our 
institutions, the responsiveness of our policies, and the strength of collaboration 
between central banks, regulatory authorities, financial supervisors and fiscal 
institutions, both at the national and European levels.
In this context, I would like to share how we, as policymakers and supervisors, are 
working to reinforce financial resilience - not just to manage current shocks, but to lay 
the groundwork for sustainable and inclusive growth.
To frame today's discussion, I will focus on three key dimensions:
First, the evolving economic and monetary policy outlook in Europe - including 
recent decisions by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank and their 
implications for stability and growth.
Second, the strategic reforms needed to complete Europe's financial architecture 
- from capital market integration to a more unified regulatory and supervisory 
framework.
And third, the growing importance of regulation and operational resilience in 
building trust, protecting stability, and enabling innovation in an increasingly digital 
and interconnected financial system.
I will also briefly reflect on Cyprus's experience - both the progress we have made and 
the steps we are taking to future-proof our financial sector.

2/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Through these reflections, I intend to provide a forward-looking perspective - not only 
on where we stand today, but also on the path we must take to navigate uncertainty 
with confidence and purpose.
Let me begin with a brief overview of the broader European economic landscape.
Europe's Economic Landscape: Navigating Trade Tensions & 
Monetary Policy
In April 2025, at the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, we decided to 
further lower the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, based on our most recent 
assessment of inflation dynamics, underlying inflation pressures, and the strength of 
monetary policy transmission. The disinflation process has continued to progress well, 
strengthening confidence that inflation will sustainably return to the 2% target in the 
medium-term horizon.
At the same time, it is important to underline that under the exceptionally uncertain 
economic conditions, monetary policy decisions are calibrated with extra caution 
without any pre-commitment to a predetermined path, adhering to a data-dependent 
meeting-by-meeting approach, which has served very well in ensuring full optionality 
and agility in our policy responses. 
The broader euro area outlook remains fragile. Real GDP growth reached 0.9% in 
2024, and while the labour market continues to show resilience - with unemployment 
remaining at a historic low of 6.2% in March 2025 - risks remain elevated. Trade 
disputes, geopolitical instability, and other factors that - ceteris paribus- contribute to 
tighter financial conditions continue to weigh on confidence and investment across the 
euro area.
Nonetheless, the inflation outlook provides grounds for cautious optimism. Inflation 
stood at 2.2% in April 2025, with underlying measures pointing towards sustained 
convergence with the ECB's target. Lower energy prices and a tempering of wage 
growth pressures have all contributed to this positive development. However, the April's 
reading upticks in services and core inflation, although likely due to stronger than 
expected Easter effects, warrant continuous close monitoring. 
While price stability is in near sight, the road ahead is not without challenges. Risks 
associated with global supply chain disruptions, inflationary, stagnant and even 
stagflationary dynamics, are still present. For the corporate sector, this evolving 
economic landscape presents both opportunities and challenges. The gradual easing of 
interest rates is improving financing conditions, and stable prices boost confidence and 
support household consumption and firms' investment plans. But firms must remain 
vigilant to the broader risks emanating from global fragmentation and shifting 
investment patterns and stand ready to adapt and respond effectively.
Challenges for Europe and the way forward: Completing Europe's 
Financial Architecture/Strategic Priorities 
While monetary policy plays a vital role in maintaining macroeconomic stability, it 
cannot, on its own, resolve the deeper structural inefficiencies that continue to hold 

3/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
back Europe's economic dynamism. To build a financial ecosystem that is not only 
resilient in the face of crisis but also conducive to long-term prosperity, we must 
complete the long-standing project of deepening Europe's financial architecture.
First, we must address the persistent fragmentation of the Single Market. Although it 
has been a cornerstone of European integration for over three decades, the Single 
Market still suffers from uneven implementation and regulatory inconsistencies, 
particularly in services, digital activity, and professional mobility. These barriers 
significantly impede growth, limit scale economies, and reduce cross-border 
competition. In response, the European Commission's upcoming Single Market 
Strategy 2025  is set to provide a refreshed policy framework to eliminate remaining 1
bottlenecks. It includes proposals for harmonized corporate rules, streamlined 
procedures for cross-border activity, and improved enforcement mechanisms - all 
aimed at making the internal market truly function as a single economic space.
Second, the underdevelopment of capital markets in the EU remains a key constraint 
on investment and innovation. Despite a substantial pool of private savings - estimated 
at around €33 trillion  - Europe continues to lag behind other major economies in 2
converting those savings into productive investment. Fragmented regulatory regimes, 
insufficient market depth, and relatively low cross-border participation hinder access to 
finance, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. The Capital Markets Union 
(CMU)   aims to tackle these shortcomings by creating a truly integrated and efficient 3
market for capital. A fully realized CMU will allow investors and savers to diversify more 
broadly and enable businesses - especially startups and scale-ups - to access deeper 
pools of equity and debt financing across the Union at lower costs.
Third, to support innovation and technological advancement, it is essential to scale up 
Europe's venture capital ecosystem. While Europe has made progress in fostering 
startups, the continent continues to lag behind its global peers - particularly the United 
States - in terms of risk capital availability and the ability of startups to grow into globally 
competitive firms. Early-stage and growth-stage companies frequently face funding 
gaps that limit their ability to scale, commercialize new technologies, and create high-
quality jobs. A stronger, more integrated European venture capital market would help 
address these issues. The European Commission's venture capital policy  outlines a 4
range of initiatives to attract more private investment, reduce regulatory fragmentation, 
and enhance access to equity finance across borders. These include reforms to 
improve exit conditions through deeper capital markets, support for cross-border 
venture funds, and initiatives like InvestEU, which crowd in private capital by sharing 5 
risk. Building such an ecosystem is vital not only for economic competitiveness but also 
for achieving Europe's strategic autonomy in key technologies.
Fourth, Europe must ensure effective and coherent financial supervision across its 
internal borders. Today, the supervision of capital markets and financial services 
remains largely national, resulting in regulatory fragmentation and inconsistent 
enforcement. To strengthen market integrity and investor confidence, it is essential to 
upgrade the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). A 6 
more empowered ESMA - ideally with authority akin to the Single Supervisory 

4/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Mechanism (SSM) in the banking sector - would enable more consistent application of 
EU law, reduce compliance complexity for cross-border operators, and reinforce the 
EU's global standing as a safe and efficient capital market.
Fifth, the Banking Unionremains unfinished without the introduction of a fully 7 
mutualised Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS). The absence of a common DGS 
perpetuates the so-called "bank-sovereign nexus," whereby concerns about a country's 
fiscal health can spill over into confidence in its banks. Completing this pillar would help 
ensure that depositors are protected uniformly across the euro area, reinforce financial 
stability, and prevent fragmentation in times of stress. It would also further level the 
playing field across member states, making the European banking sector more robust 
and competitive.
Finally, the creation of a safe European asset, such as a Eurobond, is critical to 8 
strengthening the transmission of monetary policy and providing a benchmark 
instrument for EU-wide capital allocation. A safe asset would serve as a low-risk 
investment vehicle for institutional investors, enhance the stability of the European 
financial system, and support the international role of the euro. It would also contribute 
to breaking the negative feedback loop between national sovereign debt markets and 
financial institutions, fostering greater financial integration and resilience across the 
euro area.
Taken together, these priorities form the pillars of a more complete, competitive, and 
crisis-resilient European financial framework. Achieving them will not be easy - but the 
cost of inaction is higher. Without decisive progress, Europe risks falling behind in the 
global race for investment, innovation, and financial leadership.
Regulation and Operational Resilience 
Building on the structural reforms I just outlined, it is equally important to ensure that the 
European financial system is not only better integrated, but also well protected and 
prepared to withstand new types of shocks in a rapidly evolving corporate and risk 
environment. To this end, European authorities remain firmly committed to safeguarding 
and strengthening financial system resilience and this commitment is reflected in the 
ongoing completion of the Basel III framework, which emerged in response to the 9 
2008 global financial crisis. The finalisation of these reforms ensures that banks remain 
adequately capitalised, better manage liquidity risks, and are less vulnerable to future 
shocks.
In parallel, EU authorities are also prioritising the implementation of new regulatory 
frameworks that respond to emerging structural challenges. The Digital Operational 
Resilience Act (DORA)  introduces a harmonised EU framework to enhance the 10
digital resilience of financial institutions against ICT-related disruptions and cyber 
threats. On the sustainability front, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD) and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)  are being 11  12
rolled out to improve transparency, accountability, and the integration of Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations into both corporate practices and 
investment decisions.

5/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Together, these reforms reflect a forward-looking regulatory agenda aimed at future-
proofing the financial system-ensuring stability, improving risk management, and 
aligning financial sector operations with broader societal and environmental goals.
Cyprus: Strengthening Resilience in Practice 
Let me now turn to Cyprus - a small but open economy that has shown notable strength 
and adaptability in recent years.
Despite a persistently volatile international backdrop, the Cypriot economy has 
continued to deliver solid results. In 2024, Cyprus recorded one of the highest growth 
rates in the euro area, supported by resilient private consumption, growing investment 
in housing and infrastructure, and an exceptionally strong tourism season. Services 
exports - including ICT, shipping, trade, and professional and financial services - 
continued to diversify and reinforce the country's economic base. These developments 
reflect a deeper structural transformation, which has made the Cypriot economy more 
agile and better able to absorb external shocks.
The labour market remains strong, with unemployment declining near full employment 
levels, and inflation has moderated considerably - reflecting both the easing of supply-
side shocks and the effectiveness of euro area monetary policy. This disinflation 
process is helping to restore purchasing power and support business and consumer 
confidence.
Fiscal indicators have also improved substantially. Cyprus has achieved a significant 
reduction in public debt in recent years, far outpacing the euro area average. The 
country's performance has been positively recognized by all major credit rating 
agencies, which now place Cyprus firmly in the 'A' category. The IMF, in its latest Article 
IV report, also acknowledged the economy's resilience and the effectiveness of national 
policies in managing both risk and opportunity.
Looking ahead, growth is projected to remain steady. At the same time, however, global 
uncertainties - particularly those linked to rising trade tensions and geopolitical 
fragmentation - present clear downside risks. While Cyprus has limited direct exposure 
to global goods trade disruptions, we remain highly interconnected through services 
and financial channels and must therefore stay alert to second-round effects.
Turning to the banking sector, the progress achieved over recent years is substantial. 
Banks today are better capitalized, more profitable, and more efficient. Core indicators - 
including capital adequacy, liquidity, and return on equity - are well above the EU 
average. This provides a strong buffer against volatility and supports financial stability 
under a range of scenarios.
Importantly, credit quality has continued to improve, with non-performing loans steadily 
declining. While still elevated compared to EU norms, the trend is encouraging and 
reflects the sector's ongoing efforts to address legacy risks. It is vital that this progress 
continues, with particular attention paid to less significant institutions and to maintaining 
strong risk management practices across the board.

6/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
In parallel, the Central Bank of Cyprus has continued to strengthen its supervisory 
approach. Our focus is not merely reactive - it is forward-looking. This means 
anticipating and preparing for emerging risks - from cyber threats and climate-related 
exposures to the integration of artificial intelligence and the growing presence of non-
bank financial players.
In this context, we have introduced targeted enhancements to our supervisory 
frameworks. A key area of focus has been the growing sector of electronic money 
institutions (EMIs) and payment service providers (PIs), which are playing an 
increasingly important role in the evolving financial system. In December 2024, we 
announced the establishment of a comprehensive licensing and supervisory strategy for 
EMIs and PIs. As part of our organizational restructuring, a dedicated Directorate was 
created to oversee these institutions, enabling more specialized and effective 
supervision. The regulatory perimeter must evolve in tandem with the market - ensuring 
stability without stifling innovation. As a result of these efforts, the sector has grown 
substantially, with 39 institutions now operating under our supervision - a reflection of 
both the market's dynamism and the credibility of our regulatory environment.
Other key supervisory enhancements include the adoption of more risk-sensitive 
supervisory methodologies and the integration of climate considerations into 
institutional strategy and governance. We have also raised the counter-cyclical capital 
buffer to reinforce resilience against rising systemic risks - a measure that reflects our 
commitment to proactive macroprudential policy. In parallel, we are streamlining 
regulatory requirements where appropriate. On 2 May 2025, the Central Bank of Cyprus 
published the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Directive of 
2025. The Directive aims to strengthen the framework for the prevention of money 
laundering and terrorist financing by aligning procedures with the Guidelines of the 
European Banking Authority and international best practices. It also facilitates the 
provision of financial services by introducing simpler procedures.
As part of our sustainability agenda, the Central Bank has established a Sustainability 
Committee at Board level, a dedicated Sustainability Team, and an independent Office 
of Climate Change. These structures support our broader effort to align supervisory 
expectations with evolving EU standards, and to ensure that supervised institutions take 
meaningful steps to manage climate-related financial risks.
Moreover, we continue to advocate for digital preparedness in the banking sector. 
Cybersecurity, digital transformation, and operational resilience are now at the core of 
prudential discussions - not merely auxiliary concerns. The safe adoption of 
technological innovation must go hand-in-hand with robust governance, risk 
management, and appropriate regulatory oversight.
In sum, Cyprus's resilience is not the result of chance. It is the product of deliberate 
reform, prudent policy, and close public-private cooperation. But as always, there is no 
room for complacency. The global environment is becoming more complex - and more 
interconnected. The challenge before us is to ensure that our financial sector remains 
not only sound and stable, but also innovative, responsive, and prepared for the future.
Closing Reflections: Leadership Through Uncertainty 

7/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
As we reflect on the path ahead, one message is clear: the global economic 
environment will remain uncertain and fast-changing for the foreseeable future. In this 
context, the role of financial leaders - especially CFOs and senior executives - is more 
critical than ever.
Leadership today requires more than financial acumen. It demands agility, foresight, 
and a commitment to ethical governance. It means preparing institutions not only to 
withstand volatility, but to adapt early and strategically to emerging risks - whether 
geopolitical, technological, or environmental. 
In this broader effort, smaller economies can lead by example - demonstrating how 
agility and strategic foresight can turn challenges into opportunities for the entire Union.
Small countries, such as ours, often have the potential to act more nimbly than big 
ones. In this sense, they can be "incubators" of new ideas or new business models 
within the EU that challenge the rigidities of some of the bigger countries. It's an 
example of healthy system competition from which the whole EU can in principle 
benefit. But that won't happen in practice unless developments in small countries can 
scale up to the European level fast and without internal barriers. And that's where the 
Single Market comes in. 
At the Central Bank of Cyprus, we remain committed to supporting the above effort with 
our contribution to a financial ecosystem that is resilient, forward-looking, and grounded 
in trust. Through sound monetary policy, effective supervision, and proactive regulatory 
engagement, we will continue working closely with all stakeholders - in Cyprus and 
across Europe - to promote financial stability, foster innovation and build the 
foundations for long-term prosperity.
Let me close by thanking ICPAC once again for the invitation, and for the important role 
it plays in advancing dialogue and collaboration within the financial community. It is only 
through shared understanding and collective effort that we can meet the challenges of 
today - and shape the opportunities of tomorrow.
Thank you.
