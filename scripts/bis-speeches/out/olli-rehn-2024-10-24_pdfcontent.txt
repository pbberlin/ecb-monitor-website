1/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Olli Rehn: Europe in search of growth and productivity in the shadow 
of geopolitics
Speech by Mr Olli Rehn, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the Peterson Institute for 
International Economics, Washington DC, 22 October 2024.

 accompanying the speech Presentation
Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,
Let me begin by thanking the Peterson Institute for inviting me to speak at this year's 
Macro Week. It is a great honor to share my views with such a distinguished audience.
I have followed the Institute since nearly its inception, as Fred Bergsten's book was part 
of our coursework when I was studying economics and international relations in 
Minnesota. That was in the fall of 1982, a remarkable time in U.S. economic and 
monetary history, as Paul Volcker's disinflationary measures were simultaneously 
reducing both inflation and employment-a reality felt on the streets of St. Paul and 
Minneapolis.
I must admit, Volcker was not especially popular among us students at the liberal-
leaning Macalester College, though he was certainly respected for his consistency and 
persistence, at least among the economics majors. In hindsight, his actions had historic 
significance, not just for monetary policy, but also for great-power relations-they helped 
restore the economic foundations of U.S. global strategic influence.
As for me, I could say-if it didn't show a serious lack of self-irony-that this was a 
formative experience for a future central banker, though at the time, I had no inkling that 
I would one day enter this field. In every central banker, there is a little Paul Volcker. – I 
shall return to the lessons of Volcker's disinflation later, in the context of Europe's 
recent experiences.
Slide 2. Roadmap of today's talk
You can see the roadmap of today's talk on this slide. I will first of present my thoughts 
on the ongoing strategy review of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is due for 
completion in 2025. Second, I will focus on the implications of the recent rise in both 
geopolitical and geoeconomic fragmentation. Third and finally, I will discuss what in my 
view is the Achilles heel of Europe: weak productivity growth.
Slide 3. Three periods of euro area inflation
To provide context for the ongoing ECB strategy review, let's take a look at the history 
of inflation in the euro area over the last quarter of century, dividing it into three distinct 
periods.

2/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
First, during the final years of the Great Moderation from 1999 to 2009, inflation 
averaged around 2%. Then, in the post-financial crisis period until 2021, inflation was 
exceptionally low, averaging just above 1%. After 2021, as we know, inflation surged 
and has averaged over 5%. Each of these periods has been characterized by different 
drivers of inflation (or deflation!).
When we at the ECB Governing Council last reviewed our monetary policy strategy, in 
July 2021, we had witnessed nearly a decade of low inflation. But we were actually on 
the brink of a period of dramatically accelerating inflation. The Federal Reserve faced a 
similar situation, as the Federal Open Market Committee reviewed their monetary policy 
strategy in August 2020. The Fed then adopted flexible average inflation targeting, 
designed to address persistently low inflation.
Slide 4. The perceived de facto ceiling under the old target pushes inflation 
expectations clearly below 2%
Before the ECB's 2021 review, the price stability definition ('below but close to 2%') was 
perceived assymmetric, as seen in this graph. a
This perception is supported by several studies by the Bank of Finland and ECB staff. 
The asymmetry set a virtual 2% ceiling for inflation, thus lowering the de facto inflation 
target and leading to asymmetric policy responses and preferences.1
Slide 5. The ECB's current monetary policy strategy: a symmetric 2% inflation 
target over the medium term
Hence, by far the most consequential decision in the ECB's 2021 strategy review was 
to establish a symmetric inflation target of 2% over the medium term. The symmetry 
implies that both negative and positive deviations from the target are equally 
undesirable. Another key element of the strategy is the medium-term orientation for 
reaching the target.
Empirical evidence shows that the ECB's revised symmetric inflation target has been 
effective in anchoring long-term inflation expectations firmly to the 2% inflation target, 
despite the turbulence of recent years.
In the 2021 strategy review, most of our work focused quite naturally on improving our 
policymaking in a ' ' environment. Now, over three years and three crises later, lowflation
we are re-assessing how well the revised strategy has performed in a high inflation 
environment. Most importantly, we need to consider how to further develop our strategy 
in the light of an emerging new – or perhaps old or recycled – normal.
Slide 6. Inflation is stabilizing to our symmetric 2% target – which has served us 
well
Right after its introduction in 2021, the ECB's new monetary policy strategy was put to 
the test in an environment it was not specifically designed for: a series of supply shocks 
and rapidly accelerating inflation.

3/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The supply shocks were caused first by the COVID-19 pandemic and then by Russia's 
unjustified and brutal war in Ukraine that led to a sharp increase in energy prices. 
These supply factors contributed to the surge of inflation to a peak of 10.6% in October 
2022. Inflation averaged 8.4% in 2022 and 5.5% in 2023, as measured by the 
Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), shown on the left-hand graph. We've 
come a long way from there: in September 2024, HICP inflation stood at 1.7%.
Besides driving the already high inflation rate, the energy crisis caused a rocketing rise 
in the energy import bill for Europeans, increasing it by around 400 billion euros, equal 
to 3%–4% of GDP. Stagflation, i.e. the combination of stagnation and high inflation, 
became a serious threat scenario, presenting a major dilemma for monetary policy.
After a period of deliberation in 2022 from March until June, the ECB began raising 
interest rates. We discontinued quantitative easing (QE) and increased policy rates 
rapidly by a total of 450 basis points between July 2022 and September 2023, bringing 
the deposit rate, our main policy rate, from -0.5% to 4%. In line with our revised 
strategy, we intended to tame inflation over the medium term by preventing high 
inflation from leading to elevated inflation expectations and potentially to a wage-price 
spiral. In my view, this goal has largely been achieved.
Some argue that we should have acted sooner. I can say that many of us policymakers 
were indeed ready to raise rates earlier due to soaring inflation. However, Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 reintroduced the era of brutal geopolitics and 
created a massive cloud of stagflationary uncertainty over Europe's economy. While the 
ramifications were felt globally, and still are, the impact was more severe for Europe 
than, for example, the United States. This is something to keep in mind in all post-
mortems of the recent poly-crisis years.
Looking at the latest policy decisions, progress in lowering inflation has enabled us to 
make three 25 basis-point cuts to interest rates since June 2024. The most recent cut 
was unanimously decided last Thursday, as we now have greater confidence that 
inflation is converging towards 2% on a sustained basis. Disinflation in the euro area is 
well on track.
All in all, a soft landing seems plausible in the euro area. However, growth is expected 
to remain sluggish, as shown in the right-hand graph. The growth outlook has 
weakened quite clearly in the past few months, which could also increase disinflationary 
pressures.
Based on the current outlook, and as our rates still are at the restrictive territory, the 
direction of rate changes is clear. The speed and scope of rate cuts will depend on our 
overall assessment of the trend in three variables: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of 
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
Slide 7. Reflections on the ECB's next strategy review in 2025
Based on the experience of recent years, the symmetric, medium-term 2% inflation 
target has served us well. It has provided a clear anchor and enough pre-calibrated and 
meaningful flexibility in terms of both the timing and instruments of policy. We have not 
had to take the drastically contractionary policy actions that the old target might have 

4/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
implied. And we didn't need to show Volckerian stubbornness, with all respect to him, 
thanks to the fact that inflation expectations remained well-anchored.
Thus, in my view, the inflation target itself does not need to be revisited now. As the 
saying goes, don't fix it if it ain't broke. However, we do need a deeper understanding of 
inflation dynamics and the secular trends that are transforming the operational 
environment of monetary policy, such as geopolitical fragmentation, climate change, 
labor market transition and other structural drivers of the natural rate of interest.
Geopolitical tensions have risen substantially with Russia's illegal war in Ukraine, the 
tragic war in the Middle East, and China's strategic aims, both technological and 
military. Trade wars, protectionism and geoeconomic fragmentation are the byproducts 
of these tensions, and so are the diversion and relocation of global value chains.
Key questions for central bankers are, how significant are these developments, and do 
they have implications for the level of the long-term real natural rate of interest, or the 
equilibrium interest rate, r*?
To answer these questions, it is useful to look at whether production is being reshored 
or transferred back home at substantial levels. In other words, is globalization indeed 
reversing?
Slide 8. Geopolitics is shaping the operating environment – along with other 
secular trends
Yes, we are witnessing signs of trade fragmentation. Given the steep rise in trade 
barriers and protectionism, the ramifications to the world economy, not least the 
EMDEs, should not be underestimated.  But so far, no fully-fledged reversal of 
economic globalization has taken place.
What we are mostly seeing is the lengthening of global value chains. Even if direct 
between China and the West is in modest decline,trade   Chinese value-added 
imported by the U.S. and EU have not diminished – our BOFIT staff analysis indicates 
that, in between 2018 and 2023, Chinese value added remained stable in US 
manufacturing imports and slightly increased in Europe – as shown in the left-hand 
graph. It seems that value chains have simply been rerouted via connector countries, 
such as Mexico and Vietnam.
Smaller countries like Finland and the other Nordics have greatly benefited from 
deepening economic integration. Multilateral trading system has been a win-win and a 
key building block of the strategic community of liberal democracies. Economic 
cooperation with the United States remains crucial for this achievement and alliance, 
even if this fact has not been overly prevalent in the U.S. presidential elections. Trade 
wars would only damage this bond. Suffice it to say that we Europeans are forced to 
pre-emptively prepare for different options.
Thanks to Finland's accession to NATO, our ties with the US and our trade partnership 
has strengthened, also in strategic areas (right-hand graph). Notable cases are cruise 
ships and tech products exported to the US, and on the imports side, the new American 
F-35 fighter jets that will replace soon our cherished but aging F-18 Hornets.

5/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The biggest increase in Finland's trade with the US has come from trade in digital 
products and IT services. In my view, this underlines the substantial mutual benefits of 
this economic partnership.
Slide 9. Estimates of the natural rate of interest in the euro area
The precise implications of geoeconomic fragmentation for inflation, growth and 
productivity, and therefore for monetary policy, warrant careful consideration in our 
ongoing strategy review.
A key question is the level of the long-term real natural rate of interest, r* or the 
equilibrium interest rate. R-star is a most pertinent analytical framework for thinking 
about the economy and monetary policy, even though it is not truly viable as a concrete 
policymaking tool.
Some argue that the natural rate is rising due to significant investment needs for the 
green transition, artificial intelligence and defense spending. Meanwhile, others believe 
it is declining due to weak productivity growth, aging populations and geoeconomic 
fragmentation. The true trajectory of the natural rate remains unclear and requires 
plenty of further and deeper analysis and continuous research.
Estimates of r* for the euro area are currently slightly above zero, or broadly between 0 
and 1, as shown in this graph. At the Bank of Finland, we also regularly examine the 
evolution of natural rate, of course acknowledging the significant uncertainty associated 
with estimating r*. Our researchers currently estimate the euro area natural rate to be in 
the range of 0.2-0.8%, which is in the same ballpark as the estimates in this graph and 
somewhat above that of the New York Fed with its broadly recognized Holston-Laubach-
Williams model.2
Slide 10. Productivity growth is Europe's Achilles heel – we need decisive actions
Let me finally turn to the marked slowdown in productivity growth, which is the real 
Achilles' heel of Europe. This is an issue that is closely linked to the natural rate and 
monetary policy, but also to the longer-term economic success of Europe (and other 
nations for that matter).
Europe's long-lasting productivity gap to the U.S. has widened further in the past few 
years, as shown in the left-hand graph. A key reason for this is the energy shock 
resulting from Russia's war in Ukraine, as it adversely affects competitiveness 
specifically in the euro area – unlike past oil shocks that tended to hit all firms globally. 
The right-hand graph shows that the producer prices for energy rose much more in the 
euro area than in the US, but they have also remained higher.
In Finland, we have adjusted to the loss of Russian energy imports by increasing 
domestic production of renewable and nuclear power. Thus, energy prices did not 
increase so drastically in Finland as in some other countries and have indeed already 
returned to their pre-pandemic level.

6/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
A major reason for Europe's slow productivity growth in recent years is weak 
, driven by the uncertainty from Russia's war in Ukraine and the energy investment
crisis, and possibly tight financial conditions.
As to the determinants of productive investment, the distinction between structural and 
cyclical is never crystal clear – it's rather a line drawn in water. It is true that the current 
clouds of both brutal geopolitics and trans-Atlantic and intra-European uncertainty are 
weighing on the European economy in the form of confidence-damaging effects.
Still, if I may paraphrase a certain giant of economics: "In the long run we are all retired. 
But in the meantime, we need more investment."  
In other words, even though Europe's longer-term growth and competitiveness 
challenges cannot be solved by monetary policy tools, we know that investment is 
driven by many factors, not least by aggregate demand, which is obviously affected by 
financial conditions. Thus, in the shadow of recent supply shocks and current slow 
growth, an easing in financial conditions should help avoiding scarring effects in 
investment that is needed to increase longer-term productivity.3
The need to pursue stronger productivity growth on all fronts is the key message in the 
recent report on EU competitiveness by ex-President of the ECB, Mario Draghi. The 
Draghi report is a clear-eyed and even brutal diagnosis of Europe's weak growth and 
weak competitiveness. It makes important proposals for closing the innovation gap and 
combining climate goals with industrial competitiveness, as well as enhancing security 
by pooling defense capacities in the EU.
Likewise, Draghi calls for cutting the red tape and speeding up structural reforms at 
both national and EU levels. We must support better diffusion of new technologies, 
improve access to finance and remove existing barriers to services across countries. 
Cutting-edge research and innovation, including AI, will play a key role in the pursuit of 
these goals.
Slide 11. Conclusions
Let me conclude. Many crucial issues for Europe are at stake now, and they also matter 
for the United States, Europe's closest ally and partner.
First and foremost is unity and determination in the face of Russia´s imperialist 
aggression. This is an existential issue not only for European security but for the whole 
free world. Our support to Ukraine must remain unwavering, and we must work with all 
our partners to strengthen international security and cooperation.
Second, the rise in geopolitical tensions is contributing to an increasingly uncertain and 
volatile global environment and has significant implications for economic policy in 
Europe–and beyond. The changing geopolitical landscape, along with other long-term 
trends, shapes the new normal that we must consider when we develop our monetary 
policy strategy.

7/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Finally, reinforcing the structural foundations of the European economy – i.e. 
productivity growth and industrial competitiveness – is of paramount importance. While 
we face many challenges, with determined national action and EU-wide cooperation 
Europe can revitalize its productivity growth and lay a solid basis for sustainable growth 
and employment.
A key part of this effort will be fostering mutually beneficial partnerships with like-
minded countries, especially the United States.
Thank you for your attention! I am looking forward to your questions and what will no 
doubt be an interesting discussion.
