« 10 years of the Observatory for
Banking Inclusion: an example of
collective efficiency »

I am delighted to be here with you to celebrate the tenth anniversary of
the Observatoire de l’inclusion bancaire (OIB – Observatory for Banking
Inclusion). It is a great pleasure to welcome the Chairman of the Cour
des comptes (Court of Auditors), Pierre Moscovici, who, as Minister of
Finance, introduced the 2013 Banking Law that led to the creation of the
Observatory.
 
La naissance de l'observatoire de l'inclusion bancaire (OIB) ...
I have played my own modest part in this collective endeavour by
chairing 21 of the 25 meetings of the OIB since September 2014. The
Observatory was born out of a strong conviction – perhaps contrary to
the commonly-held view – that finance and banks can act as a lever for
social inclusion. Let me be clear: the Banque de France, which is often
associated with sovereign missions (money and financial stability), is
also proud to have social missions, which are essential for our Network
and for me as Governor.

In 10 years, the Observatory has made significant progress.
Unfortunately, in France and in Europe – unlike in the United States – we
are quicker to lament our failures than to acknowledge our successes.
So, this morning, it is a pleasure to celebrate a collective source of pride
and, allow me to draw some broader lessons for public policy in our
country at a time fraught with doubt. Effective public policy requires at
least three ingredients: sustained action (I), quantified assessment (II),
and a partnership and regional approach (III). However, we can’t afford to
rest on our laurels, so I will conclude with some forward-looking
comments (IV).  
I. Sustained action and perseverance
The creation of the OIB in 2014 was part of the long history of banking
and financial inclusion in France in two main areas: access to banking
services and the protection of the most vulnerable consumers of
financial services.
... S'insère dans l'histoire de l'inclusion bancaire et financière
Image


From the time that the 1984 Banking Law was introduced by Jacques
Delors – almost 30 years before the equivalent European law – the right
to a basic bank account procedure was created to guarantee access to
banking services for all. The Banque de France implements this
procedure, which allows anyone who has been refused an account by a
bank to be designated an establishment that will provide basic banking
services free of charge. Even though France has one of Europe’s highest
levels of access to banking services at 99.2%, the right to a basic bank
account procedure continues to meet a real need: 29,300 designations
were issued in 2024. I note that this number is steadily decreasing (down
by 57% from the peak of 2015), which attests to a higher rate of access.
Banking inclusion also means protecting the most vulnerable consumers
of financial services. In 1989, the Neiertz Act  introduced a collective
procedure for handling cases of household overindebtedness from an
overall perspective. This procedure was then regularly enhanced – with
considerable cross-party consensus – by the Lagarde Act  in 2010 – on
revolving credit in particular – followed by the Hamon Act   in 2014 on
the search for lasting solutions to limit recurring applications. France now
has Europe’s most advanced system for preventing and dealing with
overindebtedness. 
II. Quantified assessment:
commitments and impact on bank
charges
I have spoken about the long term. Let us now turn to the present and
the significant progress that has been enabled by the OIB in three areas:
figures, commitments and results.
i
ii
iii

First off, figures are essential: the financial vulnerability of households is
detected by credit institutions using mechanisms implemented by the
Observatory. Consequently, 4.3 million people were identified as
financially vulnerable in December 2023 (up by 86% compared to 2015).
This sharp increase does not point to a deterioration, but to a much more
effective identification of vulnerable situations. Moreover, it is a
preliminary step in the implementation of appropriate protective
measures, particularly in terms of bank charges. These figures have
elicited commitments from credit institutions and public authorities.
Several recent examples bear this out. In 2018, banks committed to
providing the vulnerable customer solution more widely and to cap
payment incident fees. In 2020, these commitments were incorporated
into the second version of the Banking inclusion and prevention of
overindebtedness charter, which caps payment incident fees at EUR 20
per month and EUR 200 per year for beneficiaries of the vulnerable
customer solution, and at EUR 25 per month for financially vulnerable
customers. The Decree of 20 July 2020  also made it possible to modify
the criteria for detecting situations of financial vulnerability by allowing
earlier and broader identification of the customers concerned. 
These commitments have produced concrete results. Financially
vulnerable customers are being detected at an increasingly early stage
and increasing numbers of financially vulnerable people are applying for
the vulnerable customer solution. Beneficiaries of this offering, which
protects vulnerable customers who apply for it, numbered over a million
at the end of 2023, i.e. a 320% increase compared with 2015.

Des résultats concrets en matière de détection et d'accompagnement de la clientèle
financièrement fragile...
Bank charges for financially vulnerable customers have fallen
significantly: down 32% between 2018 and 2023 on all account-related
bank charges, from EUR 304 to EUR 207 per year; and down 25%
between 2019 and 2023 on payment incident fees, from EUR 151 to EUR
113. 
...Et une baisse significative des frais bancaires des plus fragiles financièrement

The problem of bank charges was extremely sensitive and often made it
into the media. It has not disappeared, but it has been significantly
improved.
III. A partnership and regional
approach
The OIB also embodies the success of a partnership and regional
approach to preventing financial exclusion. It is neither so common nor
so easy to bring together three very different parties on a regular basis:
the six main banking institutions; six welfare associations and
organisations; and the public authorities. Allow me to highlight three of
their collective achievements.
Une démarche partenariale et territoriale
Image


The creation in 2022 of the departmental financial inclusion councils
(CDIF), above all, enabled the actions of the OIB to be effectively
deployed at the regional level and local difficulties and initiatives to be
identified more effectively. The EDUCFI initiatives of the Banque de
France, the steering body for France’s financial literacy strategy since
2016, are also based on a partnership approach. These initiatives have
helped to raise awareness of EDUCFI tools and services among a large
number of financial inclusion stakeholders: 9,600 teachers, 30,000 social
workers and 3,500 business support staff in 2024. During Financial
Education Week, which this year took place from 17 to 23 March, the
Banque de France and its partners organised more than 500 budgeting
and financial education workshops throughout the country. This week –
whose theme was to encourage young people in particular to be careful
with their finances – was widely publicised in the media and on social
networks, testifying to French citizens' increased interest in developing
their financial knowledge.  Lastly, I will touch on the 500 Budget
Management Advice Offices (PCBs) set up throughout France since
2021: these organisations approved by the state and run largely by
associations or CCASs  that are members of the OIB, enable all people to
benefit from personalised, free and confidential guidance. 
IV. Building for the future
We now need to ensure that the substantial progress achieved through
the OIB's actions is sustained, while remaining vigilant in the face of the
current situation of overindebtedness and emerging risks. 

Pérenniser ces 10 ans d'action de l'OIB
I will start with some relatively encouraging news about the number of
applications to the household debt commissions. Over the first two
months of 2025, the slower increase in the number of applications
observed at the end of 2024 was confirmed, 3% higher than during the
same period at the start of 2024. We are expecting a similar modest
increase for 2025 as a whole. The positive effects of the decline in
inflation – with the attendant gains in purchasing power – should offset
the less favourable labour market outlook. These developments are
nevertheless part of a long-term downward trend in the number of
applications: in 2024, there were significantly fewer than in the pre-
pandemic period (-6%) and the number was well below the level of 10
years ago (-42% compared to 2024).

Beyond these cyclical factors, I would like to mention three points of
vigilance. The increasing dissemination of new products, such as
microloans and payment in instalments, poses increased risks to
vulnerable populations, including the very young. The transposition of
the recent directive on consumer credit should provide a better
framework for these new forms of credit. And I would recommend
systematic consultation of the National Database of Household Credit
Repayment Incidents by all parties before granting loans. This would help
to improve consumer protection and prevent financial difficulties and
overindebtedness. Microcredit is also an effective tool for financial
inclusion, with outstanding loans exceeding EUR 2 billion at the end of
2023. We are therefore carefully monitoring changes in the ecosystem
and the recent warnings about funding assistance to microloan
beneficiaries. This assistance is currently provided by associations and
social welfare agencies that support the beneficiary throughout the
process. Let me reiterate that it is the key feature and the key to the
success of the French microcredit system. Lastly, with regard to the
right to a bank account, the Banque de France is now ready to move to
paperless designation letters – as recommended by the Cour des
comptes   in 2021 – to further speed up a procedure that has already
been greatly simplified in recent years: banks must now do their part by
adhering to this project by the end of 2025. I hope that voluntary action
here will prevent us from having to use compulsory measures. 
I will finish with these words by Victor Hugo: "for as long as the possible
is not done, our duty will never be fulfilled".   We are currently
experiencing a historical turning point in the world, and our country's
response may not live up to the occasion, nor to our duty, and I do not
say this lightly. In its own modest way, the OIB’s first ten years have
nevertheless shown us how to raise the level of our debate and action:
through persistence and staying power; quantified evaluation, from ex
ante observations to results; a partnership and regional approach; and
constant vigilance for the future. The OIB has been able to extend its
timeframe beyond day-to-day concerns, bring together different parties
and move beyond the usual French-style squabbling. More broadly, you
can count on the Banque de France – and no doubt, dear Pierre, on the
Cour des Comptes – to foster this spirit more than ever, thanks to its
independence and its stability missions.
