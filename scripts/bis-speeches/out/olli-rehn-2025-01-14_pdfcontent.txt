Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,
Let me start by thanking the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for hosting this topical and 
thought-provoking conference. Discussing the changing global economy in "Asia's 
World City" is, of course, very appropriate.
I would also like to thank the representatives of the European Central Bank for their 
involvement in putting together the programme for this excellent event. This conference 
is a good example of fruitful cooperation between central banking authorities from 
different parts of the world, and certainly a tradition worth preserving.
As the title of the conference implies, the global economy is undergoing a 
transformation. In my talk today I would like to address a key aspect of this 
transformation, namely decoupling and fragmentation in the global economy.
Is there evidence of geoeconomic fragmentation in the global trade and investment 
data? Or is global trade simply following the same trajectory as global economic 
output? There is, of course, an important difference between the paths of global trade 
and global output.
Slide 2. A period of normalisation after hyper-globalisation?
We can, in my view, reasonably start the analysis of any decoupling or fragmentation 
with a slide like this, which shows the value of the global goods trade in relation to the 
global gross domestic product (GDP).
We can observe how this percentage climbs in the late 1990s and 2000s, pushed by 
the integration of China and former socialist countries into the global economy and 
global value chains. In the early 1990s global trade was roughly 30% of the global GDP, 
and by 2008 this had increased to over 50%.
As the graph shows, the global financial crisis marked a clear turning point. Since then, 
the level of global trade in relation to global GDP has fluctuated between 45% and 50%. 
Should we call it 'slowbalisation'?

There are of course many reasons for this relative stagnation, but here in Hong Kong 
we should note at least one factor. Whereas in the early 2000s many value chains in 
East Asia were international, by the 2010s a larger share of production had moved into 
one country: China.
If, for example, a component had previously crossed national borders, say, eight times, 
by the 2010s more of the value-added was accruing to Chinese companies, and the 
component would cross national borders only five times.
What is the main implication of this in terms of globalisation currently? So far, various 
trade restrictions and higher tariffs have not been enough to reverse the gains in 
globalisation.
Slide 3. Or a period of structural change?
Another aspect of the transformation of world trade is sectoral. We typically look at the 
trade in goods, but the is often neglected in public debate. The share  trade in services 
of services in total international trade is already about one quarter, and this has been 
increasing. I am confident that this trend will continue in the coming years.
In many OECD countries, including the United States and Finland, services already 
account for one third of their total external trade.
With telecommunications costs falling, many companies even in middle-income 
countries can participate effectively in the global trade in services. This is hopefully and 
perhaps also likely an area where trade barriers of various kinds will be more difficult to 
implement.
Slide 4. Geopolitical risks can materialise: Russia's invasion of Ukraine also 
harmed the euro area economy
Trade restrictions and tariffs are not the only geopolitical factors that can affect trade 
and economic development. Clearly, major geopolitical events and shocks can have 
huge consequences.
Russia's illegal and brutal invasion of Ukraine has been devastating for Ukraine and the 
Ukrainian people. At the same time, it has also been a massive negative supply shock 
and an adverse geopolitical shock for the euro area. According to the Bank of Finland's 
analysis, this shock caused the inflation rate in the euro area to be 2 percentage points 
higher, and GDP to be correspondingly lower, than would otherwise have been the 
case.
It is also worth noting that the energy price shock following Russia's invasion was not 
limited to Europe. Global energy prices went up, and this had a negative effect in Asia 
too. What happens in Europe doesn't stay in Europe.
Slide 5. How do geopolitics and tariffs show up in trade data?

3/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Furthermore, even if tariffs and protectionism have not yet led to a decline in total global 
trade, this may not be the case in the future.
We are already witnessing signs of trade fragmentation, primarily in two significant 
ways.
Firstly, bilateral trade between the US and China has stalled, and some supply chains 
have been relocated from China to Southeast Asia, Mexico and emerging economies in 
Europe. These shifts aim to mitigate supply chain disruption risks and avoid import 
tariffs or export restrictions.
Secondly, Russia's war in Ukraine has effectively isolated Russia from the European 
Union, the G7 countries and their allies. This has resulted in a dramatic reduction in 
trade between the EU and Russia since February 2022. The goal of the sanctions is 
clear: to cause damage to the Russian war machine and its imperialistic invasion.
Slide 6. Domestic value-added has decreased in the EU
In this complex environment, it is useful to examine whether production is being 
reshored  transferred back home  at significant levels. In other words, is globalisation 
truly reversing?
Our staff analysis of the origins of value-added in manufacturing indicates that in the 
United States, the share of domestically produced value-added increased between 
2018 and 2023. Conversely, in the EU, there was a small decrease in domestic value-
added. This suggests some reshoring dynamics in the US and the opposite in Europe.
Slide 7. Chinese value-added has increased in the EU and remains unchanged in 
the US
Our findings also highlight the challenges of decoupling or de-risking from China, due to 
the deeply integrated nature of global production networks. Even though direct trade 
between China and the United States shows signs of a modest decline, the share of 
Chinese value-added in US manufacturing imports remained stable during the period 
examined. It appears that value chains are simply being re-routed through connector 
countries like Mexico and Vietnam.
In the European Union, Chinese value-added in manufacturing has in fact increased 
since 2018. This illustrates the challenges related to even moderate decoupling, which 
in Europe is seen as necessary de-risking in today's geopolitical context.
In this challenging global context, the European Central Bank's monetary policy aims at 
ensuring price stability, which also supports the EU's general economic policies.

In this challenging global context, the European Central Bank's monetary policy aims at 
ensuring price stability, which also supports the EU's general economic policies.

Slide 9. Euro area inflation is stabilising at the 2% target
In the euro area, disinflation is well on track. Wage pressures have also somewhat 
receded. Meanwhile the growth outlook has weakened. This has prompted us at the 
ECB's Governing Council to cut interest rates four times in the last six months.
Going forward, the direction of our monetary policy is clear. The scope and speed of 
rate cuts will depend on incoming data regarding three factors, in particular: the inflation 
outlook, the underlying inflation dynamics and monetary policy transmission.
The Governing Council will decide on interest rates in each of its monetary policy 
meetings, taking into account all the new information and analysis that has accrued 
since the previous meeting. In the forthcoming meetings we should also have more 
information on the policies of the incoming US administration and on the European 
response to those policies.
In light of the current economic outlook and our reaction functions, I would assume that 
our monetary policy will leave restrictive territory in the coming months, at the latest by 
midsummer.
Slide 10. Concluding remarks
So, is the glass of global trade half empty or half full?
Total trade has held up so far, perhaps surprisingly well. Services have become more 
and more important in global trade, and this trend will continue.
But we must not be complacent. Geopolitical shocks, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine 
or higher barriers to trade, can have negative effects on our economies.
Tariffs between any two countries, like the US and China, may often be circumvented 
one way or another. Companies are nimble in moving production to avoid tariffs. This 
kind of adaptation makes economies more resilient, but at the same time it does add to 
the costs of doing business. If considerably higher tariffs or other trade restrictions were 
introduced, these costs of doing business would increase more significantly – for all of 
us.
Furthermore, such a trade war could have a negative impact in other areas as well. 
Fraying and frozen international relations would, in turn, make ending a trade war more 
difficult. There are no winners in a trade war.
This is the reason why we in Finland and Europe continue to defend the rules-based 
international order in security and trade and the legal rights of independent nations – in 
Europe, in the global South and across the world. In my view, this is crucial for global 
peace and development of the humankind.
Thank you for your attention!
