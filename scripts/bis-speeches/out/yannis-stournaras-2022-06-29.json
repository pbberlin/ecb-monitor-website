It is an honour for me to address so many different experts, representing the whole spectrum of payments in the international scene, both from the central bank community and the industry.</p>\n<p>Payments and payment systems constitute a core area of interest for central banks. They constitute the platform for the execution of monetary operations, and they provide the basis of trust and confidence for all citizens, when using the currency in their transactions, every single day and time.</p>\n<p>Today, more than at any time in the past, we are at a critical point as regards central banks' policies in payments:</p>\n<p>-Technology in this area is evolving fast, faster than ever;</p>\n<p>-innovation and transformation are the norm, not the exception;</p>\n<p>-the universe of players and actors in the payment industry has become vast and diverse;</p>\n<p>-and different industries (beyond the financial sector) are striving for a role in the payments landscape.</p>\n<p>The Eurosystem has demonstrated important work and achievements in both wholesale and retail payments. The cornerstone of its retail payments policy in the last two decades had been to promote cashless payments, especially via the SEPA and other initiatives, harmonization of market practices and a coherent oversight approach. But today we are far beyond that point, as we are facing new challenges: to respond to the need for more innovation, more speed and convenience, and also to ensure broader access of all citizens to innovative payment instruments.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the challenge is to preserve the crucial role of central bank money across the chain of the payment spectrum and maintain public trust and confidence in the use of the currency. This becomes more and more important as we observe constant contraction in the use of cash, which today constitutes the only form of central bank money from the retail payments perspective. And perhaps even more important in a backdrop of the development of alternative, private instruments and schemes that operate outside the perimeter of monetary sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Eurosystem's initiatives to address such new challenges are well known. There are policies in support of instant payments, actions to enhance wholesale payment services, and work in progress related to the potential introduction of a digital euro. It is also taking part in the broader effort of the central bank community to enhance interoperability between different systems and schemes at the international level.</p>\n<p>The Bank of Greece is a warm supporter of such initiatives. And in what regards the payments environment in Greece, it takes concrete actions, using the full potential of its different institutional roles – as policy maker, as system operator and as fiscal agent of the Government. The Bank of Greece is keen, in that context, to make use of this particular momentum of a broader effort that is now unfolding to digitalize the functions of the Greek public sector.</p>\n<p>Historically, the Bank of Greece had the role of initiator for critical infrastructure projects in the financial sector, among which was the setting up the Greek retail payment scheme. And today the central bank remains the main actor behind the particular scheme's constant innovation and integration in the EU payments landscape. An important milestone, in this context, has been the adherence to TARGET Instant Payments scheme (TIPS) at the end of 2021. Another important milestone coming soon is the Bank of Greece's launch of SEPA-Instant for government-related payments, whereby the central bank will become a TIPS participant on behalf of the government.
