1/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Fabio Panetta: Solidarity and cooperation - from local communities to 
global stability
Speech by Mr Fabio Panetta, Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the Conference 
"Cooperative financial institutions in the 21st century for global economic and social 
development", Rome, 8 October 2025.
* * *
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a great pleasure to welcome you to Rome and to open this conference on the role 
of cooperative financial institutions in the twenty-first century.
This Jubilee year is dedicated to hope, a virtue that looks to the future, but cannot 
flourish without solidarity, justice, and a strong sense of responsibility towards future 
generations. These are not abstract ideals, but the very foundations of resilient 
societies and stable economies.
Let me address two economic themes that are closely linked to these principles.
The first is cooperative finance - a model that, through proximity and mutual trust, has 
long promoted inclusion and balanced growth.
The second is the debt burden of low-income countries - a challenge that reminds us 
that solidarity must reach beyond national borders if we are to create the conditions for 
global stability and prosperity.
Both issues are rooted in the same idea: credit and debt are not just financial 
instruments, but expressions of trust and responsibility. And when debt in poor 
countries becomes unsustainable, that very sense of responsibility calls on creditors 
and debtors alike to work together to find solutions that are equitable and conducive to 
growth.
1. Cooperative banks in a changing world
Cooperative finance has long been rooted in communities. Its democratic governance, 
its focus on members' needs and its tradition of responsibility make it a distinctive 
model for intermediation. Long before the principles of environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) responsibility became common parlance, cooperatives were already 
putting them into practice.
Over time, these institutions have expanded access to finance for households and small 
businesses, supporting millions who would otherwise have been excluded. Their 
importance is evident in both advanced and developing economies: they foster 
inclusion, resilience, and sustainable growth.
In Europe alone, cooperative banks employ over 700,000 people and serve more than 
90 million members.They are also well-represented outside Europe, with about 100 1

million members.Credit unions are present in more than 100 countries, counting over 2 
400 million members.In regions facing poverty, conflict or climate stress they often 3 
remain the only reliable providers of credit.
Research shows that their relationship-based lending helps to smooth credit cycles,4 
sustain customers during downturns and promote more balanced and sustainable 
growth.Far from being less efficient than commercial banks,many cooperatives 5  6 
match them in profitability and credit quality, while also reducing inequality.7
Emerging challenges
The cooperative model is not without weaknesses. Its small size hinders economies of 
scale, its concentration in local markets reduces diversification, and its strong 
community ties may blur risk management. In advanced economies, the declining share 
of small and medium-sized enterprises in total production is reducing demand for 
traditional relationship lending. The rising share of intangible assets in firms' balance 
sheets - such as software, data, and intellectual property - complicates screening and 
credit risk management for small lenders.
In this environment, cooperative banks can no longer rely solely on their historical 
advantages over commercial banks. Expanding loan portfolios, a strategy that once 
sustained the growth of cooperative intermediaries, has become more difficult and 
entails higher risks. Cooperatives will need to adapt their strategies, leveraging 
innovation and partnerships, while remaining faithful to their founding mission of serving 
communities.
2. From local credit to global solidarity
Just as social capital is the foundation for cooperative credit within local communities, 
'international social capital' is essential to revitalize multilateral cooperation. The same 
principles - trust, responsibility, and solidarity - that sustain cooperatives at the local 
level must guide the international community in supporting poor countries and 
addressing poverty, inequality, and the burden of unsustainable debt.
Progress and persisting inequalities
Over the past decades, humanity has achieved extraordinary progress in reducing 
extreme poverty. The share of people living on less than the bare minimum fell from 
over 40 per cent in 1990 to 11 per cent at the end of the last decade. In absolute terms, 
this means a decline from 2.3 billion to 900 million individuals.Unfortunately, in recent 8 
years, due to multiple shocks, this progress has stalled.
The success achieved has not been universal. In sub-Saharan Africa, the picture is 
tragically different. Here, the number of people living in extreme poverty almost doubled 
between 1990 and 2020, reflecting rapid demographic growth and more modest 
reductions in poverty rates - from 55 to 46 per cent.9
Debt as a barrier to development

3/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
While poverty remains widespread, low-income countries are once again facing a 
familiar challenge: unsustainable levels of public debt. This burden not only constrains 
economic development, but also hinders poverty reduction and undermines social 
stability.
These countries account for just 2.5 per cent of global GDP and 1.4 per cent of global 
public debt, but they are home to 1.8 billion people - nearly one quarter of humanity. 
Their weight in the global economy may be small, but the human consequences of their 
plight are immense. In such social and political circumstances, debt reduction is not 
only an economic necessity, it is a moral duty. Furthermore, poverty is a powerful driver 
of irregular migration, which is putting increasing strains on many advanced economies.
The debt-to-GDP ratio peaks of the 1990s led to unprecedented initiatives for debt 
cancellation (the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, HIPC). Today, debt ratios 
among poor countries are below those peaks, yet vulnerabilities have resurfaced. Over 
the past fifteen years, median debt levels have risen sharply, from 30 per cent of GDP 
in 2010 to 50 per cent in 2024, while debt servicing costs have escalated, diverting 
resources from schools, hospitals, and infrastructure.10
The evolving creditor landscape complicates achieving an agreement on debt 
restructuring. Alongside multilateral institutions and the Paris Club, private investors 
and new bilateral lenders - most prominently China - now play a central role. This 
enlargement, while offering more financing options, has made coordination during 
crises more difficult and weakened traditional mechanisms for debt resolution.
It would therefore be misleading to think that simply replicating the HIPC initiative today, 
in such a profoundly changed context, would be sufficient. Innovative approaches and a 
substantial reformulation of the terms of the discussion are instead necessary.
Towards a renewed multilateral response
The complexity of today's debt challenge requires a comprehensive and coordinated 
global response, one that encompasses crisis prevention, debt relief, and growth 
promotion.
For countries caught in unsustainable debt cycles, restructuring is essential. The 
Common Framework endorsed by the G20 in November 2020was a step forward, 11 
bringing traditional and new creditors to the same table. Yet implementation has been 
slow and uneven, revealing the need for greater transparency, predictability, and speed. 
Unfortunately, the current geopolitical climate is diminishing hopes of a coordinated 
global response to debt.
Restructuring is the last resort, prevention remains central. Liquidity strains can be 
mitigated through cheaper refinancing, affordable lending, and innovative instruments 
such as climate-resilient debt clauses, which suspend payments in the event of natural 
disasters. Furthermore, developing local currency debt markets would reduce these 
countries' dependence on foreign financing, thereby mitigating their exposure to 
currency fluctuations and allowing them to fund long-term investment programmes.

Ultimately, however, the safest way to restore debt sustainability is to foster balanced 
and inclusive growth. Debt relief must therefore be paired with reforms that strengthen 
institutions and broaden the tax base. Financial support is most effective when tied to 
clear performance-based frameworks.
The international community should explore innovative solutions, such as debt-for-
development swaps, which channel resources into education, health, and climate 
action. Initiatives like Italy's recent proposal to free up funds for African countries and 
reinvest them in locally owned development programmes are a promising path.
The debt of low-income countries is not a peripheral issue but a central global 
challenge. Failure to act will leave 1.8 billion people behind, with consequences for 
global stability and justice. Multilateral cooperation is not a burden: it is a strategic 
investment. At a time of fragmentation and nationalism, we must renew our commitment 
to solidarity.
The reduction of debt, when accompanied by reform and growth, can turn a crushing 
burden into a lever for development, a tool for eradicating poverty, and a catalyst for 
inclusive prosperity.
3. Conclusions
The brief reflections I have shared today point to a single truth: solidarity is a necessity, 
not an option. The fact that the world these days seems to overlook this statement does 
not make it untrue. Solidarity is the foundation for resilient communities, the engine of 
sustainable economies, and the glue that holds an increasingly fragile world together.
We must preserve and nurture our social capital, both locally and globally. Cooperation 
can be laborious, but it is precious because it is an investment in stability, security, and 
justice.
Leaving almost two billion people behind is hardly a reliable foundation for stability and 
prosperity, worldwide as well as in advanced economies. Let us therefore ensure that 
credit, whether extended within a village or across nations, serves its highest purpose: 
to build trust, to foster dignity, and to lead the way towards a more just and humane 
world.

driven by the rapid economic development of emerging Asian economies, particularly 
China. In East Asia and the Pacific, the extreme poverty rate dropped from 76 per cent 
to 2 per cent, lifting 1.2 billion people out of destitution.

representing over two thirds of the global total.
