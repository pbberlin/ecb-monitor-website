SPEECH
Underlying inflation: an update
Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the
ECB, at the Inflation: Drivers and Dynamics Conference 2024
organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the ECB
Cleveland, 24 October 2024
Introduction
My aim today is to provide an update on underlying inflation in the euro area“] The concept of
underlying inflation plays a central role in the conduct of the ECB’s monetary policy: our interest rate
decisions are based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and
financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
This three-pronged reaction function complements the traditional focus on the inflation forecast for
inflation-targeting central banks with the signals embodied in underlying inflation measures, while also
incorporating the evolving evidence on the strength of monetary policy transmission in the calibration of
the monetary stance. This pragmatic approach reflects the value of data dependence under highly
atypical macroeconomic conditions.
Latest developments in euro area underlying inflation
Underlying inflation is the persistent component of inflation, signalling where headline inflation will settle
in the medium term after temporary factors have vanished. In practice, underlying inflation is
unobservable and needs to be proxied or estimated. There are two broad categories of measures that
aim to capture this concept. Exclusion-based measures omit certain items — such as energy and food —
that are typically volatile and more sensitive to global factors than domestic fundamentals. Model-based
measures, meanwhile, capture more complex channels and dynamics, subject to the limitations
imposed by sensitivity to model estimation. An overview of such measures is shown in Chart 1.
Model-based measures at the ECB include the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCl),
which is constructed by estimating a dynamic factor model that extracts the persistent and common
component of inflation from granular price data at the item-country level, thereby exploiting the relative
advantages of both cross-sectional and time series approaches./4] Another model-based measure is
Supercore inflation, which picks out those items that are estimated to co-move with the business cycle.
These model-based measures are reduced form in nature and, among other factors, reflect the
empirical contribution of monetary policy tightening to delivering disinflation. That is to say, if current
inflation is above target, one reason why underlying inflation might run below current inflation is that the
projected mean reversion is partly driven by endogenous monetary policy tightening that has
historically contributed to the return of inflation to the target over the medium term. In turn, monitoring


the evolution of underlying inflation is an important element in diagnosing whether monetary policy is
appropriately calibrated.
Each of the underlying inflation indicators tracked by the ECB has declined significantly since the post-
pandemic inflation surges, with the range narrowing towards its historical average. The majority of
indicators are hovering around 1.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent, down from a much wider range between 3.4
per cent to 7.5 per cent at its peak (Chart 1). Core inflation is the most prominent exclusion-based
measure, defined as HICP inflation excluding energy and food: this edged down to 2.7 per cent in
September, continuing the marked decline from 4.5 per cent a year ago.lin terms of model-based
measures, the PCCI today is at the bottom of the range, standing at 1.9 per cent in September and
having hovered around 2.0 per cent since the end of last year. Most other measures that we regularly
monitor have also come down over the past year and show signs of continued easing in September.
One challenge in interpreting standard indicators of underlying inflation is that these were affected by
the past extraordinary supply shocks, as well as by temporary mismatches between demand and
supply. As | pointed out in my March 2023 speech, it is helpful to think of headline inflation as being
driven by three factors: (i) underlying inflation; (ii) a reverting component; and (iii) pure noise.4! In
particular, the major dislocations of recent years induced a substantial reverting component of inflation
that was sufficiently long-lasting not to constitute pure noise but that was also expected to fade out over
time. These dislocations included the impact of energy inflation and supply bottlenecks. To capture their
indirect impact on measures of underlying inflation, we have in parallel monitored adjusted measures of
underlying inflation that “partial out” these indirect influences. These adjusted measures had a
significantly lower peak rate of underlying inflation than the un-adjusted measures but, by construction,
were also less affected by the sharp turnaround in energy prices and easing of supply bottlenecks
during 2023 that flattered the speed of progress in the un-adjusted measures. Currently, these
adjustments bring down the range to between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent, as the impact of past supply-
side shocks has greatly diminished. In particular, the forward-looking PCCI measures are by now free
of such impacts.

Notes: HICPX stands for HICP inflation excluding energy and food; HICPXX for HICP inflation excluding energy,
food, travel-related items, clothing and footwear; PCCI is the persistent and common component of inflation, while
Supercore aggregates HICPX items sensitive to domestic business cycle. See also Banbura et al. (2023),
‘adjusted’ measures abstract from energy and supply-bottlenecks shocks using a large SVAR, see Banbura, M.,
Bobeica, E. and Martinez-Hernandez, C. 2023, “What drives core inflation? The role of supply shocks.”, ECB
Working Paper No 2875.
The latest observations are for September 2024.
Each measure of underlying inflation provides useful information about future headline inflation,
although their forecasting performance varies. Chart 2 shows the root mean squared forecast error
(RMSFE) for each measure vis-a-vis inflation two years ahead and vis-a-vis a smoothed inflation rate.
Forecasting performance is normalised to the predictive power of current headline inflation: that is, a
ratio below unity means that the measure does a better job than current headline inflation in forecasting
future inflation. Indeed, most measures beat current headline inflation in forecasting future inflation. The
PCCI measures have the best predictive power, while most exclusion-based measures perform less
well.
However, in understanding the inflation process and calibrating monetary policy, it is essential to look
beyond overall predictive power and also examine how the various underlying inflation measures can
shed light on the speed and sequencing of the disinflation process. For instance, external shocks were
a prominent feature of the post-pandemic economic landscape.! While the PCCI measures provided a
powerful signal that these shocks would ultimately fade out, the delayed and lagged adjustment in
indicators such as services inflation, domestic inflation and wage growth served to highlight that


convergence to the medium-term target would not be immediate.! | will focus on these indicators in
the next part of my talk.

indicates that the measure performs better than headline inflation. The sample covers the period from April 2001 to
September 2024.
Services, domestic inflation and wages
Domestic inflation captures price dynamics in consumption items that are less influenced by external
factors, being more determined by domestic economic conditions, including monetary policy. While
trends in the relative prices of globally-determined components (mostly in the energy, food and goods
categories) mean that the two per cent target for overall inflation is not a target for domestic inflation,
domestic inflation cannot remain at an excessive level if the target is to be sustainably achieved.
Moreover, assessing the strength of domestic inflation is essential to the calibration of monetary policy,
since domestic inflation will be more responsive than global inflation components to the impact of
monetary policy via the dampening of domestic demand.
The domestic inflation indicator monitored at the ECB is an aggregation of HICP items with low import
content.2] As shown in Chart 3, domestic inflation and services inflation co-move closely. This reflects
the dominance of services items in the domestic inflation measures, accounting for 97 per cent of the
overall index. At the same time, it remains useful to maintain domestic inflation and services inflation as
separate measures: while almost 80 per cent of the services items are included in the domestic inflation
index, the overall services category also includes highly-traded services items (Chart 4). These
internationally-traded services items currently have a lower contribution to services inflation than
domestic services items.

Notes: The chart shows all services items and the x axis shows the contribution of each item to total services
inflation in September 2024. In weighted terms, 80 per cent of services are in domestic inflation and 97 per cent of
domestic inflation is composed of services items. Domestic inflation also includes three good items which are not
shown on the chart.
The large supply-side shocks of the post-pandemic period have been feeding through to domestic
inflation with a lag compared with other measures of underlying inflation. Large supply-side shocks
have travelled across sectors and consumption items at different speeds, so it is unsurprising that
these had differential impacts on the various measures of underlying inflation, depending on their
nature and construction.
Domestic inflation and services inflation tend to lag headline inflation more than other measures,
exhibiting a lower frequency of price adjustment compared with the energy, food and goods categories
in the HICP“lFor this reason, many items in services inflation and domestic inflation were late movers
that responded with a much longer lag to the latest inflationary shock, such that annual services
inflation remains elevated.“°l Chart 5 shows the impact of energy and supply-chain bottlenecks on the
PCCls, domestic inflation and other measures of underlying inflation. Among these measures, PCCls
are more forward-looking and have picked up certain shocks faster, but with the byproduct that the
effects of the shocks also faded quicker. Other indicators, like domestic inflation, are more backward-
looking, and the currently higher levels also reflect the still ongoing propagation of past shocks. In
similar vein, the past shocks took longer to build up in domestic inflation and are also taking longer to
dissipate.

The latest observations are for September 2024.
The PCCI for services indicates that there is currently a sizeable gap between services inflation and its
medium-term underlying trend, suggesting there is scope for downward adjustment in services inflation
in the coming months. Services PCCI has been around 2.4 per cent since the end of last year, well
below the current annual rate for services (Chart 6, left panel).(“ This difference suggests that
idiosyncratic and non-persistent factors are currently driving services inflation. Examples of such
idiosyncratic factors include the base effect related to the introduction of the cheap travel Deutschland-
ticket in Germany in May 2023, rent inflation in the Netherlands, and items that reprice less frequently,
such as insurance or other administered prices (like hospital services) in some countries.
Over time, the fading out of these idiosyncratic and temporary factors should means that services
inflation declines towards the underlying rate. Indeed, momentum indicators for services confirm the
slight easing of inflation dynamics. While services momentum (i.e. the three-month-on-three-month
growth rate of the seasonally-adjusted index) remains high, it has been continuously easing since May
(Chart 6, right panel). The month-on-month seasonally-adjusted rate markedly dropped in September.

Services and domestic inflation are closely linked to wage growth: the expected easing of wage growth
in 2025, together with the impact of past monetary policy tightening, should contribute to further
disinflation. Wages constitute a higher direct share in costs of services than goods and Chart 7
highlights the strong link between domestic inflation, services and wages: their level is normally similar
and they closely co-move with each other.“:! Chart 7 also shows how pressures in these three
components can take time to moderate following a tightening in policy.

Wage growth is expected to ease from its current high level, with the cumulative increase in nominal
wages over 2023-2024 largely restoring the purchasing power that was lost during the inflation surges
of 2021-2022. Wage pressures are currently still high: the growth rate of compensation per employee
stood at 4.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2024, albeit down from its peak of 5.6 per cent in the
second quarter of 2023.
Recently, the incoming information for 2024 in the ECB wage tracker indicator of latest agreements
shows that wage agreements signed in 2024 had substantially lower structural wage growth for the
next 12 months if their previous agreement was signed in 2023 or 2022, as compared with 2021 (Chart
8, left panel). Moreover, in the months ahead, there are fewer wage agreements coming up for
renegotiation that have not had an agreement since the surge in inflation (Chart 8, right panel). This
suggests that the catching up motive in wage negotiations is losing ground as inflation normalises.
Forward-looking indicators suggest further diminishing wage pressures into 2025 (Chart 9). The
forward-looking wage tracker (dark blue line in Chart 9) shows the wage growth until the end of 2025 in
the available contracts that have been agreed and signed.


One caveat in interpreting developments in the forward- looking wage tracker is that, since it only
considers agreements that are active in the future, the contract coverage on which it is based declines
as contracts expire (solid grey area in Chart 9). For this reason, scenarios for the expiring contracts (in
the grey striped area) can help to assess risks around the outlook for wages. The scenarios illustrated
in Chart 9 assume different renegotiated annual wage growth for expired contracts: (i) full pass-through
of HICP and real productivity growth top-up to wages; (ii) HICPX and real productivity growth top-up to
wages; (iii) wages increase at the same very strong level as contracts signed in the second quarter of
2024 that were still recouping large real wage losses (this is an upper bound scenario). Even this
upper-bound scenario points to a slowdown in wage pressures in 2025 compared with 2024. This
reflects in part that base effects, for example those related to high one-off payments this year, will
dampen future wage growth in year-on-year terms.

The latest information from surveys reinforces the projection of easing wage growth that will underpin
the moderation in services inflation and domestic inflation. Chart 10 presents consecutive rounds of
various ECB surveys, which provide a wealth of valuable information that helps us gauge the pulse of
the economy in real time. The incoming survey information on wage growth provided by both firms and
professional forecasters confirm the narrative embedded in our September 2024 ECB staff projection
that wage growth will ease in 2025 compared with 2024, primarily owing to the fading out of the catch-
up dynamic that has dominated wage negotiations between 2022 and 2024.

In summary, in analysing services inflation and domestic inflation, it is crucial to distinguish between the
underlying persistent component that matters for the medium term and the backward-looking reverting
component that takes time to fade out but that ultimately reflects the staggered nature of the
adjustment process to the original and extraordinary inflation shocks. This backward-looking
component has been substantial: the inflation shocks of 2021-2022 spread across sectors at varying
speeds. The slowest-moving sectors were those in which prices adjust more slowly or are most closely
tied to wage adjustment. For these indicators, we need patience as the normalisation process takes
time.
Conclusion
In my remarks today, | have sought to provide an update on the dynamics of underlying inflation. | have
emphasised that underlying inflation measures not only serve to extract the persistent component from
the latest inflation readings but also provide insights into the nature of disinflation, especially in relation
to the staggered nature of the adjustment process. In particular, the analysis of underlying inflation
suggests that 2024 is a transition year, in which backward-looking components are still playing out. But
the analysis of underlying inflation also indicates that the disinflation process is well on track, and
inflation is set to return to target in the course of 2025.

This is confirmed when employing a forecast combination algorithm for the available underlying inflation
measures designed to minimise the two-year ahead RMSFE for headline inflation. Over time, the
algorithm tends to pick one or more of the monitored measures, but recently PCCls have prevailed.

To the extent that trend productivity growth is higher in more tradable sectors such as manufacturing
than in less tradable sectors such as services, the relative price of services will trend higher over time
so that the average inflation rate for services will be higher than for goods. At the same time, the
equilibrium relative price of services versus goods can shift over time due to a range of factors.
