But this evening I would like to single out one achievement in particular: Brunelleschi's dome, which crowns this city's cathedral. Not because the dome is beautiful and inspiring – it is undeniably both – but because its remarkable history offers inspiration for Europe today. Florence began building its cathedral in the late 1200s. Yet, for more than a century, it remained unfinished. The challenge was to build a dome on such a scale that no one knew how to achieve it. It did not help that, during this time, Florence was hit by shocks like the Black Death pandemic and wars, which understandably caused the city to delay in finishing what it had started. But Florence remained undeterred, and, in 1418, it launched a design competition to build the dome. The architect Brunelleschi won that competition with a game-changing approach to architecture – breaking from tradition and rethinking how large structures could stand without external supports. For instance, he used a herringbone brick pattern to keep each layer stable as it rose, avoiding the usual need for wooden scaffolding. He also embedded horizontal stone and iron chains that acted as tension rings to contain the dome's outward thrust. Equally daring was his decision to build a double-shell dome – an inner shell to bear the immense weight, an outer one to protect it – and applying this idea on a scale never attempted. During the sixteen years it took to build the dome, some contemporaries were convinced it would collapse during construction. After all, something like this had never been done before. But Brunelleschi defied them all, and thanks to that resolve we can still enjoy the fruits of his success. The story of Florence's cathedral and its dome is the story of modern Europe, itself a cathedral of nations. There are three parallels worth drawing here. First, we are part of a visionary project that many once thought impossible – and this country provided some of the master builders of that vision. Think of Alcide De Gasperi, who helped lay the foundations; Altiero Spinelli, who imagined a federal architecture long before it seemed possible; and my predecessor, Mario Draghi, who, at a moment when Europe's future was in existential doubt, showed that resolve can be as important as design. Second, like the dome, Europe has withstood storms that might well have brought it down. In just the past five years, we have confronted the worst pandemic since the 1920s, the highest US tariffs since the 1930s, the deepest energy shock since the 1970s and the most devastating land war on European soil since the 1990s.
