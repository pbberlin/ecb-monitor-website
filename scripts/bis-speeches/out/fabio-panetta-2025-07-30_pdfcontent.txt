Fabio Panetta
Milan, 11 July 2025



The international financial system has revolved around the dollar for decades: 
it has been an anchor for the monetary policies of many countries, a safe haven for 
investors in times of uncertainty, and the leading benchmark currency for global 
trade in goods and services.
Capital inflows into the United States – partly driven by persistent trade 
deficits – have led to a significant accumulation of liabilities toward foreign 
creditors, increasing international investors’ exposure to US market risks.
In recent years, two trends have amplified this exposure.
The first is the sharp rise in the stock market value of American big techs, 
further tilting global portfolios toward the US market.
The second is interest rate risk on dollar-denominated portfolios. After the global 
financial crisis, a protracted period of low yields and small term premiums encouraged 
the issuance of long-term securities, which were rapidly absorbed by investors. This 
led to greater exposure to interest rate risk on assets denominated in US dollars.
More recently, mounting global uncertainty has led to increased yield volatility. 
As a result, interest rate risk has become more costly to bear, as indicated by the 
rise in the term premium on long-term US Treasury securities (Figure 1).

This is the context within which the recent developments in international 
financial markets have unfolded.
1. The weakening of the dollar 
The announcements of 2 April initiated a round of complex negotiations 
between the United States and its main trading partners, generating instability in 
capital markets. At the same time, concerns grew about the sustainability of US 
public finances, culminating in a downgrading of the sovereign credit rating. For 
the first time in decades, the pivotal role of the dollar in the global financial system 
was openly called into question.
This prompted international investors to begin scaling back their exposure to 
the US market. Many of them opted to increase their hedges against exchange rate 
risk on the dollar (Figure 2) – the economic equivalent of a partial divestment of 
dollar-denominated assets – while simultaneously shortening the financial duration 
of their portfolios.
Yields on long-term US Treasury securities have risen, while the dollar 
has weakened, in a pattern that breaks with previous episodes of financial stress  
(Figure 3).
Even after the tensions had subsided, the US currency continued to lose ground, 
diverging from the interest rate differential between the United States and Europe 
(Figure 4). According to our estimates, more than half of the depreciation against

the euro since the beginning of March is attributable to a growing perception of 
risk associated with the US dollar.
Repercussions for the European financial system
Lately there have been signs that Europe is beginning to benefit from growing 
currency diversification by international investors. In the past few months, inflows 
to foreign funds specializing in European equities and appetite for low-risk euro-
denominated assets have both increased.
The extent of these movements remains limited, however. These developments 
are to be expected in the short term, when adjustments tend to occur more easily 
through the prices of financial assets than through volumes.
A large-scale reallocation of global portfolios is being hindered by the lack 
of concrete alternatives to the US financial system. The size and liquidity of US 
equity, bond and government securities markets far exceed those of other major 
financial centres (Figure 5). 
In the medium term, however, these constraints could ease. An increase in 
securities issuance by international players – coupled with greater diversification of 
global demand – could help provide credible alternatives alongside the US markets.

2. European financial integration 
While a downsizing of the central role of US markets could spark tensions 
during the transition phase, it would also open up new opportunities for economies 
that until now have played a secondary role in the global financial system – Europe 
among them.
These are opportunities that must be created. They won’t happen of their own 
accord.
More underdeveloped and less sophisticated than other financial centres, 
Europe’s capital markets partly reflect the structural traits of its real economy: 
the prevalence of small and medium-sized enterprises, primarily financed through 
bank credit; a large public sector that manages many services directly – such as 
healthcare, social security and insurance – that are often more strongly market-
based elsewhere;1 and the low risk appetite of households, which tend to prefer 
safe forms of savings.2
These traits feed into what is by now a consolidated trend: every year, the euro 
area invests less than it saves (€3.2 trillion against €3.7 trillion in 2024; Figure 6), 
while in the United States the reverse is true (€ 5.9 trillion versus €4.7 trillion), and 
it has a positive net international investment position equal to 10 per cent of GDP.
In other words, Europe exports not only goods but also savings, and it does so 
primarily towards the United States.
Yet what weighs most heavily on the development of Europe’s capital markets 
is another weakness: the financial system’s fragmentation along national lines. 3 
This is a profound and long-standing limitation: in 2025, the degree of integration 
of European financial markets remains comparable to the relatively low levels of 
twenty years ago.4
1 In the United States, for example, workers’ social security contributions flow into pension funds that 
invest them in long-term assets. In Europe, instead, pension systems are primarily based on the pay-
as-you-go public pension model, whereby current contributions finance current pensions, generating 
no demand for financial instruments.
2 K. Bekhtiar, P. Fessler, and P. Lindner, ‘Risky assets in Europe and the US: risk vulnerability, risk 
aversion and economic environment ’, European Central Bank, Working Paper Series, 2270, 2019, 
show that 70 per cent of European households report being unwilling to take on financial risks, 
compared with about 40 per cent in the United States.
3 The effects of European financial fragmentation are analysed in F. Panetta, ‘Europe must think big 
to build its capital markets union’, The ECB Blog, 30 August 2023; Banca d’Italia, ‘The Governor’s 
Concluding Remarks’, Rome, 31 May 2024; E. Letta, Much more than a market: speed, security, 
solidarity. Empowering the Single Market to deliver a sustainable future and prosperity for all EU 
Citizens, April 2024; M. Draghi, The future of European competitiveness, September 2024.

While fragmentation may be a constraint, it is not irreversible. Targeted 
policies that play to the strengths of the European economy can make a decisive 
contribution to overcoming it, by providing the continent with the tools it needs to 
retain savings and to channel them towards productive investments.
The European single capital market
Europe’s economy offers three key strengths to investors: a highly skilled 
labour force, a large internal market, and a solid institutional framework based on 
the rule of law.
Effective interaction between these elements can unlock extraordinary 
potential, but for this to happen, the single market must be fully functioning.
Significant progress has been made since the launch of the European project. 
Yet the single market remains incomplete. Its four pillars – goods, services, 
labour and capital – are interdependent and must work as one. While my focus 
today is on the financial pillar, only full integration across all four areas will 
generate tangible benefits for citizens and businesses alike. 5
The European Commission – building on the guidance provided in the Letta 
and Draghi reports – has relaunched the Capital Markets Union (CMU), a project 
initiated in 2015 whose results so far have fallen short of expectations.

and Investment Union’, VIGOnomics, Rome, 30 April 2025.

The CMU is an ambitious initiative, requiring action on multiple fronts: 
harmonization of corporate, bankruptcy and tax laws; standardization of 
disclosure and accounting requirements; and the strengthening of centralized 
market supervision.
But to make it fully operational, one more step is needed: the introduction 
of a European safe asset.
A common risk-free benchmark would provide a safe form of collateral, 
accepted throughout the Union, and would enable the development of strategic 
segments such as corporate bonds and derivatives. It would enhance the 
efficiency of central counterparties and the liquidity of securities trading and 
interbank transactions, and would promote portfolio diversification, reducing 
risk concentration.
But the advantages of the CMU go well beyond the financial sphere.
According to Banca d’Italia estimates, an integrated capital market built 
around a common risk-free asset could lower financing costs for companies 
by half a percentage point, stimulating an additional €150 billion in annual 
investments. This alone could ultimately raise European GDP by 1.5 per cent.
Yet the benefits could be even more far-reaching.
A deeper, more diversified, European capital market would make it easier to 
finance the most dynamic, high-risk and high-value-added business ventures. It 
would support innovation and boost the competitiveness of Europe’s economy. It 
would attract foreign capital, strengthening the international role of the euro.
It would mean creating high-quality, more productive and better paid jobs.
According to our estimates, in this scenario, the overall impact on GDP could be 
more than three times greater than that generated by an increase in investment alone.6
3. Banks and technology
Today, technology is a decisive strategic lever for the banking sector. It 
can boost operational efficiency, strengthen risk analysis and management, 
and enhance service quality. Most importantly, it can help consolidate client 
relationships, one of the enduring strengths of banks.

market integration’, Banca d’Italia, Questioni di Economia e Finanza (Occasional Papers), forthcoming.

Investments in technology and the digitalization of banking services
Over the past ten years, the ratio of technology investment by Italian 
banks to operating expenses has risen by about 2 percentage points. 7 Spending 
on highly innovative technology projects has grown at an even faster pace  
(Figure 7).8
Increased resources for innovation have produced tangible results. The 
intermediaries that invested the most were also those that achieved the greatest 
reductions in cost-to-income ratios.
These benefits also extend to customers. Today, three out of four Italians 
have access to internet banking, with significant time and cost savings. In 2023, 
online current accounts were 70 per cent cheaper than traditional ones. 9
Digitalization has made banking services more accessible. Despite the sharp 
reduction in physical bank branches – a trend under way for more than fifteen 
years – the share of households with at least one current account has increased. 
Innovation has favoured the inclusion of new customer groups, such as young 
people, who tend to prefer remote channels of interaction.
7 Different statistical sources provide different figures but converge on indicating increased investment 
in technology.

Banca d’Italia, starting in 2017; for the main findings, see the FinTech Survey page on the website.

Alongside plenty of benefits, this transformation also presents some 
challenges for those segments of the population that are less financially literate 
or less familiar with technology. Moreover, for some services – such as the 
financing of small businesses or access to cash services – the lack of a physical 
footprint may be a constraint. 10
Banca d’Italia is working with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the 
Italian Banking Association and Poste Italiane to ensure fair and widespread 
access to financial services. In order to succeed, the initiatives to be implemented 
must be based on concrete commitments from the banking system.
Competitive factors for technological transformation
The technological revolution is entering a new, faster, and more intensive 
phase, driven by the advent of artificial intelligence and big data. In this setting, 
three factors are decisive for the competitiveness of financial intermediaries: 
investment levels, the scope of technology use, and outsourcing choices.
Investment levels
According to our FinTech survey, four out of five intermediaries have adopted 
strategies for digital transformation. Investment intensity varies according to 
operational scale. Large banks, with greater financial resources and more robust 
organizational structures, can implement complex technological projects that 
smaller operators would find difficult to replicate.
Some smaller institutions with innovation-focused business models are an 
exception, but overall, the larger the bank, the higher the ratio of technology 
investment to total assets.
Scope of technology use 
As for the scope of technology adoption, most intermediaries – regardless of 
size – already use advanced solutions in their internal processes, from regulatory 
10 The preliminary data of a sample survey of 5,000 micro-entrepreneurs indicate that 7 per cent of 
those polled reported the closure of a bank branch with which it had dealings in the last two years. 
Of these, three quarters mostly complained about difficulties relating to cash management, access to 
credit, and the loss of points of reference for financial consultancy services. Our analyses on access 
to credit by small- and medium-sized enterprises point to a steeper reduction in towns where the most 
branches were closed. 

12
compliance checks to fraud prevention and customer assistance. Banks report that 
the use of AI models in these areas is widespread and growing.11 
The true competitive divide, however, lies in the use of artificial intelligence 
and big data for typical banking activities, first and foremost for creditworthiness 
assessments – an area currently dominated by the big banks (Figure 8). These 
technologies make it possible to process a broader and more varied set of 
information than traditional models, thereby improving risk assessment models 
and the successful early detection of credit deterioration.
Knowing how to integrate these tools into decision-making processes will be 
crucial for competitiveness. According to our analyses, AI can broaden access to 
financing for creditworthy businesses with shorter credit histories or fragmented 
information.12 Moreover, banks that make extensive use of these technologies tend 
to support the most dynamic entrepreneurial ventures more actively.13
These instruments must not, however, be put to unquestioned use. These 
are complex technologies, requiring assessments over long time horizons and 
throughout different phases of the economic cycle. Their integration into decision-

making processes requires profound awareness on the part of banks to avoid 
distortions, especially as regards access to credit for households. Europe’s AI 
regulation covers these aspects.  
Outsourcing strategies
When it comes to developing and rolling out innovative solutions, larger 
banks tend to combine outsourcing with in-house R&D. Smaller banks, by contrast, 
mostly rely on outsourcing.14
These choices reflect well-known mechanisms: investments in technology 
entail high fixed costs that only larger institutions can consistently sustain. For 
smaller banks, outsourcing is therefore a gateway to innovation, but over time it 
can lead to dependency on external providers.
The risks of technological innovation
New technologies present significant opportunities, but they also carry risks 
that, if not carefully managed, can render them ineffective or even harmful. In Italy, 
as elsewhere, both the frequency and severity of operational and cyber incidents 
are on the rise.15
Artificial intelligence has made cyber threats and fraudulent activity more 
sophisticated.16 Developments in quantum computing could end up compromising 
the efficacy of the cryptographic systems on which the security of financial 
transactions and payments, as well as of dematerialized assets is based; 17 we are 
already witnessing thefts of encrypted data, carried out with the goal of decrypting 
them once the technology becomes available.
To counter these risks, as part of its supervisory activities Banca d’Italia has 
stepped up controls, both on financial intermediaries and on their suppliers. In 
14 D. Arnaudo and S. Marchetti, ‘Technology innovation in the Italian banking system and evolving 
risk profiles’, Banca d’Italia, Banca d’Italia, forthcoming.
15 Banca d’Italia, Supervisory Operational or Security Incident Reporting Framework - Horizontal 
Analysis 2024, June 2025.
16 The use of AI to create deepfakes or false identities is increasingly commonplace. Based on CERTFin 
data, in 2023 there were no records of cases like this, while in 2024 fake current accounts opened 
online with the help of these techniques made up 0.05 per cent of total new accounts (around 250 
cases, out of 500,000); see CERTFin’s 2025 report on security and IT fraud in banks, May 2025. 
17 Estimates for the availability of quantum computers range from 3 to 20 years, depending on the goals 
considered.  

14
particular, it has urged banks to strengthen risk management for specific risks 
linked to outsourcing. 
The implementation of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) marks 
a crucial step in this direction. The new regulatory framework requires operators 
to be fully cognizant of their supply chains and to adopt effective measures for 
preventing and managing major incidents. 
Supervisory activities have brought widespread shortcomings to light: scant 
involvement of corporate bodies, patchy IT inventories, and insufficient controls 
on access to sensitive data. Banks themselves have confirmed these weaknesses: 
around 40 per cent only expect to be fully compliant with DORA starting in 
September.18 The most problematic areas remain the management of ICT risks and 
those related to outsourcing.
4. Monetary policy in the euro area
Over the past year, inflation in the euro area has returned close to the 2 per 
cent target. This has enabled the ECB Governing Council to lower the policy rate 
eight times, bringing it to 2 per cent.
The key issue now is whether the current level of interest rates is appropriate to 
keep inflation close to the target, avoiding protracted deviations in either direction.
The restoration of price stability and the ample room for policy manoeuvre 
means that the Governing Council is now in a good place to weigh its next moves 
carefully. 
The latest Eurosystem projections suggest that inflation will decline to 1.4 per 
cent in early 2026, before returning to 2 per cent the following year. In a rapidly 
evolving and unstable global environment, this scenario is subject to a high degree 
of uncertainty.
The projections are based on assumptions about energy prices and the euro-
dollar exchange rate – two notoriously volatile variables – which the events of the 
past two weeks have already eclipsed. Geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East 
has driven oil prices beyond the levels hypothesized; at the same time, the euro has 
appreciated against the dollar by much more than was projected. 
A further, significant, source of uncertainty surrounds the tariffs that will be 
applied by the United States. The projections assume that the current measures

14 15
remain in place, ultimately shaving half a percentage point off growth in the euro 
area between 2025 and 2027, with limited effects on inflation.   
Higher tariffs and prolonged uncertainty over trade policies would have far 
more serious repercussions for growth19 and could influence inflation as well.
A marked decline in the demand for European products in the US and a re-
routing of Chinese goods towards our markets would exert downward pressure on 
prices. However, in extreme scenarios, higher trade barriers could break up global 
supply chains, driving up production costs and fuelling inflation.  
Against this background, the Governing Council reaffirmed its intention to 
maintain a flexible and pragmatic approach, making decisions on a meeting-by-
meeting basis in accordance with the available data and with their impact on the 
inflation outlook.
If downside risks to growth were to strengthen disinflationary trends, it would 
be appropriate to continue with monetary easing.
This assessment reflects the principles that were reaffirmed in the recent 
monetary policy review: the symmetry of the inflation target, the medium-term 
orientation, and the central role of interest rates in the toolbox.
The experience of the past decade – marked first by an extended period of 
very low inflation and then by major inflationary shocks – has highlighted the need 
to respond decisively to persistent deviations from the inflation target, in either 
direction, and to keep expectations firmly anchored.  
It has also confirmed the importance of flanking the baseline scenario with 
an analysis of the risks and uncertainties surrounding it, including by drawing up 
alternative scenarios. 
In confirming the central role of interest rates, the Council reiterated the 
importance of being able to deploy all the instruments used in the past: purchases 
of public and private securities, long-term refinancing operations, negative interest 
rates, and forward guidance on the monetary policy stance. While they must 
be used with discernment, these instruments can prove vital when official rates 
approach the lower bound or when dysfunctions occurred in the transmission of 
monetary policy.
19 Based on an adverse scenario developed by ECB experts, the negative impact on growth would triple 
if tariffs were brought to the levels announced by the US administration on 2 April and the EU were 
to adopt retaliatory measures.

16
Finally, the monetary policy strategy review provided an opportunity to 
think about the economic implications of the phenomena that are transforming 
production: geopolitical tensions, trade fragmentation, and the acceleration of 
innovation, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence.
These factors could raise the frequency and intensity of the shocks that impact 
inflation. Facing them will require timely analyses, rapid decision-making, and 
effective communication, also founded on alternative scenarios and sensitivity 
analyses.
5. Conclusions
The international financial landscape is undergoing a profound  transformation. 
Amid growing uncertainty about the role of the United States in the global economy, 
investors are seeking alternatives to the US dollar and to American markets, slowly 
initiating a partial rebalancing of global portfolios.
This scenario opens up new opportunities for Europe.
Opportunities that can only be seized by resolutely reviving the process of 
European integration, completing the single market and adopting common policies 
for innovation, productivity, and growth.
To this end, it is essential that the Union’s financial architecture be strengthened, 
creating the conditions to attract and retain capital. This means overcoming the 
current fragmentation of the financial system, completing the Capital Markets 
Union, and providing investors with a common risk-free asset.
It is an institutional and political challenge, but it is also a chance to reduce 
Europe’s dependence on external financial circuits and to enhance the potential of 
its economy.
The new financial world that is taking shape will be more uncertain, more 
volatile, and more competitive. Banks will increasingly have to rely on technology 
to remain efficient, profitable, and close to their customers. Artificial intelligence, 
strategic data use, and cybersecurity will be vital for competing successfully in 
the future. These trends come with a significant increase in operational risks, 
demanding the attention of both intermediaries and supervisory authorities. 
In an increasingly technological environment, human capital remains key: to 
face change effectively, banks will have to invest in people, in their skills, and in 
their ability to steer innovation.

16 17
In the coming months, monetary policy will need to stay flexible and 
pragmatic. The return of inflation to the 2 per cent target is an important step 
forward, but the outlook remains subject to multiple risks. Against this backdrop, 
it will be essential to assess the inflation outlook and the risks to price stability on 
a meeting-by-meeting basis. 
In a changing world, Europe has everything it needs to play a leading role, so 
long as it acts with determination, vision, and a spirit of unity.
