Ladies and Gentlemen, 
It is a great pleasure to be in New York and I am grateful to Thomas Philippon 
for his invitation. My theme today will be what first lessons we can learn for 
monetary policy from the surge and then decline in inflation. In the euro area, 
inflation reached 10.6% in October 2022 and exceeded 4% for two years. But 
inflation was as rapid to decline and now, at 1.7% in September 2024, stands 
very close to our target of 2%. 
Since Ben Bernanke’s speech in 2004i, there is always a debate about whether 
favourable outcomes are good luck or good policy. And this time we have had 
a dose of good fortune.  
 
As shown in Figure 1 , energy and food prices contributed to inflation 
developments both uphill and downhill. But the return of inflation to 2% and its 
speed of convergence are also due to our monetary policy. Banque de France 
estimates show n in Figure 2 suggest that HICP inflation would have been 
between 2.5% and 3% higher in 2024 without monetary tightening, in line with 
ECB estimatesii. These estimates are even conservative as they do not include 
the effect on the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.  
In taking stock of what we have learned during this episode , let me focus on 
three dimensions: monetary policy and disinflation (I); monetary policy and 
growth (II); monetary policy and its instruments (III).

I. Monetary policy and Disinflation: No magic, but a virtuous circle 
between past & present credibility, and between communication & action 
 
The relatively low cost of disinflation has not been a given. Not so long ago, 
many observers were claiming that inflation would either proved persistent 
(including in the ‘last mile’) and/or be eradicated only at the cost of a recession. 
Why were they proven wrong so far? 
 
1.1. A tale of two disinflations: contrasting economic paths 
 
Let me start with a tale of two disinflations: the great disinflation at the beginning 
of the 1980s in the US and the recent disinflation. In both cases energy prices 
contributed initially to inflation . Crucially, the consensus about the optimal 
monetary policy response to inflation was largely shaped by the 1980s ’ US 
experience and the subsequent large academic literatureiii. The end of the great 
inflation from 1980 to 1985 proved that monetary policy was a potent instrument 
to achieve price stability, but to be credible had to risk high unemployment. As 
a consequence, the post -Volcker consensus was that central banks (i) should 
react swiftly and strongly to inflation , as in the celebrated Taylor principle that 
the interest rate should respond by more than one-for-one to inflation to prevent 
uncontrollable inflation path, (ii) would need to actively increase unemployment 
to disinf late the economy, along the Phillips curve , and (iii) should be more 
independent following a seminal article by Barro and Gordon in 1983iv.

The recent fall in inflation has been more rapid and less costly in terms of growth 
and employment than in the 1980s, see Figures 3 and 4v. Why the difference? 
A convincing answer by Goodfriend and King is that most of the high 
recessionary cost of the Volcker disinflation was  due to the Fed’s “ imperfect 
credibility”vi. Much of the battle Volcker had to fight was against persistently high 
inflation expectations, a legacy of the loss of control in the 1970s. 
This time, central bank credibility led the effects of commodity shocks to prices 
“to mostly and quickly fade away” as emphasized by Bernanke and Blanchard  
(2024)vii.  
 
Figure 5 shows that inflation expectations remained broadly anchored despite 
large shocks, especially after the first rate hike. The question was not if inflation 
would converge to target but when. This credibility doesn’t come from nowhere 
but from (a) independence, (b) simple and transparen t objectives (inflation 
targeting), and (c) decisive past actions. Central banks nevertheless also had to 
‘walk the talk’. Credibility is an asset to be preserved, not an inheritance to be 
exploited. In the case of the ECB, our monetary policy responses were forceful 
and persistent: from July 2022 to September 2023, we raised our key interest 
rates by 450bps.  


Page 5 sur 13 
 
 
As shown by Bauer et al (2024)viii in the US case and apparent in Figure 6 from 
Banque de France work on the euro area ix, the market pe rception of ECB 
responsiveness – here measured as the time- varying sensitivity of expected 
rates to expected inflation at the same horizon – has always been strong (higher 
than one) at long horizons. It suggests that markets anticipate an active reaction 
function in the medium- to long-run, and this sensitivity increased during the lift-
off period from mid- 2022 to mid- 2023 at all horizons, suggesting that actions 
reinforced our credibility to fight inflation. 
 
1.2. From the vicious circle of inflation to the virtuous circle of credibility 
 
What we learned from the Volcker period is that disinflation is costly and long to 
achieve for an imperfectly credible central bank. Firms anticipating increasing 
costs are likely  to increase their prices and workers anticipating increasing 
prices fight for higher wages leading to a vicious inflation circle and creating a 
strong correlation between current  and expected inflation. Imperfectly credible 
central banks must hence react more forcefully and swiftly. The induced much 
higher real rates may however quickly cause unemployment but  without any 
immediate gains from price stability , such as  lower long -term inflation risk 
premia. 
By contrast, a (more) credible central bank faces a virtuous circle of credibility. 
Past credibility anchors inflation expectations at the target, reducing the risk of 
an inflation spiral. This reduces the size of the interest rate hikes necessary to 
bring inflation down, and the associated costs on economic activity. Quantifying 
the impact of credibility is by no means easy, and surrounded with much 


Page 6 sur 13 
 
uncertainty. But Banque de France research suggests that, had inflation 
expectations been as poorly anchored as they were in the 1970s in the US, our 
policy rates would have had to peak around 8% instead of 4%x. 
 
Credibility also buys time. When a central bank is imperfectly credible, it must 
act immediately to calm any latent inflationary pressure and continually 
demonstrate that it aims at stabilizing inflation. But a credible central bank can 
react with a delay and still achieve nominal anchoring. Indeed, Davig and Leeper 
argue that what really matters is the average reaction to inflation in the medium 
run and not the immediate response, a sort of “long-run Taylor principle”xi. Still, 
the delay should not be too long as it may be wrongly interpreted as a signal for 
future inaction.  
Central bank credibility like inflation is also global xii. M ost central banks in 
advanced economies have credible and convergent inflation numerical targets 
(2%), a distinctive difference to the 1980s. This global credibility translates into 
less, and more transitory , imported inflation and hence inflation expectations. 
When a central bank acts against inflation and reinforces its credibility it exerts 
a positive externality worldwide. 
 
II. Monetary policy and growth: A recent change in the balance of risks 
 
2.1 Till now : A pragmatic approach to monetary policy tightening 
 
Monetary policy tightening was necessary for price stability but also for 
sustainable long-term growth. However, it might in the short term have caused 
a recession or substantially increased unemployment. But it didn’t. 


Page 7 sur 13 
 
Several reasons have been put forward to explain this: transitory price shocks 
in the end, non-linearity of the Phillips curvexiii as studied by the latest WEO of 
the IMF xiv… But returning to a recurring theme,  credibility ha s reduced the 
output-inflation trade-off by anchoring medium-term inflation expectations and 
making communication about future policy reliable . The same Banque de 
France studyxv suggests that without firmly anchoring of expectations that we 
witnessed, euro area output would have been 2% lower in 2023 due to a more 
restrictive stance, while inflation would have still been above 6%. 
 
2.2 The near future  : From the risk of inflation persistence to growth 
challenges and inflation undershooting risk 
But the situation has now changed, so has the balance of risk. As you know, the 
ECB has  no dual mandate but  a primary mandate of price stability over the 
medium run. Yet, our price stability objective is symmetric, around the 2% target.  
In principle, a dual mandate and symmetric inflation target are not always 
identical because there are sometimes trade-offs between output and inflation. 
But today, there is strong convergence: in the euro area, inflation persistence is 
no longer the sole and dominant risk. Instead, there is equally the opposite risk 
that inflation undershoots, especially if growth remains subpar. In the September 
ECB staff projections, inflation was expected to fall to 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 
2026. But market -based expectations point to inflation already below 2% in 
2025; and according to the latest actual inflation data, the euro area could be at 
2% inflation already early 2025.  On the real side, our real GDP forecast was 
revised down compared to the June round. So far, we can see the expected soft 
landing, but not a further take-off. Based on this dual assessment of significant 


Page 8 sur 13 
 
downside risks on inflation as well as on growth, our Governing Council decided 
last week to lower the DFR by 25 basis points to 3.25%. 
For the near future, I plead for agile  pragmatism in the further reduction of our 
restrictive bias. Pragmatism, with full optionality for each of our future meetings, 
based on incoming data and forecasts. And a gile: we are not behind the curve 
today, but agility should prevent us from running such a risk in the future. The 
risk of reducing too late our restrictive stance could indeed become more 
significant relatively to the one of acting too quickly. On our terminal rate, it’s 
obviously too early to tell. However if we are next year sustainably at 2% 
inflation, and with still a sluggish growth outlook in Europe, there won’t be any 
reasons for our monetary policy to remain restrictive, and for our rates to be 
above the neutral rate of interest. 
When victory against inflation is in sight, monetary policy shouldn’t inflict 
excessive or prolonged restraint to activity and employment, and hence to our 
fellow citizens. This is about consistency with our secondary objectives in the 
EU Treaty.  That said, the most significant  growth challenges in Europe are 
beyond monetary policy. Low potential growth is structural, due to a lack of 
innovation, as stressed by the recent Draghi’s and Letta’s reports. Europe faces 
the joint challenges of the demographic, energy and digital transitions, in a more 
fragmented world. National g overnments and Europe as a whole must act 
urgently. 
 
III. Monetary policy and its instruments: Confirming the unconventional 
toolbox but being ready to adjust it 
 
Let me now turn to a rapid and personal reflection about our monetary policy 
toolbox, in its two main “non conventional” elements. 
 
3.1 Liquidity management and balance-sheet tools  
 
Central bank balance-sheet tools, like asset purchase programmes and LTROs 
(Figure 8), were designed in crisis times, either to preserve an effective 
monetary policy transmission when specific market segments were under strain, 

Page 9 sur 13 
 
or to ease the monetary policy stance when required and conventional tool was 
unavailable due to the Effective Lower Bound.  
 
Beyond crises times, we are for sure committed to provide adequate liquidity to 
financial institutions and markets, avoiding scarcity as demonstrated by the 
latest update of our operational framework. 
That said, the 2025 strategy review of the ECB will study the adequate use and 
limits of each balance -sheet tool in depth, but let me share with you three key 
principles that, in my view, we should keep in mind. 
First, taking interest -rate risk in our balance- sheet should be restricted to 
operations whose primary objective is to ease the stance  or protect the 
transmission by reducing the term premium and therefore long term yields. 
When the primary objective is rather to inject liquidity, it should be done by 
lending short-term or at floating rates for LTROs. These were by the way an 
interesting European innovation not used in the US.  But, the initial pricing of 
TLTRO-III at quasi -fixed rates had been a mistake, which had to be later 
recalibrated. For the same reason, in our new operational framework, our future 
structural portfolio of assets to keep money market rates close to the deposit 
facility rate could contain a significant proportion of short duration bonds.   
Second, both in our QE or structural portfolio holdings, we should prioritize 
government bonds and supranationals to limit our direct exposure to the 
nonfinancial corporate sector in our balance- sheet.  That being said, such 
programmes are not and should never be designed to fund governments nor to 
help fiscal stimulus – a widespread illusion.  


Page 10 sur 13 
 
Third and finally, one important lesson from the recent years is that we should 
not condition one instrument on another. Doing so creates communication 
issues if one programme has to be stopped rapidly. For instance, using asset 
purchases to make forward guidance more credible can happen to be unwise,  
as we could see early 2022 when we had to stop gradually asset purchases 
before being able to raise rates.  
 
3.2 Forward guidance and communication 
 
Communicating about future polic y reinforces the expectations channel of 
monetary policy.  It is sometimes viewed as binary, while, in practice,  
communication belongs to a continuum from full commitment to total silence. 
On one extreme of the spectrum, forward guidance works, in principle, through 
the commitment to depart from the standard policy. However, central bankers 
should not be unconditionally pre-committed to any interest rate path but keep 
optionality, at least, beyond few quarters. At shorter horizons, date-contingent 
forward guidance might still be validxvi. For signaling policy at longer horizons, if 
needed, state-dependent (and hence more humble) forward guidance would be 
more appropriate, as it combines optionality and effectiveness. 
At the other side of the spectrum , the central bank can give no indications 
whatsoever. With the recent inflation surge, the ECB  shifted to a meeting- by-
meeting and data-driven approach, an evolution warranted by high uncertainty 
and inflation forecast instability. Recent BdF work finds that during the inflation 
surge the  ECB reaction function became  less “inflation forecast-based” and 
more “underlying inflation data-driven’”.  
 


Page 11 sur 13 
 
But now that we are back to a “normal” inflation regime, our reaction function 
should become more “forward-looking”, with greater confidence on forecasts , 
and rely less on monthly flash data. 
Between these two sides of the spectrum , there is soft signaling, whereby the 
central bank makes clearer its reaction function. Contrary to forward guidance, 
it is not a commitment  to deviate from the standard reaction but it can still 
influence market expectations of future policy. Such soft signaling is our 
everyday life business, while the two other forms (no signaling and forward 
guidance) should be the exceptions.

So what did we learn in the end?  
First, a recession is not needed to disinflate the economy when central banks 
are credible and therefore the expectations channel is strong.  Central bank 
credibility also buys times in case of uncertainty which was helpful at the end of 
2021. However, credibility is not magic but must be sustained through action.  
Central banks cannot completely promise “immaculate disinflation” , but the 
adjustment to shocks is then smoother. 
Second, monetary policy must remain agile and pragmatic in the face of 
changing balance of risks. We have to be prepared to face any new situation by 
relying more than ever on our symmetric medium-term 2% inflation target. This 
is all the more necessary that we are facing an increasingly volatile and 
uncertain geopolitical environment as well as the demographic, climate and 
digital transitions 
Third, the recent inflation surge implicitly taught us a lot about the ex post cost-
benefits of unconventional tools that were put in place before and during the 
Covid. They proved their worth and should remain part of the toolkit but all could 
be adjusted to be more flexible and less costly. These are only few preliminary 
thoughts where the ongoing ECB strategy review will dig further. 
Central banks and monetary policy have lived their way in the last 10 years 
through an unprecedented sequence of lowflation, then almost deflation (during 

Page 12 sur 13 
 
Covid), high inflation, and successful disinflation. It’s no reason for 
complacency, but some reasons for confidence, and for further improvement to 
face the challenges of the years to come.
