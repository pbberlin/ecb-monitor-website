Presentation accompanying the speech
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my great pleasure and honour to welcome you all to the Bank of Finland's 4th 
monetary policy conference on the timely and critical topic of "Monetary policy in the 
shadow of geopolitics and trade tensions."
This is a subject of critical importance today. Politics and economics have always been 
intertwined, but now geopolitical tensions and tariff wars make up a unique set of 
challenges. The long-time anchors of economic stability-open trade, global governance, 
and predictable international relations-are under strain. In this new reality, we must 
better understand the uncertainties of the more fragmented world.
I will say a few words on central banks' strategies in this 'new normal' shortly. Let me 
first introduce today's programme and speakers.
I am especially honored to welcome our first keynote speaker, Philip Jefferson, Vice-
Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Vice-Chair Jefferson, your 
insights on these matters are invaluable, and we are eagerly anticipating your views on 
the challenges facing monetary policy today. Thank you so much for joining us.
We are likewise very much looking forward to listening to Christine Lagarde, President 
of the European Central Bank, later today. Her leadership, policy insight and stamina 
are essential as we pursue teamwork to ensure price and financial stability, thus 
supporting the foundations of sustained growth and employment in the euro area.
Today, we are also very pleased to welcome Chief Economic Advisor Reza Moghadam 
from Millennium Capital Partners. Reza is a voice of great experience – having served 
in key positions at the IMF, e.g. as European Director – and he will give us a keynote 
with case studies on different types of market reactions to geopolitics and monetary 
policy.
We are likewise most honored to have with us Professor Eric Leeper of the University of 
Virginia, who will be speaking on the fiscal foundations of inflation. This is a crucial 
topic, as fiscal and monetary policies seem to be more interconnected than ever, and 
Professor Leeper's expertise will surely challenge and inform our thinking.
After the coffee break we'll have a most interesting and topical policy panel, in which 
experienced policymakers Governor Erik Thédeen of Sveriges Riksbank, Deputy 
Governor Clare Lombardelli of the Bank of England and Deputy Governor Agnés

Benassy-Quérè of Banque de France discuss monetary policy making in times of 
uncertainty. Our board member Tuomas Välimäki will moderate the discussion.
Led by our distinguished speakers and panelists, we have today a great opportunity for 
a substantive and lively discussion, and for seeking new elements for thinking about 
sound policy decisions.
Let me now set the scene by briefly reflecting recent developments in monetary policy 
strategy.
The strategy of the European Central Bank has been reviewed and renewed twice 
during the current decade, first in 2021 and then in 2025. The 2021 strategy review was 
preceded by a long period of low inflation and of interest rates at the effective lower 
bound.
Slide 2. Old inflation target and asymmetry.
The ECB's old pre-2021 definition of price stability, "below, but close to 2%", was open 
to different interpretations. The 2% inflation was often interpreted as a ceiling.  There 
was an evident need for clarification.
Recent research by Bank of Finland economists, applying text analysis and language 
models to communication, indicates that the ECB's policy preferences were indeed 
during the first two decades of the euro, as the ECB was more averse to asymmetric 
inflation above 2% than below 2% (Haavio et al. 2024). Such asymmetry in preferences 
gave rise to in monetary policy. a disinflationary bias 
Slide 3. The ECB's 2020-21 strategy review.
That was one key reason for launching the strategy review of 2020-21. The most 
important change in the revised strategy was the introduction of a symmetric 2% 
.inflation target over the medium term
Applying the same text analysis tools to the most recent period, the BOF researchers 
have found suggestive evidence that the ECB's policy preferences have become 
after the new strategy was adopted in 2021 (Haavio et considerably more symmetric 
al. 2025).
Moreover, so-called make-up strategies, such as average inflation targeting, were dealt 
with in depth during the 2021 strategy review. In the end we didadopt a strict make- not 
up strategy, as it would have posed major analytical, policy and communication 
challenges. Yet, our strategy still contains an element that would allow compensating 
for too low inflation, if we were ever to fall back into a liquidity trap.
Slide 4. Three and a half eras of inflation in the euro area
This year's ECB strategy assessment took place after a period of high inflation, in the 
context of pervasive uncertainty. We judged that the new (2021) definition of price 
stability has served Europe well – especially considering that the 2021 review aimed at 
a strategy that works in a low inflation environment, while we were in fact hit by a

sudden upward inflation shock and a surge in inflation. Perhaps this is not so surprising, 
as any inflation targeting framework is a strategy to contain high inflation.
Hence, we took the view of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it", and decided to keep the 
definition . The clarity of the point target has helped to anchor inflation  unchanged
expectations and contribute to clear communication.
Furthermore, was reconfirmed in the 2025 Strategy  the medium-term orientation 
Assessment. It allows for temporary deviations from the 2% inflation target and thus 
gives monetary policy flexibility to "look through", if inflation varies e.g. due to temporary 
supply shocks. 
Slide 5. The 2025 Strategy assessment
However, there are also novel elements in the 2025 Strategy Assessment.  The 
updated strategy calls for ,  new ways to analyse and communicate uncertainty
especially with the help of . This is a key lesson of the shocks that  scenario analysis
have hit the euro area recently. Scenario analysis can be useful in mapping possible 
developments, outlining consistent narratives and preparing policy responses. The right 
response is always context-specific, as different uncertainties lead into different types of 
policy trade-offs. (ECB 2025)
Drawing from past experiences, the updated strategy also states that the ECB should 
react or to significant positive or negative deviations of inflation  forcefully   persistently 
from the 2% target.
Both approaches were used in the ECB hiking cycle from June/July 2022.  First, the 
ECB acted by swiftly raising the policy rate. In the second phase, it acted forcefully   
by communicating that the rate would be kept at the given elevated level persistently 
as long as necessary to curb inflation – i.e. at the 4% level from September 2023 till 
June 2024.
Likewise, in the current easing cycle since June 2024 we have acted consistently by 
bringing the policy rate from 4% to 2% in 12 months.
More generally, a policy response to significant deviations from target forceful   enables 
. Even so, there may come a point to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored
where -relying on clear communication and guidance rather than further  persistence
rate hikes-can become a more effective approach. Recent work by BOF economists 
indicates that persistence may deliver a more favourable stabilization trade-off, i.e. a 
(Ambrocio et al. 2024).lower sacrifice ratio 
Yet, these are not the only challenges confronting central banks today. Today's 
international monetary system is under pressure from both geopolitical confrontation 
and technological disruption. History reminds us that often such transitions, from the 
end of the gold standard to the collapse of Bretton Woods, have brought instability and 
inflation.
As President Christine Lagarde has said, this is truly "a global euro moment." We have 
a great opportunity to make the euro a trusted global anchor of stability. This calls for a

strategic rethink and bold action, so that it can support a healthier rebalancing of the 
global monetary order.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I cannot possibly close my intro without reference to one uninvited elephant in the room, 
i.e. the challenge to independent central banks.
Both theory and real-world experience underline the critical importance of central bank 
independence. To illustrate the point, we can compare the recent interest rate hiking 
cycle to earlier similar cycles.
Inflation did surge to uncomfortable levels in many economies. Yet central banks-
including the ECB, the Bank of England, Sveriges Riksbank, and the Federal Reserve-
were able to bring inflation down rather swiftly without inflicting severe damage on real 
activity.
While many factors played a role, research and policy experience suggest that central 
bank independence and credible inflation targets were crucial.  The recent cycle 
contrasts sharply with, say, the 1970s when inflation remained persistently high after 
the oil shocks, or the early 1980s, when the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker had 
no choice but to steer the economy into a recession to tame inflation.
Volcker truly stood tall, also physically at 6 feet 7 inches or 201 centimeters! While there 
is a little Paul Volcker in every central banker, I must say I very much prefer to tame 
inflation without imposing vast economic ramifications and social and human costs that 
were unavoidable in his era. That is precisely why central bank independence – and the 
credibility it brings – is so essential.
Welcome and thank you all again for your presence – and I hope you will find today's 
conference both stimulating and informative!
