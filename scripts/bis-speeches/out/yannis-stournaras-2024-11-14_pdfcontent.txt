Yannis Stournaras: Public debt - past lessons, future challenges
Opening address by Mr Yannis Stournaras, Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the 
International Conference on "Public Debt: Past lessons, future challenges", organised 
by the Bank of Greece, Athens, 7 November 2024.
* * *
Ladies and gentlemen,
It is my great pleasure to welcome you to this conference. As we gather today, we aim 
to address a topic of growing importance, not just for individual Member States, but also 
for our collective future – particularly for the euro area.
Historically, public debt has shaped the economic history of nations because 
governments have often resorted to borrowing to achieve economic stability and foster 
growth. While borrowing has at times allowed nations to provide critical support for their 
economies, it has also raised significant questions about sustainability, fiscal 
responsibility and intergenerational equity. As we reflect on the lessons of the past, we 
need to acknowledge the delicate balance between financing today's prosperity, on 
.the one hand, and safeguarding the well-being of future generations, on the other
In Europe, the debt crisis, which unfolded over a decade ago, tested the resilience of 
our economies, financial systems, as well as the unity – the very fabric – of the 
European Union. It exposed the vulnerabilities in our fiscal and banking systems, 
bringing to light critical lessons on fiscal policy, debt sustainability and the health of the 
banking sector due to the strong sovereign-bank nexus. Indeed, it tested the very 
existence of the single currency area.
In what follows, I will reflect on these lessons in four key areas: (1) fiscal policy, (2) debt 
sustainability, (3) financial stability and (4) the interaction between monetary and fiscal 
policy. These interconnected dimensions are not only relevant for understanding the 
past, but are also crucial for shaping the future of European economic governance.
1. Fiscal policy: The foundation of stability
Fiscal sustainability lies at the heart of any stable economy. During the European debt 
crisis, we were reminded of a fundamental truth: unchecked fiscal deficits, combined 
with large imbalances in the current account, which themselves were mostly related to 
the fiscal deficits, can trigger severe economic and financial distress. Several of our 
economies faced enormous fiscal and external sector imbalances, exposing the fragility 
of the euro area's architecture. What are the lessons that emerged?
Lesson 1: Credible fiscal frameworks.
Sound fiscal policies and strong institutional frameworks are the foundation of 
economic stability, especially in the context of the euro area, which still remains an 
incomplete economic union, lacking a central fiscal capacity. Before the crisis, the 
Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) aimed to impose fiscal discipline across the EU. 

2/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
However, its enforcement was weak, and many countries repeatedly breached the 
Pact's deficit and debt limits. The crisis underscored the importance of stricter fiscal 
and the need for .surveillance   credible enforcement mechanisms
To address these issues, the EU introduced the in 2012, mandating  Fiscal Compact 
balanced budgets and stricter oversight. The aimed to coordinate  European Semester 
fiscal and economic policies among Member States. Moreover, post-crisis reforms 
included the , which provided financial  European Stability Mechanism (ESM)
assistance to countries in distress, tying its support to strict fiscal and structural reforms. 
The ESM is an essential reform within the European economic architecture, as it acts 
as a financial backstop by providing a safety net for eurozone Member States during 
times of economic and financial distress, helping to prevent the contagious effects of 
crises and ensuring stability across the region.
Lesson 2: Countercyclical fiscal policies.
Countercyclical fiscal policies are key to stabilising economies and avoiding self-
defeating effects of fiscal consolidation, while also creating fiscal buffers. Many 
eurozone Member States were forced into procyclical austerity measures during the 
crisis, including large cuts in public investment, which exacerbated economic 
contractions and worsened unemployment. Having been Greece's Finance Minister 
during 2012-2014, I can attest first-hand to the damage Greece had to endure due to 
the imposition of overly restrictive fiscal measures. Without overlooking the political 
constraints at the time, since a milder and more gradual fiscal consolidation would have 
required a larger financing envelope, and the need to enhance market confidence by 
addressing the country's credibility gap, a more flexible approach to fiscal policy 
could have mitigated the severity of the crisis.
As we move forward, the encourage countercyclical fiscal policies,  new EU fiscal rules 
balancing fiscal responsibility with the ability to support economic growth during crises. 
This is especially relevant in today's context, where high levels of public debt persist 
after the COVID-19 pandemic. The new framework accounts for country heterogeneity 
and provides greater flexibility regarding the medium-term fiscal consolidation plans. 
Moreover, by focusing on , the new framework  structural fiscal adjustment
encourages the authorities to differentiate between temporary and permanent fiscal 
measures, thereby promoting more prudent long-term fiscal planning.
The use of the as a single operational indicator used to monitor  expenditure rule 
compliance with the new framework contributes to a more sustainable fiscal 
environment by encouraging disciplined budgeting and, thus, more effective 
expenditure-based fiscal consolidation plans. Expenditure rules mitigate fiscal risks and 
create fiscal buffers, by curbing excessive spending during periods of economic boom. 
Also, these rules allow flexibility for public investment and enhance predictability and 
market confidence in fiscal strategies.
Lesson 3: National ownership of fiscal consolidation.
The experience of the euro area debt crisis has clearly indicated that national 
ownership of fiscal adjustment efforts is critical for ensuring the success and 
. Successful fiscal consolidations depend on political sustainability of fiscal reforms

consensus and effective social dialogue. When countries take ownership of their fiscal 
policies, aligning them with domestic economic conditions and political realities, this 
strengthens their commitment to sound fiscal management. National ownership of fiscal 
consolidation plans allows governments to design tailored measures that reflect the 
specific needs of their individual economies, while fostering public support, because 
citizens are more likely to back homegrown reforms than those that are externally 
imposed.
Within the EU, where fiscal rules are in place, national ownership helps bridge the gap 
between EU-level requirements and domestic policy priorities. By embracing fiscal 
responsibility voluntarily, rather than merely complying with EU rules, Member States 
can promote fiscal discipline, improve credibility with markets and enhance trust in 
European institutions.
This approach supports long-term fiscal sustainability and economic stability, ensuring 
that fiscal consolidation efforts are both effective and politically feasible.
But let me emphasise that trust, or credibility, is not something that can be obtained 
overnight. We will have to earn it. Our new fiscal framework provides a necessary 
vehicle for doing so. The rest is up to us. As the old saying goes, "The proof of the 
pudding is in the eating."
2. Debt sustainability: A multifaceted discipline
Debt sustainability was perhaps the most immediate concern during the European debt 
crisis. The skyrocketing public debt levels in several Member States led to a loss of 
market confidence, rising borrowing costs and fears of sovereign defaults. In this 
context, the European debt crisis offered key insights into managing sovereign debt 
effectively.
Lesson 4: A holistic approach to debt sustainability.
The crisis revealed that managing public debt is not simply about medium-term 
solvency, but also about sustainability. The concept of debt sustainability  long-term 
analysis (DSA), which had traditionally focused on the medium-term evolution of the 
stock of debt, was expanded to include longer-term projections (due to the concessional 
terms of official sector loans) as well as vulnerabilities of the debt trajectory to various 
adverse macroeconomic, fiscal and financial sector shocks.
The extended analysis reinforced the notion that safeguarding a favourable 
to debt reduction is equally important as pursuing contribution of the snowball effect 
a fiscal adjustment. Moreover, medium-term projections of structural   Gross Financing 
(GFNs) are also important in identifying debt sustainability risks, because they Needs  
reflect the underlying characteristics of the public debt structure. For example, high 
levels of short-term debt or relatively high shares of floating-rate debt can make a 
country more vulnerable to interest rate shocks and high liquidity risks. Such projections 
are particularly important in detecting sustainability risks that would otherwise have 
gone unnoticed.

4/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The European institutions (EC, ESM, ECB) as well as the IMF played a central role in 
providing assistance based on DSAs, ensuring that fiscal consolidation targets the 
country's structural fiscal position (thereby promoting structural fiscal reforms, especially 
in the pension and social security systems), while also advocating for productivity-
enhancing reforms in the labour and product markets in order to raise long-term 
potential output growth.
Today, we understand that debt sustainability is not solely about reducing debt ratios, 
but also about ensuring that debt levels remain manageable under varying economic 
conditions. The new European fiscal framework is centred on a risk-based 
, which puts debt sustainability at its core and differentiates surveillance framework
among countries, taking into account their specific public debt challenges.
The incorporation of in determining the  stochastic debt sustainability analysis 
structural fiscal adjustment needs of EU Member States provides significant 
advantages because it accounts for uncertainty and incorporates a range of potential 
economic scenarios. Unlike traditional methods, stochastic DSA helps policymakers to 
assess more realistically the likelihood of various debt outcomes, identify risks earlier 
and manage debt levels proactively.
Lesson 5: Flexibility in debt servicing – Reform of the euro area debt 
restructuring framework.
Flexibility in debt servicing can help alleviate immediate fiscal pressures and prevent 
defaults. The ESM and the IMF introduced measures such as debt maturity 
and for countries receiving bailout packages. These extensions   lower interest rates 
measures provided temporary relief and helped restore market confidence.
Moreover, the overall in the euro area, shaped by the  debt restructuring framework 
experience of the European debt crisis, has evolved significantly to address more 
effectively sovereign debt challenges. In particular:
- The , which acts as a permanent crisis resolution mechanism, has the legal  ESM
mandate to restructure sovereign debt if necessary.
- Since 2013, all new euro area government bonds with maturities of more than one 
year must include . The use of CACs is a core  Collective Action Clauses (CACs)
component of the new debt restructuring framework, designed to ensure that 
restructuring can be carried out in an orderly manner, limiting market disruption.
- The ESM and the EC play a central role in conductingbefore providing financial  DSA  
assistance. The framework is used to guide decisions on the necessity and the scale of 
any potential debt restructuring.
- The experience of the Greek debt restructuring highlighted the significance of the 
in sovereign debt crises. The Greek case revealed Private Sector Involvement (PSI) 
the potential benefits and challenges of PSI, where the involvement of private creditors 
helped reduce Greece's debt burden, but the process also raised concerns about 
contagion risks.

5/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
- The euro area crisis underscored the need for orderly and predictable debt 
. Past experience has shaped principles to minimise financial market restructurings
volatility. Timely intervention is crucial, as early restructuring, if needed, is more likely to 
be successful before debt levels spiral out of control, than long, drawn-out 
restructurings.
- The has been enhanced  legal and institutional framework for debt restructuring 
to prevent moral hazard, ensuring that governments adhere to fiscal rules. The Fiscal 
Compact and the revised SGP impose stricter fiscal discipline to prevent excessive debt 
accumulation. The framework also ensures that sovereign debt restructuring is treated 
as a last resort, after all other policy measures (such as fiscal adjustment, structural 
reforms, liquidity support) have been exhausted.
All in all, following our experience, the eurozone is much better equipped to manage 
sovereign debt crises in the future. However, the need for continued vigilance, early 
intervention and fiscal prudence remains essential to ensure that sovereign debt crises 
can be prevented and, should they arise, be resolved efficiently. 
3. Financial stability: A pillar of economic resilience
The crisis also exposed vulnerabilities in Europe's . The  financial stability framework
increase in the sovereign-bank nexus created a vicious circle of contagion, where failing 
banks weakened sovereigns and vice versa.
The euro area's banking system was one of the weakest links during the debt crisis. 
Several factors accounted for this circumstance. For one thing, euro area banks 
typically hold relatively large shares of the debts issued by their respective national 
governments in their portfolios. Related to that, and in contrast to the situation in the US 
and the UK, the ECB does not have the mandate to act as a lender of last resort to 
sovereigns.
Banks in several countries, especially those exposed to housing bubbles and sovereign 
bonds, found themselves undercapitalised and struggling with high levels of non-
. The crisis in the banking sector intensified the sovereign performing loans (NPLs)
debt crisis, as governments were forced to bail out failing banks, adding to their fiscal 
burdens.
Furthermore, the crisis highlighted the importance of a well-functioning financial 
. This includes payment systems, securities settlement systems market infrastructure
and central clearing counterparties. A robust infrastructure can help mitigate systemic 
risks and ensure the smooth functioning of the financial system.
Lesson 6: Strengthening financial oversight.
A strong regulatory and supervisory framework is essential to monitor and mitigate 
systemic risks. Before the crisis, financial regulation in Europe was fragmented, with 
national authorities being responsible for supervision. This lack of coordination allowed 
financial imbalances to grow unchecked.

6/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
In response, the EU took significant steps to enhance financial supervision and 
. The creation of the and theregulation  Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)   Single 
under the Banking Union framework aimed to Resolution Mechanism (SRM) 
centralise supervision and resolution at the European level. This ensures that systemic 
banks across the eurozone are subject to uniform standards and that failing banks can 
be resolved without burdening taxpayers.
Lesson 7: Macroprudential policies.
The crisis also highlighted the need for macroprudential policies, which include 
. The ECB and the national authorities tools designed to address systemic risks
have adopted a series of macroprudential measures, such as capital buffers, to 
enhance the resilience of the banking sector, prevent the build-up of financial bubbles 
and excessive leverage, and reduce procyclicality.
Lesson 8: Bank recapitalisation and resolution frameworks.
A key takeaway from the crisis is the importance of ensuring that banks are well-
capitalised and that there are mechanisms in place to resolve failing banks without 
jeopardising financial stability. The creation of the European Banking Authority (EBA) 
and the have helped address this matter. These  Single Resolution Board (SRB) 
institutions have improved the regulatory framework and ensured that banks maintain 
sufficient capital buffers to absorb shocks. Moreover, measures to effectively manage 
credit risk were essential in order to improve the quality of the loan portfolio.
Lesson 9: Reducing the sovereign-bank nexus.
Reducing the sovereign-bank nexus is critical to preventing future crises. The European 
debt crisis has demonstrated how weak banks could exacerbate sovereign debt 
problems and vice versa. The introduction of bank resolution mechanisms under the 
ensures that shareholders and Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) 
creditors bear the losses in the event of bank failures, rather than taxpayers. This has 
helped weaken the link between banks and sovereigns, thereby decoupling risks in both 
sectors and enhancing their resilience to economic shocks.
4. Monetary-fiscal policy interactions: Complementarity of policies is critical
The interaction between monetary and fiscal policies is central to understanding how 
Europe can navigate its future debt challenges. The consistency between fiscal and 
monetary policies is critical in shaping sustainable economic recovery paths, while 
managing the delicate equilibrium between growth, inflation and fiscal sustainability.
Regardless of the near-term budget outlook, the current high levels of public debt 
complicate the task of monetary policy, limit the room for manoeuvre and worsen the 
trade-offs faced by central banks. Evidence from the recent crises in the euro area have 
underscored theneed for alignment of monetary and fiscal policy objectives,  
. Risks of highlighting the benefits of complementarity between the two policies
fiscal dominance could emerge if debt dynamics are left unchecked by the fiscal 
framework, or if fiscal policies lack countercyclicality.

7/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Lesson 10: Effective complementarity of monetary and fiscal policies.
In the current multi-crisis environment, the complementarity of monetary and fiscal 
policies is critical for achieving two interrelated goals in the European context: fiscal 
sustainability and price stability. The ECB has long emphasised the importance of 
, particularly during periods of between these two policy areascomplementarity 
economic turbulence. Moreover, over the medium-term horizon, the benefit of the 
negative interest rate-growth differential is expected to gradually fade, highlighting the 
risks of low growth and the effect of relatively higher interest rates levels (as compared 
to the pre-Covid period) on debt dynamics going forward.
Monetary policy, driven by the ECB's mandate to maintain price stability, operates most 
effectively when complemented by sound fiscal policies that ensure public debt levels 
remain sustainable over the long term. This interplay is especially important in the 
eurozone, where fiscal policy remains the responsibility of national governments, while 
monetary policy is centralised through the Eurosystem. Therefore, in the short-to-
medium-term horizon, the development of a framework to monitor and steer the 
aggregate euro area fiscal stance, including through a permanent central fiscal 
capacity of sufficient size, is important for increasing the effectiveness of 
monetary policy.
A failure to align fiscal policies with the ECB's efforts could lead to inflationary 
pressures and undermine monetary policy effectiveness, as excessive government 
borrowing risks overheating the economy or raising inflation expectations. Therefore, 
fiscal policy needs to be disciplined and forward-looking, focusing on long-term 
sustainability to allow monetary policy to maintain price stability.
*****
The European debt crisis was a wake-up call for policymakers, businesses and citizens 
across the continent. It exposed deep-rooted weaknesses in our fiscal, financial and 
banking frameworks, but it also instigated a wave of reforms that have made the 
eurozone more resilient. Further reforms aimed at strengthening the EMU, such as a 
deeper fiscal union, a complete banking union and a well-functioning capital markets 
union, can help prevent future crises and make the euro area more robust.
Today, Europe stands at a crossroads, grappling with debt burdens that have grown 
due to a series of recent crises, such as the global financial collapse of 2008, the 
sovereign debt crisis of 2010-13, the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy shock 
triggered by the war in Ukraine. Addressing debt sustainability concerns is even more 
complex within the European framework, with its unique challenges – ranging from the 
complicated eurozone economic structure and the lack of efficient fiscal coordination to 
balancing national sovereignty with collective responsibility.
How do we ensure that the consequences of today's decisions do not unfairly impact 
future generations? How do we manage debt levels without stifling growth? How can 
Europe create a framework for shared prosperity while maintaining fiscal discipline?
Over the course of today's discussions, we will try to delve into these issues from both 
historical and forward-looking perspectives, focusing on how we can learn from history 

8/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
while navigating the challenges of an uncertain future. Our goal is not just to understand 
how we got to where we are, but to contribute to the overall discussions on charting a 
responsible path for the future.
The challenges we face today – ranging from high debt levels to climate crisis, 
geopolitical risks posed by conflicts, geoeconomic fragmentation, demographic shifts, 
low productivity and deglobalisation trends – require us to remain vigilant and adaptive. 
Should we confront rising debt vulnerabilities, the need for innovative and sustainable 
fiscal solutions will be more urgent than ever.
The decisions we make today will determine not only Europe's financial stability, but 
also the well-being of future generations. Striking the right balance between fostering 
growth, ensuring fiscal sustainability and protecting the long-term interests of our 
societies is no easy task, but it is one we must face together.
Thank you all for your participation, and I look forward to the fruitful discussions.
