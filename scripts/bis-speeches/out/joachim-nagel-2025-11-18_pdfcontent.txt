1 Introduction
Mr Theurer, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and honour to welcome you 
today on this very special occasion: the Bundesbank's Financial Stability Review is 
celebrating its 20th anniversary!
We have an exciting afternoon ahead of us, with two high-calibre discussion panels. A 
warm welcome, too, to all our participants. I am delighted that you are here today to join 
in with the discussions and celebrations.
Without giving too much away at this early stage, I'd like to sketch a brief outline of the 
two panels. Our first round table will be moderated by my fellow Executive Board 
member Michael Theurer. Together, we'll look back at 20 years of the Financial Stability 
Review.
The second round table will be led by Gaston Gelos, who joins us from the Bank for 
International Settlements (BIS). He'll shift our focus forwards, exploring risks and 
challenges to financial stability now and in the years to come.
I would like to use my time at the podium to trace a broader arc, examining how 
financial stability's importance for central banks has evolved over time.
2 Central banks and financial stability 
Given that the Bundesbank's Financial Stability Review is "only" 20 years old, it might 
be tempting to think that the topic of financial stability has only recently become relevant 
to central banks. But the opposite is true: financial stability has been an important part 
of central banking from the outset, even if its significance has varied over the course of 
the years.
In the middle of the 19th century, the Bank of England began to use its rediscounting 
facility to provide the financial system with a limited amount of liquidity in crisis 
situations.1 These interventions inspired the then editor-in-chief of "The Economist" 
Walter Bagehot to pen his famous work "Lombard Street".

In his book, Bagehot recommended that the central bank should systematically 
intervene in the event of bank runs and liquidity shortages so as to preserve trust in the 
financial system and prevent a collapse. These recommendations are now known as 
the lender-of-last-resort principle.2
The US  Federal Reserve System was also founded, in 1913, as a direct response to 
repeated banking panics.3 So we can see that the link between central banks and the 
objective of financial stability is a very long-standing one. 
Midway through the 20th century, central banks began to increasingly pivot their focus 
towards safeguarding price stability and promoting growth and employment.4 Financial 
stability receded further and further into the background–not least because bank runs 
became a rarity.5 But this phase was not destined to last.
On the heels of deregulation and liberalisation of the financial system in the 1980s 
came the financial crises and turmoil of the 1990s and early 2000s. The Tequila Crisis 
in Mexico, the Asian crisis, the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge 
fund (LTCM  for short), and the implosion of the dot-com bubble were striking 
demonstrations of how vulnerable the international financial system had become. And 
how quickly financial stability can be forfeited again. 
Partly in response to this, central banks around the world started paying more attention 
to analysing and monitoring risks to financial stability once more. The introduction of 
financial stability reviews was a significant milestone. 
The Bank of England was an international pioneer, publishing its debut Financial 
Stability Review back in 1996.6 The Bundesbank published its first Financial Stability 
Review in 2005.7 Analyses on the topic had already featured in its Monthly Report in 
the two years running up to that. 
One of my predecessors, Professor Axel Weber, did an excellent job of summing up 
just how important the matter of financial stability had become: Financial stability is of 
crucial importance not only for monetary stability but also as a topic in its own right. 
Functional shortcomings in the financial system, especially owing to instabilities, can 
cause considerable economic costs.
For the first time, the Bundesbank set out exactly what it meant by financial stability, 
defining it as the financial system's ability to perform its key macroeconomic functions 
well, including in stress situations and during periods of structural adjustment.8 That 
definition, in a slightly tweaked form, stands to this day.9 From then on, the Financial 
Stability Reviews served as an early warning system for the public and as a platform for 
analysing risks. 
And at the international level, the Bank for International Settlements, too, was especially 
vocal, using its annual reports and academic studies to warn emphatically of the

dangers of excessive lending, the formation of bubbles and systemic risks.10 However, 
amid market euphoria and confidence in the financial sector's ability to self-regulate, 
these warnings often went unheeded.11
The consequences soon became apparent: the global financial crisis of 2007-08 
confronted central banks and the international financial system with unexpected 
challenges. The speed and scale of the crisis went beyond anything that had been 
feared. The highly interconnected nature of financial markets triggered chain reactions 
that led to systemic failure of historic proportions. 
In Germany, applications for stabilisation assistance totalled €231 billion, one institution 
was taken over by the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (SoFFin), and resolution 
agencies were set up.12 Gross domestic product fell by almost 6% in 2009. 
The global financial crisis becomes the catalyst for a fundamental re-anchoring of 
financial stability at the institutional level. In May 2009, the Bundesbank establishes a 
dedicated Directorate General Financial Stability. But, to start with, communicating 
information to the public through its Financial Stability Review, in the form of analyses 
and warnings, is the only device in the Bundesbank's toolkit.
That changes on 1 January 2013: the Financial Stability Act enters into force and, for 
the first time ever, bestows upon the Bundesbank–together with the Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Federal Ministry of Finance–an official mandate 
for financial stability. 
Since then, the three institutions have come together regularly in the shape of the 
German Financial Stability Committee (FSC). The Bundesbank is charged, especially, 
with monitoring and analysing developments that have a bearing on financial stability. 
The FSC  can make recommendations for the introduction of macroprudential 
instruments and activation of macroprudential measures. 
But it's not just in Germany that things have changed–the global financial crisis has led 
to far-reaching institutional adjustments at the international level, too. The Financial 
Stability Board was created in 2009 to strengthen international cooperation and the 
monitoring of systemic risks. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) set to work 
monitoring the European financial system and limiting systemic risk in 2010. 
The new Basel III regulatory framework introduced higher and better-quality capital 
requirements for banks. Furthermore, macroprudential instruments were developed to 
make the financial system more resilient. 
Nowadays, financial stability is an integral part of central banks' mandate. 
Macroprudential oversight, the analysis of systemic risks and policy consultation are 
now firmly anchored in the institutional framework. 
The financial stability reviews produced by the Bundesbank and other central banks 
have become a well-established tool–for policymakers, the financial sector and the 
general public. Central banks have–in the best sense of the phrase–gone back to their 
roots.

3 Closing remarks
At the same time, it's important to remember that the work is never done. The 
challenges to financial stability are constantly changing. The latest reports coming out 
of the United States are a clear illustration of that.
September saw both a US  auto financing provider and a manufacturer of car parts file 
USfor bankruptcy protection. In October, two  regional banks ran into difficulties due to 
fraud.13 We are following what's happening very closely–of that you can be sure!
New risks could also arise as a result of the structural change unfolding in the real 
economy and the financial system, the rapid development of artificial intelligence, and 
ongoing geopolitical developments. It is precisely these topics that we will be discussing 
in our second panel.
But, first, we want to take a closer look at how the Bundesbank's Financial Stability 
Review came to be and the challenges facing us today. I'll now hand over to my 
Executive Board colleague, Michael Theurer.
I look forward to some exciting debates and fresh ideas. Thank you very much for 
listening.
