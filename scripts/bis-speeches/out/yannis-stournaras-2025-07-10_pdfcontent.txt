Yannis Stournaras: Should central banks' mandate be revised?
Speech by Mr Yannis Stournaras, Governor of the Bank of Greece, at "Les Rencontres 
Économiques d'Aix-en-Provence 2025", panel "Should central banks' mandate be 
revised?", Aix-en-Provence, 5 July 2025. 
* * *
Good morning, everyone. Many thanks to the organisers for inviting me here today. It's 
a pleasure to be part of this distinguished panel.
Heraclitus, the Greek philosopher, famously asserted "everything changes, and nothing 
stays".
This observation is valid across all aspects of life, and central banking is no exception.
It was not that long ago when monetary policy was thought to be a policy instrument 
with limited influence, even by central bankers.
One notable central banker who held that view was Arthur Burns, who was Federal 
Reserve Chairman in the 1970s.
And so, when inflation started rising in the United States following the first oil price 
shock in the early 1970s, Burns kept his foot on the monetary-policy gas pedal.
U.S. President Nixon was facing re-election and Burns did not want to jeopardize 
Nixon's chances by allowing unemployment to rise.
Burns advocated wage-price controls – and not monetary policy – as the best way to 
prevent inflation.
What followed was the Great Inflation -- a combination of double-digit inflation and 
double-digit unemployment rates.
Not all central banks acted that way. Both the Bundesbank and the Swiss National 
Bank, to name two notable exceptions, tightened monetary policy in response to the 
1970s oil price shocks.
As a result, their economies escaped from the oil price shocks in much better condition, 
both in terms of inflation and in terms of unemployment, than that of the United States.
That experience taught central banks a lesson: monetary policy needs to focus on 
inflation if it wants to prevent stagflation – that is, a combination of high inflation and 
high unemployment.
Today, no central banker would doubt that firm resolve is needed to tame inflation, even 
if, as in the period following the Covid shock, inflation was mainly supply-driven.
Consequently, the evolution of thinking about what central banks can – and cannot – do 
has been profound during the past 50 years.

2/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
I. The evolving central bank mandate
Related to that, another significant change has been the adoption of price stability as 
the primary objective of central banks, reflecting the hard-learned lessons of the Great 
Inflation era in the 1970s, to which I just referred.
And many central banks have been granted political independence. Those two 
developments are intrinsically connected, because experience has shown that a 
politically independent central bank is best positioned to deliver price stability to its 
citizens.
The European Central Bank (ECB) is a prime example of a central bank that is both 
independent and legally bound to achieve price stability.
But the journey didn't end there. Fast forward to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). That 
profound shock revealed structural vulnerabilities in the financial system. In response, 
many central banks broadened their mandates to include explicit financial stability 
objectives.
Central banks were granted sole or co-responsibility for macroprudential tasks – 
effectively tools to prevent systemic risk.
In the euro area, this translated into a monumental institutional development: the 
creation of the banking union, entrusting the direct supervision of significant banks to 
the ECB, in close cooperation with national authorities.
This marked a pivotal step in strengthening financial stability, an important precondition 
for price stability.
More recently, the post-pandemic inflation surge and other structural shifts reignited the 
debate around inflation targets and policy frameworks.
The following question was addressed: are our current objectives, instruments, and 
operational frameworks truly fit for purpose in this highly uncertain and volatile world?
Should we revise our mandate by integrating other considerations, without 
compromising the primary objective of price stability?
II. The ECB's monetary policy strategy: a stability anchor
My focus today will be on the Eurosystem. Our price stability mandate is enshrined in 
the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. Why is this so vital? Because history has 
shown us the deep and lasting damage that can be caused by deviations from price 
stability.
How we deliver on our mandate is defined by our monetary policy strategy. Central to 
this strategy is our unambiguous and symmetric 2% inflation target over the medium 
term.

3/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The point target was made explicit in 2021. It replaced a more complex formulation, 
providing greater clarity. It offered a stable reference point that is easy for the public to 
understand, enhancing wage and price setting, thereby strengthening the anchoring of 
inflation expectations.
Since its creation in 1999 and until the shocks of the early 2020s, the ECB delivered 
inflation close to 2% on average. This helped build credibility – a precious asset. 
Thanks to this credibility, even during the recent inflation surge, long-term expectations 
remained well anchored.
That, in turn, allowed us to act forcefully to bring inflation back to target, while also 
achieving a soft landing of the economy.
You might ask: why 2% and not zero? The answer lies in flexibility. An inflation buffer 
above zero provides monetary policy with space for interest rate cuts in the event of 
adverse developments and with a safety margin against the risk of deflation. It also 
addresses issues like downward nominal rigidities and measurement bias.
Several academics and policymakers have called for raising the target above 2%. 1 
Such proposals have to be carefully weighed against potential risks to central bank 
credibility.Frequent adjustments to the target risk undermining the credibility we have 2 
worked so hard to build. If markets expect the target to keep shifting, inflation 
expectations could de-anchor, making our job much harder.
Our focus on the medium term is equally important, as it gives us valuable flexibility. 
Monetary policy acts with long and variable lags. A medium-term approach enables us 
to navigate inflationary or deflationary pressures in a stepwise, gradual manner - 
without overreacting in ways that might harm economic activity and employment. This 
approach allows us to look through short-lived supply-driven deviations of inflation from 
target, which are expected to dissipate over time.
An important strand of the literature explores monetary policy implications from 
heterogenous developments in prices across sectors. Such approaches underscore the 
critical importance of delving into granular data to help the understanding of how prices 
are changing in the economy. At the ECB, inflation analysis includes a broad range of 
measures encompassing headline and various metrics of underlying inflation, to help us 
assess the dynamics and drivers of inflation.
Our aim is to ensure that our policies are transmitted smoothly and effectively across 
member states and segments of the economy, in order to enhance the prosperity of our 
citizens. This is key in a monetary union where financial structures and economic 
conditions still differ widely.
I. Rethinking Mandates: Responding to Emerging Challenges
Let me now turn to broader challenges that call for a forward-looking reassessment of 
central bank roles.
Central banks do not operate in a vacuum. In the euro area, we must navigate a 
particularly complex environment.

4/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
This environment is shaped by fragmented capital markets, persistent geopolitical 
tensions that impact energy markets and supply chains, the urgency of climate risks, 
and a pressing need to address the productivity gap vis-à-vis other major economic 
areas.
Let me be clear: central banks are not the main actors in resolving these challenges. 
That responsibility lies primarily with governments and legislators in Europe.
However, monetary policy has a vital supporting role: to provide an anchor of stability. 
By safeguarding our primary objective – maintaining low and predictable inflation – we 
secure a fundamental condition for sustainable growth. This, in turn, fosters confidence 
among households and firms, spurring investment and job creation.
Over the past year, as inflation has eased, we have been able to largely remove policy 
restrictiveness. This easing in financing conditions will make capital more affordable 
and accessible, which is essential for investment in a time of very high uncertainty.
The ECB has also been a frontrunner in contributing to some of these broader agendas. 
Within our mandate, we are actively integrating climate-related considerations into our 
operations, risk assessments, and supervisory and collateral frameworks. In our 
strategy assessment, climate remains a policy priority within our remit.
Yet, there is something that cannot change: monetary policy cannot drive Europe's 
transformation alone.
That's why we are pressing for progress in other areas, notably financial architecture. 
Such progress can support the effectiveness of our monetary policy, a point made clear 
also in our 2025 strategy assessment.
To mobilize investment at the scale needed to re-invigorate growth and ensure that the 
benefits flow seamlessly across borders, we need to finalise the Banking Union and 
deepen the Capital Markets Union.
A fully fledged "Savings and Investments Union" is essential. It will fundamentally 
improve how our financial system channels savings into productive investment, 
especially in critical areas like energy, defence, and innovation – all pressing priorities 
for our Union.
A more integrated union will allow the euro to take on a greater role as an international 
currency. This means not only sharing in the benefits that come with that global status, 
but also stepping up to the responsibility that comes with it – especially at a time when 
the world is increasingly marked by uncertainty and division.
Europe must rise to the occasion. The ECB is working towards the digital euro, a 
project that can strengthen the international role of our currency in the digital era. This 
initiative can increase efficiency, innovation and resilience while protecting our 
monetary sovereignty.
The current institutional setup poses an important obstacle because the ECB 
essentially operates without a genuine fiscal counterpart at the euro area level. A 

5/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
permanent central fiscal capacity – a shared framework for managing public finances – 
would be a true turning point, enabling coordinated investment and shared 
responsibility for growth-enhancing initiatives.
The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) could serve as a valuable blueprint for the 
future. The creation of a common European safe asset can be a key instrument for 
deepening financial integration and resilience across the euro area. This, along with the 
elimination of internal barriers which fragment the European market as described in the 
Letta Report and in various IMF studies, and are in fact equivalent to internal high 
tariffs, will increase the rate of return on domestic investment, leading to a higher 
investment ratio as suggested by the Draghi Report, thus closing the investment and 
productivity gap with the US.
More ambitious proposals, such as the one recently put forward by Olivier Blanchard 
and Ángel Ubide,deserve consideration: they could help create a deep and liquid EU 3 
bond market that could achieve greater global significance.
V. The Fiscal and Monetary interactions
Let me elaborate more on the interplay between fiscal and monetary policy.
An enabling force to the achievement of price stability and financial stability is sound 
fiscal policy that supports monetary policy.
In the euro area, we learnt the hard way during the debt crisis that fiscal and monetary 
policies should be aligned, reinforcing each other. This could lead to more effective 
crisis resolution and stronger economic recovery, as exemplified in the handling of the 
pandemic.
The optimal outcome arises when both policies are aligned, but critically, with a clear 
understanding of their respective roles, responsibilities, and mandates.
Today, as political pressure builds in some jurisdictions to cut interest rates, 
coordination without subordination is paramount. It is critically important to maintain the 
central bank independence and ensure that policymakers can uphold their primary 
mandate of price stability.
Conclusion
To conclude, in a world of constant flux, central bank mandates are not written in stone. 
They are continuously evolving in response to significant challenges and shifting 
economic landscapes.
Yet the foundation must remain firm. A firm, credible, clear commitment to price stability.
This is our best contribution to economic growth, job creation and the welfare of our 
citizens.
A more efficient architecture of the euro area can also play a vital role.
