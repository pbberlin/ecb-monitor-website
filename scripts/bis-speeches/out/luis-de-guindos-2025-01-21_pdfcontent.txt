Luis de Guindos: The economic outlook and monetary policy in the 
euro area
Speech by Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the 
15th edition of Spain Investors Day, Madrid, 15 January 2025. 
* * *
It is a pleasure to speak here again this year.In my remarks last year, I expanded on 1 
monetary policy in the face of high inflation risks. The outlook was then still being 
shaped by the easing of pandemic-related supply constraints and by the energy price 
shock. Inflation had fallen rapidly from its peak in autumn 2022, but we needed to keep 
monetary policy sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely and sustainable return of 
inflation to our 2% target.
Today, the euro area is in a very different place. Having cut interest rates four times 
since last June, by a total of 100 basis points, we have made substantial progress in 
bringing inflation back to target. At the same time, the balance of macroeconomic risks 
has shifted from concerns about high inflation to concerns about low growth. The 
outlook is clouded by even higher uncertainty, driven by potential global trade frictions, 
macroeconomic fragmentation, geopolitical tensions and fiscal policy concerns in the 
euro area. As the new year starts, it is imperative to work towards resolving the various 
conflicts happening in the world.
Today I will outline how the Governing Council is taking this uncertainty into account in 
its assessment of the inflation and growth outlook, and how a sound financial system is 
vital in supporting monetary policy. I will then explain the rationale behind the monetary 
policy decisions that we took in December and how we will approach policy decisions 
over the coming months.
Inflation
The good news is that the disinflation process is well on track. Headline inflation came 
down quickly in 2023 from the double-digit figures we saw at the end of 2022, as the 
impact of energy and supply-side shocks faded. The decline in 2024 was more gradual 
but clearly in the right direction, with inflation averaging 2.4% over the year. The slight 
increase in inflation in December owing to energy-related base effects had been 
expected. Core inflation also declined over the past two years, falling from 5% in 2023 
to 2.8% in 2024.
Most measures of underlying inflation continue to suggest that inflation will settle near 
our 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. One of these measures, our 
Persistent and Common Component of Inflation, for example, which has the best 
predictive power for headline inflation over the one to two-year ahead horizon, has been 
around 2% for more than a year. Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services 
inflation, has edged down, but it remains high (at more than 4%) mostly because wages 
and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation with a delay. Wage 
growth has also been moderating.

The December Eurosystem staff projections expect inflation to average 2.1% in 2025 
and to return sustainably to our target rather early in the projection horizon.
Economic activity
The outlook for the euro area economy, however, remains weak and subject to 
significant uncertainty. Output grew above expectations in the third quarter of 2024. 
This was mainly driven by an increase in consumption, which partly reflect one-off 
factors that boosted tourism over the summer, and by firms building up inventories. The 
latest information suggests that the economy is losing momentum. Surveys indicate that 
manufacturing is still contracting and growth in services is slowing, as still-high energy 
prices, regulatory costs and the lagged effects of previous monetary policy tightening 
continue to bite. Firms are holding back on investments, and exports remain weak, with 
some European industries struggling to remain competitive. The labour market remains 
resilient, with employment growing in the third quarter of 2024, again by more than 
expected, and the unemployment rate remaining at its historical low of 6.3% in October. 
Overall, the December projections see growth in 2024 at 0.7%.
Looking ahead, the conditions are in place for growth to strengthen over the projection 
horizon, although less than was forecast in previous rounds. As the catching up of 
wages continues and as inflation falls, rising real wages should lead to stronger 
household spending. More affordable credit should boost consumption and investment. 
Provided trade tensions do not escalate, exports should also support the recovery as 
global demand rises. Growth is projected to be just above 1% in 2025 and to move 
slightly up to modest levels in 2026 and 2027.
Nevertheless, the risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. The risk of 
greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth by dampening exports 
and weakening the global economy. In particular, the outlook is characterised by high 
uncertainty around future trade policies in the United States, political and fiscal policy 
uncertainty in some large euro area countries as well as global geopolitical risks. In fact, 
over the past year the European Commission's uncertainty index has reached its 
highest level to date. Furthermore, with formal budget submissions from several euro 
area countries still pending, projecting the future fiscal policy stance is challenging.
This environment of very high uncertainty could dent confidence and dampen the 
recovery in consumption and investment. Such pessimismis visible, for instance, in  
consumer expectations. While real household income increased both in 2023 and 2024 
according to national accounts, only little more than a third of respondents to our latest 
Consumer Expectations Survey see their real income as having increased or at least 
stayed the same. Whereas only about 10% of households indicate an increase in 
perceived real income, in reality more than half of the households surveyed 
experienced an increase in their real income, when inflation is netted out from their self-
reported nominal income.2
Financial stability
In this volatile economic environment, we see elevated financial stability vulnerabilities.

3/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
High valuations and concentrated risks leave financial markets vulnerable to adverse 
dynamics, which could be exacerbated by non-banks. Non-bank financial intermediaries 
have remained resilient to recent bouts of market volatility, supporting market-based 
finance in the euro area. However, broader market shocks could trigger sudden 
investment fund outflows or margin calls on derivative exposures. Given relatively low 
liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some open-ended 
investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales amplifying the fall in 
asset prices. While generally limited, pockets of elevated financial and synthetic 
leverage in some entities, like hedge funds, may add to spillover risks.
Simultaneously, sovereign vulnerabilities are increasing. Despite recent reductions in 
debt-to-GDP ratios in some euro area countries, fiscal challenges persist in several 
others. They are exacerbated by heightened policy and geopolitical uncertainty and 
structural issues such as sluggish potential growth. We therefore need to keep 
monitoring risks to financial stability carefully, including those stemming from recent 
increases in sovereign yields in the United States, the United Kingdom and, though 
more moderate, in the euro area.
On a more positive note, euro area banks are strong. Their resilience has been 
underpinned by solid capital ratios, robust liquidity buffers and high bank profitability. 
The latter may have reached its peak, however, as net interest margins are already 
declining while credit losses are gradually rising.
In this uncertain macro-financial environment, preserving bank resilience remains 
crucial. Existing releasable macroprudential capital buffer requirements and adequate 
borrower-based measures should be maintained to ensure that banks can absorb any 
future shocks. At the same time, the policy framework for non-banks should be 
improved from a macroprudential perspective to strengthen the sector's resilience. 
Finally, to mitigate the current risks to sovereign debt sustainability, it is important to 
implement the EU's revised economic governance framework fully, transparently and 
without delay. Given the structural challenges related to low potential growth, the 
consolidation of public finances will need to be designed in a growth-friendly way.3
Conclusion
Let me conclude. In December we decided to further moderate the degree of monetary 
policy restriction, lowering the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision 
was based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of 
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are also 
continuing the process of balance sheet normalisation. In December the last repayment 
of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations was completed and reinvestments 
were discontinued.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our 2% medium-
term target. Given the high level of uncertainty, we will continue to follow a data-
dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary 
policy stance. The high level of uncertainty calls for prudence. In particular, severe 
global trade frictions could increase the fragmentation of the world economy, 
uncertainty about fiscal policy and its present challenges could weigh on borrowing

costs, and renewed geopolitical tensions could affect energy prices. We are therefore 
not pre-committing to a particular rate path. If the incoming data confirm our baseline, 
the policy trajectory is clear, and we expect to continue to further reduce the 
restrictiveness of monetary policy.
