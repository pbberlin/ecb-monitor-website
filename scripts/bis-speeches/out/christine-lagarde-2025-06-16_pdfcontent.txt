Christine Lagarde: Stemming the tide - safeguarding our ocean and 
economy
Speech by Ms Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, at the Blue 
Economy and Finance Forum, Monaco, 7 June 2025.
* * *
It is a pleasure to speak at the Blue Economy and Finance Forum.
In his 1857 poem "Man and the Sea", Charles Baudelaire explored the deep kinship 
between the ocean and humanity.For Baudelaire, they were two forces drawn 1 
together by awe, fascination, and even conflict.
Today, that dynamic has taken on a new and troubling dimension. We rely on the ocean 
for climate stability and economic prosperity, yet we are fuelling a climate crisis that 
threatens to undermine the very system we depend on. We cannot let that happen.
Baudelaire described the sea as a "mirror" to the human soul. We now need to take a 
hard look in that mirror and ask ourselves: what can we do to stem the tide of this crisis, 
to safeguard our ocean and economy?
This morning's two panel discussions will go a long way towards answering that 
question. But I would like to take this opportunity to open the plenary session with a few 
thoughts – about what is at stake, and what stakeholders can do about it.
The ocean's importance for our climate and economy
The ocean is home to 95% of the planet's biosphere.It spans environments as varied 2 
as sunlit coral reefs and pitch-black abyssal plains. And it supports an immense range 
of life, from countless microscopic organisms to the world's largest animal, the blue 
whale.
Given the ocean's richness, it is worth preserving in its own right. But its value does not 
end there – the ocean also benefits humanity in two vital ways.
First, it is one of the planet's most powerful allies in the fight against climate change.
The ocean helps to regulate global temperatures by absorbing vast amounts of heat 
and redistributing it through major currents like the Gulf Stream. It is also the world's 
largest carbon sink, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and 
helping to slow global warming.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that the ocean has absorbed 
over 90% of the excess heat trapped in the earth's system, as well as a third of the 
carbon dioxide that humans have emitted since the Industrial Revolution.3
Second, a sustainable ocean serves as an important pillar supporting the global 
economy, providing for food security and economic opportunities.

Marine ecosystems support over three billion people who rely on fish for at least 20% of 
their animal protein intake. Indeed, this dependency is more pronounced in some of the 
least-developed countries, where seafood provides most of the animal protein 
consumed.4
These ecosystems also help sustain employment opportunities. More than 150 million 
jobs depend on the production, trade and consumption of ocean-based goods and 
services, according to the United Nations.The ocean is also home to key natural 5 
resources, such as medicines and biofuels, which are vital for ongoing advances in 
healthcare and clean energy sectors.
So, there is a great deal at stake in preserving the ocean's health.
The threat of climate change
But today we are placing the sustainability of our ocean under extraordinary stress, with 
serious implications for both our climate and economy.
Without the ocean's capacity to absorb heat and carbon, we would have had to contend 
with a faster, even more dangerous pace of global warming. Yet there are now signs 
that this capacity is becoming strained.
The last ten years were the ocean's warmest on record. Warmer oceans are driving 
more frequent marine heatwaves, which damage ecosystems, and have been a major 
contributor to rising sea levels due to the thermal expansion of seawater. The rate at 
which the global mean sea level is rising has more than doubled over the past three 
decades.6
On top of this, the ocean's absorption of carbon dioxide is driving acidification.
Combined with ocean warming, acidification is contributing to the bleaching and death 
of coral reefs, which are vital for supporting fisheries and protecting coastlines from 
storms. Since 2023 over 80% of the world's coral reefs have been affected by bleaching.
7
We find ourselves in dangerous waters. Together, these changes could have profound 
consequences for the global economy.
Food security may be undermined, potentially leading to more volatile prices, which is a 
concern for central banks tasked with safeguarding price stability. And if coastal areas 
become unliveable due to rising sea levels or frequent flooding, people may be forced 
to move. More than 600 million people around the world live in coastal areas that are 
less than ten metres above sea level.8
Stemming the tide

3/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
So, what can we do to stem the tide of these troubling developments? We may not be 
able to fully reverse the damage done, but we can work towards slowing its momentum, 
potentially even stopping it, by acting on two important fronts.
First, we need to protect. That means cutting greenhouse gas emissions decisively and 
keeping the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach.
If we succeed in doing so, we could limit sea level rise to around half a metre by the 
end of the century. That might not sound reassuring. But every tenth of a degree we 
avoid is a piece of coastline preserved, a reef protected or a storm surge weakened.
We also need to protect the natural systems that shield us from floods. Nature-based 
solutions – for instance, restoring mangroves, marshes and coral reefs – offer powerful, 
cost-effective defences against extreme weather. Coral reefs alone can reduce wave 
energy by an average of 97% while supporting fisheries, tourism and coastal livelihoods.
9
The second front is just as important: we need to prepare.
Whether we like it or not, climate-related risks are materialising. We need to adapt our 
infrastructure and economies to a more volatile world. That includes building sea walls 
and surge barriers and budgeting for resilience rather than reacting after disaster strikes.
Make no mistake: adaptation will be costly. According to UN assessments, costs could 
run into the hundreds of billions of dollars globally each year by mid-century.But the 10 
cost of inaction would be far higher. One study estimates that failing to keep global 
temperatures below two degrees above pre-industrial levels could lead to USD 14 
trillion in global annual flood costs by 2100.11
To meet this challenge, we need to catalyse finance for marine and coastal 
conservation – for instance, through innovative approaches that convert natural capital 
into financial capital.12
This can be especially impactful for vulnerable countries with limited fiscal space. 
Above all, we must listen to the communities affected, treating their needs as a basis for 
our actions rather than an afterthought.
Let me conclude.
Baudelaire reminds us that the sea is a mirror of our own nature, which can either heal 
or harm.
So, let us choose to heal. That means nurturing the ocean's rich diversity and 
facilitating finance to support innovative adaptation measures that build more resilient 
communities and a stronger global economy.
Thank you.
