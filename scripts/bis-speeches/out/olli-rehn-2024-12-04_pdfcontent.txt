Accompanying  of the speechpresentation
Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Let me warmly welcome you to this traditional lunch event at the Bank of Finland. It is 
an honour and pleasure to meet with you today, at the start of the week that culminates 
to the Finnish Independence Day. As EU Heads of Mission, your role is pivotal in 
helping shape our collective future, and I am grateful for the opportunity to engage with 
you.
Today, I would like to share my views on how the current geopolitical climate is 
influencing our economy. I will focus on three key channels. First, the impact of 
geopolitics on trade. Second, on finance, and hence monetary policy. And finally, on 
competitiveness and productivity.
The underlying message you may detect throughout my speech is that we need unity 
and agility in Europe to stay relevant in the world – a world characterised by heightened 
geopolitical tensions.
Slide 2. Global geopolitical tensions remain elevated
Currently, we find ourselves amid a tense and dangerous geopolitical landscape, 
marked by multiple simultaneous conflicts and crises – a polycrisis – which have 
ramifications on Europe and beyond.
Global geopolitical tensions remain elevated, as shown by the Geopolitical Risk Index – 
and as we all know from our daily news flow.
Slide 3. Geopolitics is overshadowing economic developments
Looking at the global landscape, the rise in geopolitical tensions is especially due to 
Russia's illegal and brutal war in Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East, and China's 
strategic ambitions as a technological and military big power. These developments 
have profound implications for Europe, including for our economic outlook and policy.
As we move forward, the key to successfully navigating these global challenges lies in 
the effective cooperation between the United States and the European Union, together 
with our international partners in the global geopolitical arena. As autocracies like 
Russia and China are forcibly challenging the rules-based international order, we need 

2/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
to defend the value system of liberal democracy against these systemic rivals that 
advocate alternative governance models. It is therefore essential that we prioritize 
cooperation, dialogue and diplomacy.
Given the multitude of conflicts – both large and small – around the world, the last thing 
we would need is another trade war, particularly between the allies, the European 
Union and the United States. The incoming US administration comes to town with a 
hawkish trade policy. Maintaining a stable trade relationship between the EU and the 
US – for sure not easy – should be a top priority for policymakers. Seldom have trade 
and security policies been as interlinked as today in Europe.
Simultaneously, we must prepare for possibly turbulent trade relations with the US. 
Europe cannot face such a scenario unprepared, as in 2018. This calls for agility and 
clear strategic thinking in our decision-making processes. What is also vital during 
these turbulent times, is the unity of Europe. The European Commission has both the 
chance and duty to demonstrate strong leadership within Europe now. This unity is 
supported by the Community method in the field of trade policy.
While messages on future US trade policy somewhat fluctuate, we need to prepare 
ourselves for a situation where the EU is threatened by higher tariffs and other trade 
measures from the US. Clearly, a trade conflict harms the economy. In a cycle of 
retaliation, no one is a winner. Hence, a negotiated solution is preferable, but evidently 
our negotiation position needs to be reinforced by credible potential countermeasures.
In this connection, it is worth noting that it is almost certain that European imports of 
American weapons and LNG continue to rise in the coming years, as the European 
countries increase their defence spending and bolster their energy security. This can be 
one part of a positive solution for the potential trade negotiations, though Europe must 
avoid again creating unsustainable dependencies.
The war in Ukraine has made it necessary to strengthen the EU as a strategic entity, 
although the transatlantic axis remains an anchor stability for Europe. The economic 
sanctions by the EU and the US have weakened Russia's capacity to achieve its 
imperial goals in Ukraine, but we must not underestimate its continued capacity to wage 
the war. Consequently, we experience critical weeks and months of uncertainty. And we 
must prepare our economies and societies to cope with the gathering storm during this 
winter.
Slide 4. EU free trade agreements in 2024: status report
Due to the prevailing uncertainty about the US trade policy, Europe should now invest 
ever more effort in further developing trade relations with the rest of the world, not least 
with the emerging and developing economies of the so-called Global South.
The starting point is solid: we have free trade agreements (FTAs) in place with 74 
countries worldwide, covering over 44% of our external trade. These countries include 
major economies, such as Japan, South Korea and Canada. These FTAs provide 
market access to businesses, reduce tariffs and promote trade relationships. Moreover, 
FTAs with Australia, India ja Indonesia are currently being negotiated.

3/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Right now, we have the choice to conclude the ratification of the Mercosur FTA, which 
has been pending for years. This should happen before countries like Brazil turn to 
China, which would not be in our interest. Latin American democracies are natural 
partners for Europe, and trade agreements that can strengthen this partnership should 
be seen as a strategic priority and a geopolitical necessity. The credibility of the EU as 
a negotiating partners is also at stake.
Globally, trade is in transformation. Protectionism, trade wars and geoeconomic 
fragmentation in general are the by-products of geopolitical tensions. The pandemic 
further accelerated the diversion of global supply chains. These developments are likely 
to increase economic shocks and inflation volatility, and so these are critical issues that 
central bankers must closely monitor.
We are indeed witnessing some signs of trade fragmentation, primarily in two significant 
ways. Firstly, bilateral trade between the US and China has diminished and some 
supply chains have been relocated from China to Southeast Asia, Mexico and emerging 
economies in Europe, for instance. These shifts aim to mitigate supply chain disruption 
risks and avoid import tariffs or export restrictions. Secondly, Russia's war in Ukraine 
has effectively isolated Russia from the European Union, the G7 countries and their 
allies. This has resulted in a dramatic reduction in trade between the EU and Russia 
since February 2022.
Furthermore, China and India are challenging some measures adopted by the EU and 
the US, like the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, the Deforestation Act and the 
US IRA subsidies as "unilateral trade measures" and barriers to trade.
Slide 5. Domestic value added has decreased in the EU
In this complex environment, it is useful to examine whether production is being 
reshored  transferred back home  at significant levels. In other words, is globalization 
truly reversing?
Our staff analysis of the origins of value added in manufacturing indicates that in the 
United States, the share of domestically produced value added increased between 
2018 and 2023. Conversely, in the EU, there was a decrease in domestic value added. 
This suggests some reshoring dynamics in the US and the opposite in Europe. The fact 
that domestic value added has decreased in the EU may reflect our industry's muted 
competitiveness, which we will discuss later on.
Slide 6. Chinese value added has increased in the EU and remains 
unchanged in the US
Our findings also highlight the challenges of decoupling or de-risking from China, due to 
the deeply integrated nature of global production networks. Even though direct trade 
between China and the United States shows signs of a modest decline, the share of 
Chinese value added in US manufacturing imports remained stable during the period 
examined. It appears that value chains are simply being re-routed through connector 
countries like Mexico and Vietnam.

4/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
In the European Union, Chinese value added in manufacturing has in fact increased 
since 2018. While complete decoupling from China is virtually impossible, this clearly 
emphasizes the need for Europe for a stronger de-risking strategy.
While there is some evidence of shifting global trade flows, nearshoring and reshoring, 
there is currently no comprehensive indication that globalization is reversing. Obviously, 
this may change, perhaps even relatively soon, if the incoming Trump administration 
intends to keep its promises of significantly higher tariffs. In any case, the implications 
of these trends for growth, productivity and the monetary policy environment remain 
uncertain and warrant careful consideration.
Slide 7. Monetary policy has been rather effective in reducing inflation
Geopolitical tensions are not only impacting global trade flows but also finance, and 
hence monetary policy. Recent years have served as a testing ground for how a 
geopolitical polycrisis impacts inflation dynamics and the corresponding monetary policy 
responses. Overall, the European Central Bank's monetary policy has been rather 
effective in bringing inflation under control. Interest rate hikes in 2022–2023 were 
necessary in anchoring inflation expectations at the 2% target level.
While inflation has declined significantly and is now stabilizing to our target, the euro 
area has managed to sustain positive growth, and employment levels have remained 
robust. However, growth remains sluggish, and the economic outlook has deteriorated 
in recent months.
Given the current inflation and growth outlook, and considering that monetary policy 
remains restrictive, the trajectory for interest rates is clear: downward. The pace and 
scale of future rate cuts will depend on the ECB Governing Council's comprehensive 
assessment of three key factors: the headline inflation rate, the dynamics of underlying 
inflation, and the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission.
Provided that incoming data and new macroeconomic projections confirm the current 
inflation and growth outlook, there is reason to continue rate cuts at the December 
meeting of the Governing Council.
Slide 8. Reflections on the ECB's strategy review in 2025
Looking beyond December, the ECB's ongoing strategy review, which is due for 
completion in 2025, provides an opportunity to analyse the changing geopolitical 
landscape. While there is no need to change the symmetric inflation target of 2% over 
the medium term – it has worked well – we need to better understand inflation dynamics 
going forward.
Elevated geopolitical tensions can lead to financial market volatility and impact the 
pricing of risk and the cost of financing. Global trends are reflected in the level of the 
long-term natural rate of interest, r*; that is, the equilibrium rate. Some argue it is rising 
due to significant investment needs for the green transition, artificial intelligence and 
defence spending. Meanwhile, others believe the natural rate is declining due to weak 
productivity growth, ageing populations and geoeconomic fragmentation. The true 

5/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
trajectory of the natural rate remains unclear and requires deeper analysis and 
continued research.
Slide 9. Market forces expect the ECB to continue to rate cuts
Current market expectations, illustrated on this slide, are that the ECB policy rate will 
fall slightly below 2% by summer 2025.
There has been some discussion lately about a return to forward guidance. Such 
discussion is natural in the context of the strategy review. In my view, forward guidance 
should remain part of our toolbox, and it works best when we need to address the well-
known problems of the effective/zero lower bound and excessively low inflation.
But in the prevailing conditions of high uncertainty and imperfect information, it is better 
to avoid such forward guidance that ties policymakers' hands. That said, as we are 
gradually moving from the backward-looking into forward-looking approach, as Philip 
Lane explained in the FT this morning, directional guidance makes sense – as long as 
we remember to emphasise that decision-making is indeed dependent on economic 
and financial data and on the analysis of the growth and inflation dynamics and the long-
term trends in them.  
So, the direction for now is clear and, in my view, we will be moving from the restrictive 
territory towards a neutral level of policy rates in the course of the coming springwinter. 
And as we all (should) know, in Finland this can mean anything between January and 
June.
Slide 10. Europe must find ways to increase productivity
After looking at the impact of geopolitics on trade and finance, we should turn our 
glance to the Achilles heel of Europe: the marked slowdown in our productivity growth. 
While the entire manufacturing sector in Europe seems to be characterized by 
prolonged underperformance, which points to structural problems, the current 
geopolitical landscape is putting additional pressure on industrial competitiveness.
In that context, European industry must strengthen its technological capabilities. Cutting-
edge research and innovation, and of course investment, particularly in areas like AI, 
will be crucial for maintaining Europe's relevance on the global stage. And we need to 
address the price of energy as a key hindrance to Europe's competitiveness. Unlike the 
US, Europe has no abundant fossil fuel supplies, so there is no other strategy for 
increasing our energy security than decarbonization.
Global uncertainty and geopolitical challenges demand agile decision-making. We need 
to streamline decision-making processes and reduce bureaucratic red tape, which will 
empower us to act more decisively. This would also help improve Europe's industrial 
competitiveness and productivity growth, as underlined in the Draghi report.
Slide 11 Summing up
Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,

6/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
In conclusion, the rise in geopolitical tensions is contributing to an increasingly 
uncertain and volatile global environment. This has significant implications for economic 
policy in Europe and beyond.
First, a new trade war would most definitely be unwelcome amid today's geopolitical 
rivalries – especially among allies. If a trade war were to start, Europe must not be 
unprepared for it, as it was in 2018.
The evolving geopolitical landscape, along with other long-term trends, will shape global 
financial markets and the monetary policy environment, and we must carefully consider 
all these shifts as we review and develop the ECB's monetary policy strategy.
Moreover, reinforcing the structural foundations of the European economy – productivity 
growth and industrial competitiveness – is paramount to maintaining a key role for 
Europe in the future.
The Eurosystem will, within its mandate, continue to act as an anchor for economic and 
financial stability in this landscape of great challenges. No one should doubt that we will 
shoulder this responsibility in full.
Thank you for your attention! I am looking forward to your questions and to what 
promises to be an engaging discussion.
