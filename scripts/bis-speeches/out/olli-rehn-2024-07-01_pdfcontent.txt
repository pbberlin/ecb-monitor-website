Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,
It is my great pleasure to welcome all of you to the Bank of Finland's conference on 
monetary policy in low and high inflation environments, and especially those of you who 
have travelled from further afield to be here in Helsinki. I am more than delighted to 
welcome our distinguished speakers and participants from different continents, and very 
much looking forward to an inspiring exchange of views today.
In my opening remarks, I will first talk about the exceptional price dynamics over the 
past crisis years, and then provide some personal reflections on the ECB's upcoming 
monetary policy strategy review.
To set the stage, let me illustrate the brief history of inflation in the euro area by dividing 
the last quarter century of the euro into three periods.
SLIDE 2. Three periods of inflation in the euro era, 1999–2024
These are, on average: 1) at around 2% during the waning great moderation in 1999-
2009; 2) slightly above 1% during the post-financial crisis below-target inflation in 2009–
21; and 3) above 6% during the years of accelerating inflation since 2021. Each of 
these periods had a specific set of inflation (or deflation!) drivers and price stability 
anchors, and thus specific price dynamics and specific policy issues.
The common feature in the advanced economies is that inflation has been mostly due 
to supply disruptions and sharp increases in the prices of food and energy, as 
concluded by Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard in their recent paper. On the other i
hand, over time inflation became more broad-based and stickier, leading to higher wage 
inflation on a tight labour market. Fiscal policy also played a role in fuelling demand-
side inflation, especially in the United States. 
While we have seen some less convincing data on inflation recently, in a moving 
context, we must see the forest for the trees. Considerable progress has been made in 
bringing inflation down towards the ECB's symmetric 2% target, especially since 
September 2023. Monetary policy and financing conditions have been held tight to curb 
demand, which has helped keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored.
SLIDE 3. Monetary policy anchored inflation expectations at 2%

2/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Overall, the dynamics of inflation continue to indicate that inflation will stabilise at the 
target in the medium term, even though its downward path has slowed somewhat in 
recent months. This will strengthen the real purchasing power of euro area households.
We always knew that it will be a bumpy road, but the ECB Governing Council is 
determined to ensure that inflation stabilizes to the 2% medium-term target in a timely 
manner. In the decision-making we will continue to focus on three factors: the inflation 
outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy 
transmission.
SLIDE 4. Reflections on the ECB's next strategy review in 2025 
In keeping with the title of this conference – Monetary Policy in Low and High Inflation 
Environments – as  promised I will next provide some personal reflections on the ECB's 
upcoming monetary policy strategy review, having actively participated in the previous 
2020–2021 review.
Prior to the 2021 review, we had had a long period – almost a decade – of exceptionally 
low inflation. But now, of course, the situation has changed considerably, as we have 
experienced exceptionally high inflation in the past couple of years or so.
In the 2021 strategy review, we reviewed the previous asymmetric target, "below but 
close to 2 percent", and replaced it with a symmetric 2% target. Symmetric in the sense 
that, as we stated, both negative and positive deviations from the target are regarded 
as equally undesirable. And we underlined the medium-term orientation for reaching the 
target.
In my view, the symmetric, medium-term 2% inflation target has served us well, so far: it 
has provided a clear and comprehensible anchor, and enough flexibility both in terms of 
the temporal definition and the instruments used. This has allowed us to avoid taking 
any excessively drastic measures that the old target might have implied.
The inflation itself does not then, in my view, need re-consideration. But we need  target 
to analyze inflation in the exceptional years – and the functioning of the  dynamics  
strategy – in more depth.
It is worth recalling that at the time we published our revised symmetric 2% inflation 
target in July 2021, the operating environment for monetary policy was in considerable 
flux.
First, the COVID-19 pandemic threatened to lead to a major depression and was 
countered by a quick and strong response of monetary and fiscal policies. Then we saw 
supply-side bottlenecks and accelerating inflation. And in February 2022, Russia 
launched its illegal war in Ukraine. The energy crisis caused by the war hit the 
European economy hard. The euro area's imported energy bill increased in 2022 by 
€400 billion, i.e. by around 3–4% of GDP. This meant a substantial and possibly long-
lasting cut in the average European's standard of living.

3/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
At that point, the combination of stagnant growth and accelerating inflation was a 
completely credible prospect. On the one hand, the sharp rise in energy prices 
accelerated inflation. And on the other, the substantial increase in geopolitical 
uncertainty and the ending of energy imports and trade with Russia seemed destined to 
undermine Europe's economic recovery. Monetary policy was thus facing a major 
dilemma.
After a period of deliberation from March until June, the ECB began, in July 2022, a 
series of policy rate increases that wasexceptionally rapid and consistent– due to the     
exceptionally high inflation rate. In line with our revised strategy, our goal was to tame 
inflation over the medium term by preventing a wage-price spiral and thus keeping 
inflation expectations anchored.
In my view, this goal has been, by and large, achieved (see graph). Our symmetric 2% 
inflation target and the medium-term orientation of monetary policy have made a soft 
landing possible: economic growth has been somewhat subdued as a result of the rise 
in interest rates, but the risk of a persistent economic crisis has been avoided, and 
inflation has been stabilized over a period of 2–3 years (knock on wood).
Some have argued that we did not hit the brakes early enough. Let me say that many of 
us policymakers would in fact have been ready to raise rates already in March 2022 in 
the face of soaring inflation, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine brought a return to the era 
of brutal geopolitics and created amassive cloud of uncertaintyover Europe's economy.   
My initial feeling – even in retrospect, a completely rational one – was that it would 
probably have serious stagflationary consequences, hitting growth and generating 
inflation, a kind of "back to the 70s". In that context, it made complete sense to pause 
for a minute and wait for the clouds to clear before choosing the policy stance. This is 
something worth remembering in all of the recent polycrisis years. post-mortems 
This links very much to the ECB's upcoming strategy review. Given our primary 
mandate, the focus of the review should, in my view, be on achieving a better 
understanding of the inflation dynamics of the past few years, and of the secular trends 
that keep changing the operating environment of monetary policy going forward.
To begin with, it is essential to analyze the large and persistentshocks that the  supply 
euro area has encountered in recent years. But we must also have an open debate on 
the role of shocks, including monetary and fiscal policies. The jury is still out  demand  
concerning the relative importance of their contribution to the period of high inflation.
By the way, the same goes for the period ofinflation: did we come out of the  low 
liquidity trap as a result of our own policy actions, or was it due to the pandemic-related 
supply shocks and strong fiscal stimulus?
A further key question is whether we should react to supply shocks in a different way 
than in the past few years. To what extent can we, as a central bank, even influence 
supply-side issues? I think a good approach is to follow the established wisdom of 
monitoring the extent to which supply shocks causesecond round effects. 

4/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Turning to secular trends, one thing that has fundamentally changed since our last 
strategy review is thegeopolitical landscape. 
Geopolitics will continue to shape the operating environment of monetary policy in the 
years ahead. The changes that are taking place in the world economy, from trade wars 
to supply chain diversions, are likely to increase the probability of supply shocks and 
inflation volatility. But geopolitics, and especially the ongoing geo-economic 
fragmentation, may also have a strong impact on the new equilibrium that emerges 
once the current interest rate cycle is completed.
And this brings us to the question of the level of the long-term real natural rate of 
interest, r* or the equilibrium interest rate. This has been much discussed among 
central bankers, including at the BIS and IMF.
SLIDE 5. Natural interest rate is a necessary analytical framework
The chart shows various estimates of the natural rate for the euro area. According to 
recent studies, it is typically estimated to be somewhere between 0% and 1% in real 
terms in the euro area.ii
I, for one, don't think of the natural interest rate as a certain exact number, nor as a 
viable concrete tool for monetary policy, but instead as an illustrative and  devising 
even necessary analytical framework for monetary policy. thinking about 
And I venture to say that it matters to policy outcomes what frameworks policymakers 
use: whether it is, say, the quantity theory of money, the monetarist explanation of 
inflation, the linear versus non-linear Phillips curve, or animal spirits and inflation 
expectations – just to name a few. My own view, as I implied, is that the natural rate has 
to be at the heart of modern monetary policy analysis.
In recent years, some have argued that r* has risen. Spurring this rise, it is argued, are 
the increase in investment needs due to the green energy transition, and also artificial 
intelligence and growing defence spending. On the other hand, population ageing and 
the deterioration in the global division of labour caused by geopolitics could weaken the 
dynamics of the economy and productivity growth, and thus also negatively affect the 
pace of investment. This would contribute to keeping real interest rates down. So, the 
trajectory of r* remains unclear for now – that's why we need to continue and dig 
deeper.
SLIDE 6. Hours worked and persons in employment
Another focus of analysis should be thelabour market,not least since it is closely linked    
to the apparent slowdown in productivity growth.
In recent years, euro area employment growth has been robust, and the unemployment 
rate is at a historical low of 6.4%. However,the number of hours workedhas increased    
at a significantly lower rate thanthe number of people in employment. This means that  
the euro area labour market – when measured as hours worked – has not developed 
particularly favourably, and correspondingly, productivity growth looks somewhat better 
when measured per hour.

5/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
We also need to gain a better understanding of how demographics affect the labour 
force participation rate and the development of the labour force in the future.
During the past few years, we have seenlarge and exceptional shocks originating from  
the labour market. In addition to the sharp decrease in average hours that led to an 
increase in the demand for labour, has increased labour supply and  immigration 
helped to constrain wage pressure. Taking these shocks into account makes the 
developments in the labour market of the past few years look much less mysterious 
than is often claimed. Understanding what happens in the labour market is crucial for 
understanding wage and inflation dynamics in the future.
Currently wage increases in the euro area are driven by both compensation for past 
inflation surprises and still relatively strong labour demand (from the services sector). At 
the same time, inflation expectations have remained well anchored, and we see little or 
no wage impact from inflation expectations.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This brings me to the end of my opening remarks.
Uncertainties and the exceptional price dynamics have challenged our policymaking in 
the past few years. The silver lining is that we have gained a lot of understanding about 
the appropriate policy responses in these circumstances. This understanding should be 
pooled and deepened in the upcoming ECB strategy review.
For me, the experiences of recent years have, above all, highlighted the crucial role of 
inflation expectations in the making of monetary policy. Likewise, they have 
underscored the importance of a firm commitment to a medium-term inflation target in 
line with our strategy.
Going forward, the monetary policy strategy should be designed in a way that is robust 
in the face of uncertainty about the future state of the world. It should be flexible enough 
to work well in different environments and react to new and unknown shocks. Thus, 
while we have made major advances in the science of economics relevant for monetary 
policy, there still is room for judgement; that is, for the art of monetary policy.
Last but not least, let me wish you an enjoyable and analytically rewarding conference! 
Thank you.
