Klaas Knot: Presentation of the 2024 annual report
Introductory remarks by Mr Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank, at the 
presentation of the 2024 annual report, Amsterdam, 20 March 2025.

Good morning and welcome to our fully renovated headquarters building.
Here you see the result of five years of hard work. I am very happy that the building 
turned out so well and that the renovation project stayed within budget and was 
completed on schedule. And all that despite the pandemic. King Willem-Alexander will 
conduct the official opening next week, and visitors are already finding their way to De 
. Everyone is welcome to come visit us.Nieuwe Schatkamer
This is the fourteenth time I have had the honour of presenting the DNB annual report. 
And this is also my last time. For on 1 July, my second term as President will come to 
an end, and with a heavy heart I will say goodbye.
As this is my last annual report, my introductory chapter also looks back over the past 
14 years, including at the monetary policy we have conducted. A lot has happened in 
those 14 years, with one constant: events outside the Netherlands have always had a 
huge impact on the Netherlands itself.
Today this is perhaps more true than ever. A war has been raging in Europe for several 
years, and it is unclear whether it can be brought to a lasting and just end. At the same 
time, the post-war Atlantic security situation seems to have been thrown out of balance 
due to tensions between the United States and Europe, leading to a need in Europe to 
invest heavily in defence to ensure our security.
Against this geopolitical backdrop, far-reaching trade conflicts between the major 
economic trading blocs are looming. And we are also faced with various long-standing 
vulnerabilities relating to domestic economic tightness, inflation and sluggish European 
growth. These vulnerabilities are being exposed and exacerbated by the situation in the 
world today.
Following the pandemic and the energy crisis, we are now witnessing the world being 
turned upside down for the third time. So much so, that, to quote Pope Francis, this no 
longer feels like an era of change, but a change of era.
So there are big challenges ahead. Perhaps the two most urgent are the looming trade 
tariffs and the ambition to rapidly ramp up our defence spending. Trade tariffs disrupt 
global trade flows and the production chains built up over decades, hitting an open 
economy like the Netherlands extra hard.
In addition, it seems inevitable that Europe will be compelled to redouble its efforts in 
the area of defence. This will be a challenge for the still somewhat overheated Dutch 
economy, but certainly also for some European countries with high public debt.
How should we deal with these two challenges?

2/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
To begin with, through European strength and European unity. In today's uncertain 
world, the best thing we can do is to seek more cooperation within Europe – without 
isolating ourselves from the rest of the world.
It is essential for Europe to cooperate on defence, which is a public good of singular 
significance: if it is there, it is there for everyone. By working together in Europe, we can 
coordinate procurement, rather than each Member State buying arms and equipment 
separately. Fortunately, Europe seems to be accepting this challenge with great vigour.
The plans do come with a hefty price tag. In view of this, there is a strong case for 
giving countries a exemption from the budget rules for additional defence  temporary 
spending. These expenditures need to be done quickly and, until recently, were 
unforeseen. This exemption should, however, be temporary and limited because 
increased spending is largely structural and public debt in the EU is still too high. A 
temporary relaxation of the rules will allow countries to integrate additional defence 
spending into their budgets in the longer term. Because sustainable public finances 
may not be compromised.
A stronger Europe is important not only for defence, but also more generally for an 
open economy like the Netherlands. The European Union has a population of around 
450 million. Seventy percent of Dutch exports remain within Europe, meaning we have 
a vested interest in making Europe stronger.
European economic strength is also essential for dealing with tensions on the 
international trade front. Unfortunately, there are still barriers to working, doing business 
and investing across borders in the EU. This is why we need to strengthen the 
European single market. In particular, it is crucial to integrate European capital markets 
so that start-ups, scale-ups and European technology firms can raise capital more 
easily and cheaply and thus compete with US and Chinese firms.
The much-discussed Draghi and Letta reports and the European Commission's 
Competitiveness Compass make important proposals to improve the single market and 
European competitiveness.
What exactly does the geopolitical situation mean for policy in the Netherlands? We in 
the Netherlands have little influence on many of the developments currently taking 
place in the world. But we can do one thing. And that is to work to mitigate the 
economic consequences and perhaps seize new opportunities. Hence the theme of our 
annual report: 'Robust policies in an uncertain world'.
What do we mean by 'robust policies'?
Policies that strengthen Europe.
Policies that anticipate future challenges.
Policies that better enable us to absorb shocks.
What does this mean in concrete terms?
Let me start with ourselves. The best contribution central banks and supervisory 
authorities can make in uncertain times is to do what they were put on earth to do: 

3/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
ensure financial and price stability. We are working hard to make sure the financial 
sector, payment systems and the economy as a whole remain resilient to shocks.
Robust policies, moreover, are not only European policies, but also future-proof 
policies. For the Netherlands, this means addressing our scarcity problem. We are 
facing shortages of housing, human resources, physical space and so on. This puts 
limits on our growth, both now and in the future.
Robust policies also mean: ensuring buffers to absorb unexpected shocks. This is 
especially vital in unstable times, for both the government and the financial sector.
Public finances may be in good shape now, but in the medium term, healthcare 
spending, interest costs and now defence spending are set to rise sharply. It is 
essential that the government can continue to absorb shocks going forward, without 
financial markets becoming unsettled by mounting debt.
Sensible fiscal policy must also be pursued because of inflation, which has been too 
high in the Netherlands for too long. This can be particularly difficult for people who do 
not have much money to spend. Because Dutch inflation is higher than the euro area 
average, we cannot look to Frankfurt. Getting Dutch inflation under control is a joint 
responsibility both for the social partners and the government. In this case, robust 
policies mean that the government continues to pursue a trend-based budget policy, 
does not throw more fuel on the inflationary fire and thus anticipates long-term 
developments in the Dutch economy.
In view of all the challenges ahead, the Dutch economy is in a good starting position. 
Maintaining our prosperity requires robust policies. Policies that strengthen Europe, 
anticipate the future and create shockproof buffers. The latter, of course, is also vital for 
the financial sector. I would now like to give the floor to Steven. 
Steven Maijoor
In uncertain times, financial and economic stability are very important, as Klaas said. A 
healthy financial sector with sufficient buffers to absorb shocks is a key component of 
this stability.
Fortunately, we have seen that the financial sector has held up well during the shocks 
of recent years. Stronger regulations and the tightening of supervision after the financial 
crisis have clearly paid off. Banks are now in a much stronger position and are 
decidedly more robust.
However, we do see that the strengthening of regulations in recent years has created a 
confusing jungle of rules in a number of areas.
It would therefore be wise to simplify regulations and enhance harmonisation in Europe 
where possible. This might involve streamlining the vast quantities of technical 
standards and guidelines from European supervisory authorities.
And when it comes to minimising differences in the Banking Union and the Capital 
Markets Union, we favour regulations over directives.

4/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Simplification should not be confused with deregulation, or the relaxation of rules, for 
example the Basel III capital requirements. We should not go down that path. 
Simplifying the rules does not mean lowering the bar. Especially in this uncertain world, 
it is important to stick to robust policies. For banks, this mainly means implementing the 
agreements made in Basel III.
Gita Salden
In uncertain times, it is important that financial institutions are not only financially sound, 
but also ethically sound. A number of banks in recent years have faced enforcement 
action from us, or from the public prosecution service, for failing to combat money 
laundering adequately. On a positive note, we see clear improvement in AML efforts 
across the board.
But unintended side effects may also crop up. For example, if banks do not differentiate 
sufficiently between high-risk and low-risk files, which can result in an undue burden on 
law-abiding citizens and entrepreneurs. They may find it difficult or impossible to open a 
bank account, they may be required to answer intrusive questions, or they may be 
offboarded without clear cause. There are also customers who experience 
discrimination.
Countering financial crime can be done more efficiently and effectively through a more 
risk-based approach, smarter use of data-driven technological innovations and more 
focused cooperation throughout the chain.
Naturally I must also address the pension transition. DNB fully supports the new 
Pensions Act and the transition to the new system. Our task is clear: implement the law 
and ensure a diligent and balanced transition.
And that is exactly what we are doing: the transition is in full swing. The first four funds 
have received a positive decision on their conversion notification. Also, some 40 partial 
assessments have already been completed, and at least 40 funds are intending to 
convert within a year. Together, we are drawing important lessons from the initial 
experiences, enabling us to refine our assessment process and make it more 
predictable. This will help us achieve our mutual objective: a pension system that is 
ready for the future. 
Cindy van Oorschot
As global uncertainty increases, so does the frequency of cyberthreats. This is a matter 
of utmost urgency for everyone, but even more so for the financial sector. A quarter of 
all cyberattacks worldwide affect the financial sector. Traditionally, the sector has been 
an attractive target for cybercriminals with financial motives. But we now also face state-
sponsored cyberattacks.
As a supervisory authority, the introduction of DORA gives us a powerful tool to boost 
the resilience of the financial sector and strengthen the robustness of the entire chain of 
ICT service providers.

5/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
This includes the mandatory advanced resilience tests for large financial institutions. In 
the Netherlands, we have been carrying out such tests on a voluntary basis for more 
than eight years - under the name TIBER - with good results. In addition, we have now 
developed a more flexible version, called ART, which can also be used in other vital 
sectors.
We also put our own organisation through such tests, because we too are an attractive 
target for hackers.
Geopolitical uncertainties, including cyberthreats, affect all our tasks. In response, we 
have launched an overarching project focusing on geopolitical fragmentation to link 
existing activities in both the central bank and supervision domains to ensure that we 
are ready to act across the full breadth of our responsibilities.
Olaf Sleijpen
Geopolitical uncertainty is also high on the agenda in the field of the payment system, 
which is often the target of the cyberattacks that Cindy just mentioned.
Another concern is that the infrastructure behind our digital payments at the checkout is 
largely non-European. Although the providers of this infrastructure are regulated under 
EU rules, the policies of foreign governments can still result in control over how and to 
whom we make payments. This is undesirable.
For this reason, we support European initiatives such as Wero, which provides a 
European digital payment solution. And DNB is actively contributing to the development 
of the digital euro. The business case for the digital euro is sometimes questioned for 
the Netherlands, which has an effective and efficient payment system. In view of global 
developments, we advocate the introduction of the digital euro. Specifically, the digital 
euro will provide us with a means of payment that is independent of non-European 
parties and that will also form a reliable backup in crisis situations. This will be an 
important addition to our payment infrastructure.
The last point I would like to mention is that we will also factor global tensions into our 
own investment policy.
Our mission is to contribute to sustainable prosperity in the Netherlands. For this 
reason, we are committed to integrating sustainability into our own-account 
investments. However, sustainable prosperity will benefit not only from an orderly 
energy transition, but also from a society that is resilient, secure and stable.
That is why this year we are exploring how our own – robust – investments can also 
contribute to a resilient society. In doing so, we are of course mindful of our role as a 
long-term investor, balancing different investment themes and asset classes.
In conclusion: Robust policies and European cooperation are the remedies we need in 
this uncertain world. There now seems to be momentum for both. This is positive and it 
should give us a glimmer of hope in these bleak times.
