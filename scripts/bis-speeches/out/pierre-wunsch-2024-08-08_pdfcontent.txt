FRANKFURT SCHOOL OF FINANCE & MANAGEMENT, CENTRE 
FOR CENTRAL BANKING 
Guest lecture by Pierre Wunsch, Governor, National Bank of Belgium  
“Beyond hawks and doves: trying to get it right in an uncertain world” 
8 May 2024 – Frankfurt 
Introduction 
 
Good afternoon everyone, 
 
I am very happy to be here today, at Jens’ kind invitation, to share a few 
thoughts on the art of conducting monetary policy in uncertain times. The 
establishment of the Centre for Central Banking by Jens and Emanuel 
Moench in Frankfurt is a great initiative. I very much look forward to the 
centre’s contributions to a better understanding of the complex linkages 
between finance, central banking, and the real economy.  
 
Since I joined the ECB’s Governing Council in 2019 (and earlier as a 
backbencher), I have felt privileged to know Jens, and have learned so much 
from him.  
 
At the beginning, our views may have appeared to contrast somewhat. You 
might recall Jens being labelled as a “hawkish member” of the Council. My 
institution, the National Bank of Belgium, was instead considered to be 
rather “dovish”. And indeed, divergences were not uncommon. In 
September 2019, the Financial Times tagged Jens as – quote – “opposed in 
principle” and myself as a – quote – “supporter” of Mario Draghi’s “last big 
stimulus”.1 
 
My journey through the world of central banking has taught me a few things, 
and Jens has been instrumental in this. That’s what my speech tonight is all 
about. In fact, the working title of the speech has long been “The impact of 
seating arrangements on monetary policy”. Indeed, Jens and I share the 
privilege of having surnames beginning with “W”, meaning that we were 
neighbours at the Council table for quite some time.

A key lesson learned from being in Jens’ company is that giving central 
bankers birds’ names (hawks, doves, owls, parrots, you name it) is simplistic. 
Let it be noted once and for all: we are all staunch supporters of price 
stability. Delivering it is our mission. Our mandate is not dual; we don’t do 
trade-offs. What differentiates us, however, is our perception of risks, and 
relatedly, our willingness to take risks. 
 
That clarity of purpose has been a useful compass on my journey: I have not 
had to balance multiple goals based on personal preferences. In fact, 
maintaining inflation at 2% is simply about doing the right thing, conditional 
on what we think we know about the state of the economy and its likely 
evolution over the medium term. Under uncertainty, it amounts to managing 
the risk of missing our goal.  
 
Growth, of course, is in the background, but it is not the driver of our 
decision. Indeed, we know that being extremely risk averse or, on the 
contrary, reckless about inflation, invariably ends up killing economic 
growth. Being too tight for too long or having to put the infla tion genie back 
into the bottle both lead to subpar growth or worse.  
 
It should now be clear that, in my view, the “hawk/dove” dichotomy cannot 
capture the true nature of monetary policymaking. Hence, the title of my 
speech today: “Beyond hawks and doves: trying to get it right in an uncertain 
world”. 
 
Throughout this lecture, I will reflect upon my evolving stance on the primary 
drivers of monetary policy in recent years. I will also share some personal 
thoughts on the medium-term trajectory of monetary policy. Finally, I will 
discuss more fundamental questions around the limits of central bank 
mandates. Acute crises and urgent issues have clearly tested those limits. I 
will focus on the role of independent central banks in mitigating climate 
change and interacting with fiscal policy.  
 
 
Before COVID-19: a well-developed theory that had to be tested 
 
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, things seemed reasonably simple, at least by 
today’s standards. Aggregate demand was seen as structurally weak. For a 
host of reasons (population ageing, rising income inequality, etc.), ample 
global savings appeared to be struggling to find sufficient opportunities for 
profitable investment. Thus, equilibrium real interest rates (often referred to 

 
3 
 
as R* in our simple macro jargon) had to be very low, and inflation hovered 
below official targets. There were even signs of de-anchoring of long-term 
inflation expectations.  
 
 
 
In such circumstances, the conventional wisdom from central bank 
workhorse models (all of which belong to the class of so-called new 
Keynesian models) prescribes an extremely stimulative monetary policy. 
Indeed, in these models, imbalances stem from the demand side of the 
economy. This means that monetary policy can always handle such 
imbalances. Models describe a world of “divine coincidence” where closing 
the output gap (bringing Y to Y*) also brings inflation back to target (that is, 
pi to pi*). In the end, according to these models, our job is to align the stars 
(Y with Y*, pi with pi* and R with R*).2  
 
The problem, however, was that monetary policy had precious little room for 
manoeuvre. Conventional instruments were squeezed between an already 
low R* and the so-called effective lower bound on interest rates. That lower 
bound reflects the fact that in an economy where money can be freely 
converted into cash, the scope for negative nominal interest rates is 
bounded by the marginal cost of hoarding cash , be it at home under a 
mattress or in a bank vault.

Quite logically, the dominant view became that central banks had to provide 
the required stimulus through means other than conventional instruments. 
Beyond historically low (negative) policy rates, central banks sought to 
influence longer-term interest rates through forward guidance and asset 
purchases. They tried to boost the credit channel of monetary policy by 
providing ample liquidity to commercial banks , hoping they would lend more 
to their customers.  
 
In hindsight, it is evident that this multipronged strategy of serial big 
bazookas yielded suboptimal outcomes. Inflation remained stubbornly low, 
while the side effects of that shock therapy became increasingly evident. I 
will get back to these side effects later. 
 
 
Monetary policy during COVID-19: no regrets 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic erupted in this environment of chronically low 
demand and limited policy space. The shock was deep, sudden, and involved 
an unlikely combination of dislocated supply chains and suppressed demand. 
The costs of such disruption could not possibly be insured ex ante by anyone. 
Only governments could protect economies ex post against potentially huge 
long-term consequences that far exceeded anything a Schumpeterian 
creative destruction argument could justify. Instead, scarring was a clear and 
present danger. As moral hazard was not a consideration either, the case for 
protection was crystal clear. 
 
Of course, the policy response had to be commensurate to the shock: 
massive, quick, but reversible. Yet, policy space was not only limited on the 
monetary side but also on the fiscal side, owing to historically high public 
debt in many countries. In addition, rapid deployment and reversibility are 
features of fiscal policy, not monetary policy, which only influences 
macroeconomic outcomes with long and variable time lags. 
 
The need for a large-scale macro stimulus in a context of limited policy space 
brought the “policy mix” concept back to life. In normal times, independent 
actions by central banks and treasuries often lead to tensions in the mix. 
Typically, the central bank offsets the demand effect of fiscal policy if it sees 
the latter as running against price stability. Thus, unwarranted fiscal stimulus 
leads to tighter monetary policy, and vice versa. Game theorists would say 
that monetary policy and fiscal policy are strategic substitutes: it is in the 

 
5 
 
best interest of policymakers to offset their respective impacts on aggregate 
demand. 
 
The situation created by the pandemic turned that game on its head. Both 
monetary and fiscal policies had to be deployed to protect and stabilize the 
economy. Monetary policy — through the PEPP and other programs — 
effectively worked by creating the space required for fiscal policy to act.  
 
 
 
With the onset of the pandemic, inflation further receded . As investors and 
consumers were unable to respond to lower interest rates and cheap credit, 
monetary policy could only be effective through the government ’s role as 
the spender of last resort. It became in the best interest of the central bank 
to fully accommodate and even further encourage fiscal stimulus. During the 
pandemic, monetary and fiscal policies had temporarily become strategic 
complements. 
 
One fundamental point to emphasise is that the joint fiscal and monetary 
expansion observed in response to the pandemic reflected the actions of 
two separate sets of policymakers acting independently within their remits. 
It was never the result of ex ante coordination or backdoor deal-making. 
 
One general lesson from this peculiar episode is that quantitative easing (QE) 
can be a potent tool in times of significant shocks  and constrained policy 
space. In fact, QE likely proved effective even when operating at the 
effective lower bound in the sense that it contributed to maintaining

government debt servicing costs – denoted as “r” – below the rate of 
economic growth “g”. A negative differential between r and g improves 
public debt dynamics and alleviates concerns over debt sustainability. If 
anything, this episode should allay our apprehensions about the effective 
lower bound.

2021: a change of heart in view of inflation and financial stability risks 
 
By the end of 2020, it became clear that vaccines would help to pull us out of 
the mire. Predictably, policy normalisation would occur sooner or later. That 
meant the return of the usual interplay between monetary and fiscal policies 
and with it, the emergence of a clear risk that delayed fiscal consolidation 
would require faster and stronger monetary tightening.  
 
Logically, I started questioning the wisdom behind our apparent 
commitment to persistently low interest rates. I became particularly 
uncomfortable with forward guidance that effectively tied us to such a 
stance for an extended period. A series of dissents followed, related not only 
to forward guidance but also to the extremely gradual unwinding of asset 
purchases. 
 
I first dissented on the revision of forward guidance in July 2021, in the wake 
of the ECB’s strategy review. You might recall that the revised guidance listed 
three conditions that had to be met before the ECB could consider lifting 
policy rates.3 On the topic of forward guidance, I felt close to Jens, who had 
already highlighted several issues in 2019.4 
 
I had two main concerns. Firstly, the revised guidance flew in the face of 
proportionality when considering financial stability. Although the ECB had 
explicitly recognised “financial stability [as] a precondition to price stability”, 
the revision seemed to contradict that statement.  
 
Secondly, the stringent conditions for liftoff attached to the revised forward 
guidance effectively tied our hands in a way that could soon prove 
untenable. I saw the distinct risk of having to change course suddenly, taking 
everyone by surprise. In the end, our credibility was in the balance and with 
it, the very effectiveness of forward guidance  itself, and of monetary policy 
more generally.  
 
 
3 The three conditions were: (i) inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of the projection horizon; (ii) 
inflation forecasts being at 2% for the rest of the projection horizon; and (iii) underlying inflation being 
sufficiently advanced so as to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term. 
4 Central Banking, 31 January 2022, “Wunsch sceptical on forward guidance”. For Jens Weidmann’s speech, 
see “What the future holds – Benefits and limitations of forward guidance”, European Banking Congress, 
22 November 2019.

My discomfort about the conditions attached to forward guidance related to 
personal concerns about the weight of models in our strategic thinking. 
Much of the latter indeed seemed to hinge on models predicting that 
inflation would smoothly converge to 2%. But how reliable are models in 
times of unprecedented disturbances and policy actions?  What is the value 
of model-based inflation predictions where the endpoint of 2% is essentially 
assumed, and where convergence happens quite fast, especially if 
expectations are rational? Besides, models are bound to miss regime shifts 
and to struggle with the deep impact of tail events. And since the last 
significant inflation surge had occurred in the 1970s, models arguably 
underestimated the persistence of inflation when it started to climb.5 
 
 
 
Incidentally, the false sense of knowledge resulting from an overreliance on 
models was also at the core of the recent review of the Bank of England’s 
forecasting approach by Ben Bernanke. This review could also inspire us in 
the Eurosystem.6 On the topic of forecasts in particular, a major issue is that 
analysts tend to focus on the point estimate of inflation at the end of the 
forecasting horizon, which is about two to three years ahead. The significant 
uncertainty surrounding projections is only a second-order consideration. 
This is an issue if, like me, you believe that policymaking is about risk 
management.

One can think of two technical remedies: fan charts and alternative 
scenarios. Fan charts have the important advantage of providing a broad 
idea about projection uncertainty. However, fan charts are only as good as 
the assumptions used to build them. For instance, many fan charts reflect 
either past forecasting errors — which is not useful if uncertainty rises — or 
normally distributed shocks calibrated against past empirical moments. Fan 
charts also routinely ignore model uncertainty itself. In the end, alternative 
scenarios reflecting various modelling assumptions and shocks might be 
easier to communicate to the public and might better convey differences of 
views among Governing Council members.  
 
My second material dissent concerned the speed of disposal of the asset 
portfolio accumulated through QE. I call to mind the additional year of 
reinvestment under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP)  
sanctioned in December 2021, setting gross purchases in stone until the end 
of 2024. At the time of this decision, headline inflation was at 5% and core 
inflation was at almost 3%, but indeed our inflation projection for the end of 
the projection horizon was at 1.8%. Now, with the pandemic behind us and 
monetary policy being normalised on multiple fronts , PEPP reinvestment is 
being continued to honour an old promise. Fortunately, the impact of an 
additional year of reinvestment is limited. 
 
Overall, I disagreed with the revised forward guidance and the slow 
unwinding of the accumulated portfolio of asset purchases  out of concern 
for inflation and financial stability. With regard to the former, while the 
inflation spike reflected an energy crisis, it seems hard to deny that highly 
accommodative monetary policy facilitated the rise in inflation. 
 
With regard to financial stability, I was fearful that the serious side effects of 
loose monetary policy — in the form of misallocations and financial 
exuberance — had been underestimated. Uppermost in my mind were the 
potential for over-investment in non-productive assets, the belief that 
budget constraints were being taken lightly, an overly enthusiastic search for 
yield, the risks of asset price bubbles, and excessive leverage. Let’s not forget 
that a long period of monetary policy accommodation had probably 
increased the likelihood of a systemic financial crisis.7  
 
One might well say that “there is no financial stability issue this time 
around”. I would reply along the lines of Rajan and Acharya who warned 
 
7 See e.g. Grimm et al. (2023). 

 
10 
 
against “[t]he dangers of forgetting the 2023 banking crisis”. Time is too 
short to elaborate on this here, but my sense is that the link with the 
extremely accommodative monetary policy of the preceding years is clear.  
 
Of course, the euro area was largely unaffected by the US banking turmoil 
thanks to robust capital and liquidity buffers. But a change in sentiment 
might have weighed on credit growth and contributed to disinflation. In such 
a scenario, monetary policy tightening might have been less aggressive, 
possibly leading to a pause in rate hikes, similar to the Fed in June 2023.8 
This is a good example of how central bankers must navigate uncertain times 
by remaining agile and avoiding pre-commitments to predetermined 
policies.  
 
To sum up, one should not underestimate financial stability risks going 
forward.9 Particularly if policy rates have to be kept high for longer. And one 
should keep in mind that, in principle, a central bank can only act when 
financial stability issues are related to liquidity and not solvency issue s.10 As a 
consequence, prevention is, as always, better than cure. 
 
I could not end a discussion of the side effects of super-accommodative 
monetary policy without mentioning fiscal sustainability. There are two 
issues here. The first is that low or negative nominal interest rates on public 
debt, if maintained for too long, can encourage reckless spending trends. The 
second is that from the perspective of the consolidated public sector balance 
sheet, QE amounts to transforming long-term liabilities into overnight ones 
(bank reserves). The resulting transfer of the interest rate risk away from 
private sector balance sheets quickly becomes a costly proposition when 
policy rates must be raised. 11 Central banking today is a loss-making 
operation, something the public and some academics have a hard time 
accepting. 
 
Here again, Jens’ early warnings impacted my thinking. As early as mid-2020, 
he reminded us that “large-scale purchases of government bonds are 
associated with the risk of blurring the line between monetary and fiscal 
policy”.12

2022: I became a “hawk” in the eyes of analysts 
 
And inflation ultimately came back with a vengeance! With the pandemic 
behind us, a surprisingly strong recovery hit supply chains that were still 
under stress, and price pressures inevitably unwound. I quickly called for 
higher policy rates, a development that prompted many analysts to conclude 
decisively that I had aligned myself with the hawkish camp. 
 
In the face of mounting inflationary pressures, our workhorse models 
supported a narrative of temporary developments that did not warrant a 
policy shift. The accumulation of inflation forecast errors nevertheless 
encouraged me to question openly the dominant view.13 In early 2022, I 
characterised the return of nominal interest rates to zero or above by year-
end as a “no-brainer”.14 By mid-2022, Russia’s aggression in Ukraine had 
propelled energy prices in Europe to historic highs.  
 
 
 
As inflation continued to outpace expectations , the textbook-ish “look 
through” advice appeared to be increasingly inadequate. I called for a hike of 
at least 200 basis points to bring real rates to zero, a level at which monetary 
policy was unlikely to harm economic prospects (monetary policy would be 
considered broadly neutral), while signalling a clear resolve to deliver on our

mandate.15 Still, that judgment call had to be made under exceptional 
uncertainty. Estimates of the neutral policy rate (R*) are notoriously 
unreliable.16 As Fed Chair Powell succinctly put it, “we are navigating by the 
stars under cloudy skies”.17 
 
By the end of 2022, I found myself contemplating the prospect of rates 
reaching 3%. There was little doubt in my mind that inflationary pressures 
had to be tackled by strong policy action.18 I entered 2023 convinced that 
rates would reach the 4% threshold, which is where we are today.19 
 
Summing up and preliminary conclusions 
 
Before moving to the current policy landscape, let me briefly recap. 
 
Firstly, we’ve seen that quantitative easing proves effective in addressing the 
effects of tail economic shocks in a context of constrained policy space. QE 
worked through the monetary-fiscal policy mix.  
 
Outside times of acute crisis, QE might well be tantamount to pushing on a 
string. Neither quantitative easing nor forward guidance proved effective in 
steering inflation back to our 2% target. Besides, unconventional policies 
have side effects in terms of inflation persistence, financial stability, and 
fiscal sustainability. 
 
Secondly, models may not always be the reliable compass on which we 
should rely. We were led to believe that inflation was transitory, only to find 
out it was not. This underscores the need for a critical re-evaluation of our 
modelling frameworks and of the role of model-based projections in 
policymaking. The Bank of England recently indicated a way forward that 
we’d be well-minded to consider. 
 
Thirdly, the costs and risks associated with the effective lower bound might 
not be as serious as previously thought. On the one hand, the effective lower 
bound did not prevent an effective response to an acute crisis such as 
COVID-19. On the other hand, with inflation being a regressive tax felt by all 
of us, the perceived cost of de-anchoring upward — say above 3% — is

13 
 
arguably higher than the unease one might experience during prolonged 
episodes of inflation in the 0-1% range. 
 
Two policy conclusions can be drawn. 
 
Firstly, central banks should engage in aggressive monetary accommodation 
— through QE and forward guidance — when crises hit, and policy space is 
scarce. Outside such circumstances, “shock and awe” strategies should be 
avoided if inflation expectations remain reasonably well -anchored. This 
realisation requires a recalibration of our policy toolkit. 
 
By implication, we should also be prepared to tolerate some flexibility in 
interpreting the point inflation target of 2.0%. This is to avoid mistakes such 
as the decision to expand quantitative easing when inflation forecasts 
hovered around 1.8% in late 2021.  
 
 
Monetary policy at the current juncture 
 
Thinking about monetary policy today is fraught with conceptual and 
practical challenges. To name but a few, I would mention the rising 
prevalence of supply shocks (or relative price disturbances, if you prefer), 
heightened uncertainty over key economic relationships that we previously 
took for granted (mainly the Phillips curve), and slow-moving transitions 
(population ageing, digitalisation and the advent of AI, climate change, or the 
shortening of global value chains).  
 
Structural transformation means that the models at our disposal are 
intrinsically uncertain; or rather, even more uncertain than before. In a 
sense, the good old “Lucas critique” is back! As Bob Lucas warned us almost 
50 years ago, trusting fixed parameters and functional forms reflecting past 
behaviours can be misleading. Conventional wisdom might not be as wise as 
it used to be, because “intercepts” might shift, and critical “slopes” might 
have become steeper as a result of thus far unsuspected “non-linearities.”  
 
What might at first sound like a curiosity of modelling carries first-order 
policy implications. A case in point is the traditional advice of “looking 
through” supply shocks. The argument is simply that if inflation expectations 
are anchored, the inflation effects of temporary supply shocks will self-
correct without any policy action. That prescription, which stems from 
traditional new Keynesian models, partly explains why the ECB did not start 

 
14 
 
raising policy rates as soon as inflation emerged. Meanwhile, as we were 
“looking through,” real interest rates dived further into negative territory, 
fuelling inflation. 
 
As positive inflation forecast errors piled up, many struggled to understand 
the drivers of inflation persistence. This is hardly surprising if the most 
trusted models keep replicating a world of low and stable inflation  where 
actual policy is seen as having little effect on the process  (the “flat Phillips 
curve” view). Besides, many analysts and policymakers took comfort in long-
term inflation expectations remaining anchored at 2%.  
 
This forces us to think harder about the role of inflation expectations in our 
policy framework. In my view, we should not rest quietly on the fact that 
some preferred measure of expected inflation is firmly tied to the official 
target. Welfare reflects actual inflation, which everybody feels as the 
painfully regressive tax it is. To put it bluntly, “we do not eat expected 
inflation.”  
 
Of course, anchoring is crucial for macroeconomic stability as a deviation of 
long-term inflation expectations from 2% would be a sign of waning 
confidence in the credibility of monetary policy. And as COVID-19 showed, 
such credibility is crucial to deploying an adequate response during crises. 
However, stable long-term inflation expectations are only a necessary, not a 
sufficient, condition for macroeconomic stability. It only tells us the 
endpoint, not how we will get there. 
 
So, to understand inflation persistence — what happens between now and 
the fixed endpoint — we must look into the role of shorter-term 
expectations and their effects on wage formation. In fact, new Keynesian 
models tell us nothing else: long-term expectations play no role beyond their 
influence on shorter-term expectations.20 And in fact, the textbook new 
Keynesian Phillips curve features next-period inflation expectations.  
 
Empirically, short-term expectations are a key driver of macroeconomic 
dynamics. Recent evidence from wage growth data supports that view.21 
Workers seem to take short-term inflation expectations into account in the 
wage-bargaining process, in addition to past inflation; while longer-term 
expectations play virtually no independent role. Indeed, if workers know that

they can renegotiate their wages every year or every other year, longer-term 
developments are largely irrelevant. A similar reasoning holds for firms’ 
pricing behaviours. 
 
The role of short-term expectations in price- and wage-setting behaviours 
feeds into one of my concerns about inflation persistence: the emergence of 
wage-price spirals. If short-term inflation expectations matter for wage- and 
price-formation mechanisms, a rise in these expectations would encourage 
workers to raise wage demands and firms to increase sales prices in a sort of 
“tit-for-tat” game.22 A terms-of-trade shock makes such tit-for-tat dynamics 
even more likely, as each agent has an incentive to transfer the impact of the 
shock onto the other, even though the shock makes the entire economy 
poorer. 
 
 
 
Thus, placing a greater emphasis on short-term inflation expectations and 
wage dynamics seems advisable in order to navigate the current climate.23  
 
As the effects of energy shocks dissipate, firms have tended to reduce profit 
margins in the face of persistent wage growth. While firms may have taken 
advantage of the inflationary environment to increase prices  (so-called 
“greedflation”), they may also have anticipated that wages would ultimately

catch up with price increases. If so, margins would simply play a buffer role, 
reflecting the greater rigidity of nominal wages compared to prices.  
 
While such conjecture appears plausible, theoretical models struggle to 
capture ongoing inflation dynamics. The formal debate revolves around the 
specific form of the Phillips curve. For one thing, the stability observed in 
long-term inflation expectations suggests that the curve did not shift 
upwards. This means that monetary policy credibility has been preserved. An 
upward shift in the curve would have meant higher inflation regardless of 
the state of the real economy, and thus a greater likelihood of tit-for-tat 
manoeuvres. As such, and as seen in the 1980s, central banks would have 
had to regain credibility at the cost of causing a protracted slowdown in 
economic activity, and most probably, a serious recession. 
 
There has been even more debate around the shape of the curve, and 
namely, its slope and curvature. Non-linearity could mean that the slope of 
the curve depends on the level of inflation. This would be consistent with the 
view that firms would feel less constrained by competition and would be less 
hesitant to raise prices in an inflationary context (or one characterised by 
strong demand24) compared to a low inflation (or depressed) environment. 
This kind of conjecture would help explain the inflation surge as well as the 
seemingly painless disinflation process observed so far.  
 
Recent empirical evidence concerning the Phillips curve is consistent with 
signs of a steepening trajectory.25 While models need time to adjust to a new 
reality, microeconomic evidence points more clearly to an increase in the 
frequency of price adjustments by firms.

That said, since the curve does not appear to have shifted upward,  policy 
credibility remains intact, and there is no case for maintaining tight 
monetary conditions beyond those strictly necessary to stabilise the 
economy. Not surprisingly, markets have already priced in rate cuts in the 
short term. Looking at the €STR forward curve, a first cut is expected in June, 
with one or two additional cuts envisaged by year end. A similar picture 
emerges from the ECB’s survey of monetary analysts.  
 
 
 
Of course, uncertainty around such scenarios remains considerable. 
Distributions of €STR forward rates around the baseline are wide.

addition, the recent volatility in interest rates underscores the need for 
caution when looking at market prices. After the last rate hike in September 
2023, long-term rates plunged by about 90 basis points by the end of the 
year due to expectations for monetary policy easing after better-than-
expected inflation data. However, since the beginning of this year, long-term 
rates paired back some of their earlier decline as expectations for rate cuts 
moderated somewhat.  
 
For central banks, dealing with uncertainty means remaining data-
dependent. Now is not the time to commit to a preset course of action. It is 
about using our discretion wisely… about getting it right, as information 
about the state of the economy becomes available. Significant risks remain 
around the trajectory of wage growth and inflation in wage-intensive 
services. Despite recent signs of moderation, more will be known about the 
dynamics of wages and services inflation at the June Governing Council 
meeting.  
 
Of course, data dependence also requires some willingness to take risks, as 
uncertainty complicates the early detection of new trends. 26 To be sure, the 
road ahead is likely to be a bumpy one for services and core inflation. Real-
time inflation readings will likely be quite volatile over the next few months. 
As wages are intrinsically more rigid than prices, wage growth is expected to 
remain broadly constant this year. This would imply that real wages catch up 
with their pre-pandemic levels. Of course, we still cannot exclude that 
workers demand compensation for several years of depressed purchasing 
power. 
 
 
26 Wauters (2023).

All in all, and although the outlook remains foggy, I see a path for initiating 
rate cuts this year. Firstly, our inflation forecasts have recently become more 
reliable. Secondly, we continue to predict a return of inflation to the official 
target by end-2025. Thus, with no sign of de-anchoring in the longer term, 
the costs of remaining tight for too long seem to outweigh those of a 
premature loosening. This boils down to what I have recently described as 
the Governing Council having to “make a bet” on inflation staying in line with 
projections.27  
 
One known unknown remains the role of the exchange rate and the risk of 
importing inflation. While monetary policy tightening was remarkably 
synchronous around the world, easing cycles appear unlikely to exhibit 
similar synchronicity. Diverging economic conditions and policies on both 
sides of the Atlantic might lead to significant effects from the dollar-euro 
exchange rate. 
 
 
The mandate under pressure on two main fronts  
 
Before concluding, I would like to take a step back and discuss two matters 
related to the boundaries of central bank mandates. The first pertains to the 
evolving public discourse on climate change and its implications for 
 
27 Econostream Media, 8 February 2024, “ECB’s Wunsch: ‘At some point, we are going to have to bet on 
where inflation’s going’”. Reuters, 13 March 2024, “ECB should ‘make a bet’ on rates before long, says 
Wunsch”. Bloomberg, 13 March 2024, “ECB must take a bet on rate cut as prices abate, Wunsch says”.

monetary policy. The second revolves around the interactions between fiscal 
and monetary policies. 
 
While these two considerations might appear to be orthogonal to one 
another, they were joined at birth by the reference in the ECB’s mandate to 
Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Taken together, the ECB is 
expected to support EU policies as long as price stability is not jeopardi sed.  
 
For many, supporting EU policies means using our very deep pockets to tilt 
relative prices in directions deemed desirable from a social welfare point of 
view. Specifically, we could buy green assets to lower the funding costs of 
decarbonisation. We could provide fiscal space to governments so they can 
meet the ever-increasing demands on already stretched domestic budgets. 
 
Let me say it loudly and clearly: be careful what you wish for! Pushing central 
banks into the inherently political waters of tilting relative prices could open 
Pandora’s box: never-ending mission creep and ultimately, politicisation 
would loom large.  
 
Let me now take these issues on one at a time. 
 
Climate change 
 
On climate change, I have gone on the record on two key occasions in 2021 
and 2023. As you might guess, Jens had already made interventions in 
2019.28 
 
 
28 Wunsch (2021, 2023b, 2024b), Weidmann (2019b, 2021a, 2021b).  

 
21 
 
 
 
There has been a growing chorus of voices calling on central banks to take a 
more proactive role in addressing climate change. While I acknowledge the 
criticality of a successful climate transition, let’s keep in mind the inherent 
limitations of monetary policy in dealing with allocative efficiency issues.  
 
Monetary policy is a blunt instrument and one unfit to tweak relative prices 
in socially desirable ways. To achieve the latter, an array of fiscal instruments 
are available which embody the key virtues of being quick, targeted and 
reversible. 
 
Admittedly, my view is a minority one within the ECB Governing Council. I 
nevertheless take some comfort in the fact that this view is more popular in 
the Anglo-Saxon world. Chairman Powell famously said last year that “We 
[the Fed] are not, and will not be, a climate policymaker”.  
 
Another source of relief for me is that integrating climate change in 
monetary policy has so far remained a largely conceptual discussion. The 
actions taken to tilt corporate bond purchases and the collateral framework 
have been rather symbolic. I would be more concerned if actions went 
beyond symbols in the future. 
 
That said, when discussing climate change in relation to monetary policy 
instruments, one should distinguish between direct action on relative prices 
and a risk-based approach.  
 
                         
       
  
               
                                  

 
22 
 
A risk-based approach should be understood as recognising the higher risks 
of default at the firm level arising from exposure to climate developments or 
policies. In that case, it is natural to consider that risk when implementing 
monetary policy through asset purchases or when accepting collateral. 
Central banks impose similar requirements on the commercial banks they 
supervise. As Jens put it: “[c]entral banks should practise what they preach”. 
Central banks should factor in climate-related financial risks into their risk 
management, as they do for many other risks.  
 
Beyond default risks at the firm level, central banks also look at climate risks 
from a financial stability perspective. Here, stress tests are a relevant tool. 
These should consider the relatively low duration of bank balance sheets. 
One should for instance avoid conducting stress tests with static balance 
sheets over long periods.  
 
The calibration of stress tests is a difficult balancing act. Recently, the ECB 
conducted a stress test with carbon prices of $600/tCO2 in a so-called 
“orderly” scenario and $1 000/tCO2 by 2050 in a “disorderly” scenario.29 The 
latter corresponds to a shock which would push the price of oil up to almost 
$450 per barrel. Now, how likely is it that governments would produce a 
shock bigger than the recent energy crisis while at the same time not 
offering any support to the economy? Not very likely, I would say, at least, 
not if recent opinion polls on the coming European elections are any guide. 
 
Regarding action on relative prices beyond individual risks of default, the 
role of monetary policy is most contentious. The short version of the 
argument is that textbooks usually give monetary policy no role in terms of 
allocative efficiency. Now, as a group of Belgian NGOs has actively 
campaigned against my reappointment as governor given my position on the 
topic, I might as well give you the somewhat longer version.  
 
Proponents of an active role for the ECB in greening our economies mention 
Article 3 of the TEU, to which the ECB mandate refers. The mandate reads: 
“Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support 
the general economic policies in the Union […]”. The general economic 
policies laid out in Article 3 cover many objectives. By isolating action on 
climate change, an “animal farm” reading of the Treaty would put us in the 
position of prioritising the issue without clear criteria for making such a 
choice nor the political legitimacy to do so.  
 
29 ECB (2022). 

 
23 
 
 
Moreover, the condition “[W]ithout prejudice to the objective of price 
stability” is a weak one: with the ECB balance sheet running at about €7 
trillion, one could argue in favour of spending €10 billion on any policy issue 
without really affecting the monetary policy stance and hence  without 
immediate prejudice to the primary mandate.  
 
More crucially, is a central bank’s involvement in climate policy about 
supporting policy or correcting policy failures? Conceptually, the economists’ 
first best recommendation to fight climate change would be to introduce a 
Pigouvian tax on carbon, to force polluters to account for their externalities. 
Now, if elected authorities were to set the CO2 price at the socially optimal 
level, monetary policy would not have any additional role to play. And if 
authorities were to set the price too low, changing this price through 
monetary policy would be tantamount to correcting a policy failure, which is 
controversial.  
 
Once again, unelected policymakers cannot legitimately make choices with 
first-order redistributive implications. As soon as one recognises that fighting 
climate change implies trade-offs, there is a very fine line between 
supporting policy and making policy. Conceptually, one would need to 
change the nature of the trade-off, with more efficient instruments than 
those available to policymakers, to be on safer grounds. But this is unlikely to 
be the case for the reasons I just explained.  
 
Finally, monetary policy faces a communication challenge when dealing with 
climate change. Many people believe that central banks are just another kind 
of bank providing credit to the economy. But they are not . It is therefore 
crucial to avoid creating expectations that central banks can finance the 
energy transition.  
 
Fiscal-monetary policy interactions 
 
Another issue at the frontier of discussions around central bank mandates is 
the relationship between monetary and fiscal policies.  I have already made 
some key points when discussing the role of the policy mix during the COVID -
19 pandemic, but I’d like briefly to elaborate on a few more general 
considerations. 
 
Since the 1990s, granting political independence to central banks , along with 
a well-defined mandate to achieve price stability, has been one of the most 

 
24 
 
widespread and successful institutional reforms in the world. It brought 
macroeconomic stability that was sorely lacking during the 1980s.  
 
The core idea is simple and intuitive. To avoid inflationary monetary policy, it 
makes sense to keep the insatiable appetite of governments for spending 
well separated from a creditor with potentially infinitely-deep pockets and 
offering very generous funding terms (zero interest). 
 
It remains that even if they live separate lives, monetary and fiscal 
authorities are tied by the intertemporal budget constraint of the 
consolidated public sector. The question then becomes: who will ultimately 
assume responsibility for fulfilling that budget constraint?  
 
If monetary policy is to be credibly assigned to preserving price stability, then 
the Treasury must assume the sole responsibility for sticking to the budget 
constraint. This is sometimes known as ensuring a regime of monetary 
dominance, and it explains why many governments (in Europe and 
elsewhere) have committed to specific fiscal rules banning excessive deficits 
and debts. The opposite situation, in which the central bank is forced to fulfil 
the budget constraint, is labelled as fiscal dominance. 
 
Recent years have blurred the previously neat demarcation lines between 
the two policy realms.  
 
Firstly, as discussed earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic created a situation in 
which both sets of instruments were strategic complements: it was in the 
best interest of monetary policy to create space for fiscal poli cy, and in the 
best interest of fiscal policy to use that space to respond to the crisis. 
However, this made us forget that the normal situation is one of strategic 
substitutability, in which monetary policy offsets the effects of fiscal policy 
on aggregate demand.  
 
I am afraid that to this day, too many governments are continuing to 
sleepwalk into a world in which central banks are expected to continue to 
help at any cost, given the magnitude and multiplicity of the challenges we 
all face. My view is different: two years of strategic complementarity and 
crisis management might have left governments with a sense that it was OK 
not to make difficult choices anymore. Well, it’s not OK.  
 
Secondly, jitters in sovereign debt markets have prompted some central 
banks to intervene to avoid costly panics and preserve the stability of the 

 
25 
 
financial system. A prominent example is the intervention by the Bank o f 
England to avert a bout of panic related to overambitious fiscal 
announcements. In the euro area, the fragmentation of the fiscal landscape  
— one central bank and many national treasuries — led to the creation of 
explicit, conditional stabilization tools — OMT and TPI — aimed at avoiding 
unwarranted market panic. Of course, these instruments only make sense in 
order to prevent intrinsically solvent governments being subject to 
devastating liquidity crises. Other mechanisms outside the ESCB — namely 
ESM loans — exist to handle fundamental fiscal sustainability issues.  
 
Thirdly, a persistent combination of unsound public finances and 
accommodative monetary policy could have contributed to the undermining 
of commitments to fiscal responsibility. Jens’ cautionary words from 2020 
resonate loudly today: “Cheap money may be increasingly seen as the 
normal state. Under those conditions, even high debt burdens may appear 
sustainable to governments. But what if conditions change? ”.30  
 
These considerations leave me with an uneasy feeling that fragile public 
sector balance sheets and mounting fiscal challenges (population ageing, 
defence, climate action) might become a persistent concern for central 
bankers. In a world in which governments have emerged from a series of 
crises as highly effective financiers and insurers of last resort, they are, 
perhaps more than ever before, too important to fail… The implication is 
that the risk of fiscal crisis might have become a shadow constraint on 
monetary policy. This is what I characterised a year ago, at the ECB Watchers 
conference, as a weak form of fiscal dominance.31 
 
Coming back to Article 3, does it mean that we should support sound fiscal 
policies and tilt our purchases against high debt or deficit countries? That 
doing so is actually mandated by the Treaty? I do not believe so. But it does 
illustrate the need to better define the limits of our mandate s and actions. In 
short, be careful what you wish for.  
 
 
Conclusion

31 Wunsch (2023a). 

 
26 
 
Let me now try to conclude this long voyage through the land of hawks and 
doves. By now, I hope that I have convinced you that we have learned a lot 
from the experiences of the last few years. And also, that monetary policy is 
about much more than a fight between two established camps, that it is 
more than a football match. 
 
 
 
In a nutshell, aside from times of crisis, monetary policy has been more 
constrained by the effective lower bound than we thought. Persistent 
inflation — which our models had essentially assumed away — has come 
back with a vengeance, although medium-term expectations remain well-
anchored. This points to the need to revisit the reliance on some instruments 
and tools. While QE proved effective in the midst of crises, it failed to bring 
us back to target within a reasonable timeframe. As regards forward 
guidance, it also proved relatively inefficient compared to the cost of tying 
our hands.  
 
Where does this leave us? Probably with a humbler form of monetary policy. 
One that tolerates some more deviation from our target when economic 
conditions are benign and when risks of larger deviations are contained. This 
is more art than science.  
 
Beyond these lessons on the inflation front, I have briefly discussed two 
issues pertaining to the limits of our mandates. I have argued that we are 
both testing these limits, with our climate policies, and being tested, with a 
weak form of fiscal dominance. None of the two are particularly salient as I

deliver this lecture, but they could become more prominent in the coming 
years, especially if public deficits do not decline as planned, and if our 
climate ambitions move from the symbolic to the more impactful. 
 
Central bank independence is a humbling privilege for unelected officials. It 
should come with a narrow mandate. As Jens (him again) once said, “central 
bankers are not superheroes”.32 Yet they must show extraordinary agility to 
adapt and respond to extraordinary circumstances. Be it during the recent 
COVID-19 pandemic or the “whatever it takes” episode, we may be called 
upon as architects and enablers of effective solutions. But however forceful 
these actions may be, they should remain exceptional and temporary. They 
should also pass a simple smell test: do we have tools at our disposal that 
elected politicians do not have, that are more efficient, and that they would 
want us to use?  
 
Thank you for bearing with me. This was indeed itself an attempt at getting it 
right in an uncertain world.
