Ladies and Gentlemen,  
I am delighted to be  in Florence and I wish to warmly thank Marco Buti for the 
invitation. 
If an observer were to look only at the current macroeconomic data - and in 
particular the sustained convergence of headline inflation to our target of 2% - it 
might occur to him or to her that economic stability has been achieved… but on 
closer inspection, it is certainly not guaranteed for the future. This is the paradox 
I will explore with you today, using this simple chart that combines two 
dimensions: time and the scope of economic policies. 
 
I will come back to the left -hand column. But I want to stress the obvious: the 
other economic policy levers are not working well today. This is because we 
have overused the fiscal instrument through past crises (Covid, inflation) and, 
asymmetrically, we are correcting this too slowly today, from the United States 
to my own country. Conversely, we have not sufficiently promoted structural 
reforms for growth and productivity. The other obvious point is that 
unpredictability is peaking for the future, notably due to the policy shift by the 
new US administration. Europe knows how it should respond to seize its 
moment, thanks to the Letta and Draghi reports. I commend them, here in Italy. 
A quarter of a century after our monetary sovereignty, we must now ensure our 
economic and financial sovereignty.  But so far, Europe’s reaction is too slow

and too weak: I call for a mobilising date, as Jacques Delors did with January 1, 
1993, for the single market, for example 1 January, 2028i. As a nice saying goes: 
“The difference between a dream and a project is a deadline” [“La differenza tra 
un sogno e un obiettivo è una data di scade nza”]. Monetary policy cannot do 
everything, and the euro area must not resign itself to being trapped in a state 
of controlled inflation but sluggish growth. 
Today, I will focus on the two boxes on the left, and delve into two conundrums 
with you:  
- Why the current monetary situation is credible, but not static (I).  
- Why the monetary policy of tomorrow must therefore be agile, while 
remaining predictable (II). 
I. Credible but not static? The “2 and 2” 
1.1 The current situation is satisfying… 
Allow me to start with the obvious: inflation has been successfully brought back 
to target and this is excellent news. We are now in a good position in the euro 
area (EA), with inflation at 1.9% in May and forecast at 2.0 % for this year o n 
average. Hence, our Governing Council, around President Lagarde, decided to 
cut the deposit facility rate to 2%  at our meeting two weeks’ ago . Our latest 
projections show that we shouldn’t fear in Europe, contrary to the US, an 
inflationary effect of tariffs. With this latest decision, our short-term policy interest 
rate is very close to the centre of estimates of the nominal neutral rate. 
This “2 and 2” scenario of inflation close to target and policy close to neutral 
feels like back to normality , after nearly a contrasted decade, sequenced first 
with below target inflation and recourse to a number of non -conventional 
monetary policy instruments , followed by  an opposite phase with  the largest 
inflationary shock in decades  and an inverted yield curve . Back to normal is a 
very positive step; nevertheless, in still abnormal times, it does not necessarily 
mean an end to the journey.

This return to 2% inflation is also highly satisfying as the disinflation from the 
peak of 10.6% in October 2022  was much less costly in terms of ou tput and 
employment than feared. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the 
launch of the euro, at 6%. Thanks to the credibility of the Eurosystem, this time, 
the effects of commodity price shocks quickly faded away and their propagation 
to core inflation was quite limited because medium-term inflation expectations 
remained broadly stable, providing a solid “anchor" to prices and wage-setting. 
 


Page 4 sur 11 
 
 
As I have discussed in recent speechesii, Banque de France researchiii suggests 
that, had inflation expectations been as poorly anchored as they were in the 
1970s in the US, our policy rates would have had to peak around 8% instead of 
4%. This central bank credibility doesn’t come out of the blue. When politicians 
undermine central bank independence, they put in peril this credibility that allows 
central banks to stabilise inflation at a lower cost. 
1.2… but not static 
But this return to “2 and 2”  should not give way to complacency and passivity . 
China’s mercantilism and the current US administration’s erratic tariff policy 
have severely undermined the rules -based international trading system. In 
addition, global bond markets  seem increasingly worried by public debt  
sustainability in the US and across the world , and we already see signs of 
tensions at the very long end of yield curves , with the risk of international 
spillovers. 
 
Furthermore, as we could see once again since Thursday, oil price strongly 
reacts to dramatic geopolitical events.  


Page 5 sur 11 
 
 
 
It’s now back to its pre “Liberation day” level, but still far below the 2022 level, 
after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We will monitor closely the possible 
spillovers of energy prices. If ever these consequences happened to be lasting 
and propagating – i.e. affecting underlying inflation and inflation expectations –
, we could possibly adapt our monetary policy: to put it short, no automatic 
monetary reaction, but “monetary agility” on which I will elaborate further.  
Over the longer term, other supply shocks are likely to occur more frequently . 
Extreme climate events are also likely to disrupt supply chains.  Information 
technologies are developing at a fast pace, with AI and quantum computing 
likely to be the next technological shocks that will possibly increase productivity. 
More frequent supply shocks  will not mean per se higher inflation , but very 
probably a more volatile inflation, which could weaken the anchoring of inflation 
expectations. 
Because the current equilibrium is unstable, we must above all avoid being  
complacent. As we have now entered a territory close to the neutral stance, the 
natural rate R* becomes a less meaningful guidepost. T he debate is no longer 
about navigating by the “stars” to wonder whether we are restrictive or 
accommodative. It is about how to temper volatility in a world of uncertainty.  
Here agility and laying out a clear reaction function play a crucial role. 


Page 6 sur 11 
 
 
II. Agile but predictable  
Fair enough about agility, and nobody would recommend rigidity. But let us 
acknowledge that it raises two serious questions.  
a/ Agility does not mean that we should rush to come back to the 2% target at 
short notice, in case of inflation volatility. We have a medium-term orientation 
around our symmetric objective, which implies we do not have to respond to 
deviations from target at one point in time. Instead, we have to react to dynamics 
that risk pushing inflation off target: what matters is whether a deviation from 
target is more likely to increase or to decreaseiv. And medium term means within 
our projection horizon. 
b/ Agility should not imply that we are unpredictable or indecisive. In the past, 
when we had strong forward guidance, our actions were described as being on 
"autopilot”. Today, we are sometimes accused of the opposite – "flying blind" or 
making "ad hoc decisions." I do not believe we are doomed to wander between 
these two extremes: it is time to return to a concept that has  been less used in 
recent years – the central bank reaction function. We need to clearly state not 
what we will do, but how we think and will act, in a “readable” way. 
2.1 The central bank reaction function 
What is the Eurosystem reaction function? Since 2023, our reaction function has 
been based on three criteria: the inflation outlook; trends in underlying inflation; 
and the transmission mechanism. 
When inflation was surging and monetary policy was tightening rapidly, it was 
natural that the second and third criteria were emphasized. With high uncertainty 
about the inflation outlook, it was important to ensure that inflation expectations 
did not beco me deanchored and the underlying inflation criteria was this 
backstop.  
Likewise it was important to assess how quickly changes in policy rates were 
transmitting to borrowers and ultimately to the demand and supply of credit.  

Page 7 sur 11 
 
 
Indeed, the transmission lags have been at least as swift and satisfactory in this 
latest cycle as in previous ones: each rise in the deposit facility rate (DFR) was 
almost fully transmitted to bank loans to business es and households within a 
year. Loan volumes in the euro area weakened sharply starting from the end of 
2022, with a peak response 18 months after a rate hike. However, we must 
remain vigilant today to the broader transmission of monetary policy actions to 
financial conditions . In particular, we need to be careful that international 
spillovers via higher term premia in long term yields and the exchange rate do 
not counteract the desired monetary stance. I will come back to it.  
Inflation projections and the use of scenarios  
That said, now that inflation has returned to target, with inflation expectations 
well anchored, we can put more weight on the first criteria, the inflation outlook.  
But inflation projections rely on various assumptions. Developing scenarios and 
applying informed judgment about p ossible future o utcomes can assist 
policymakers. But scenario analysis is no panacea. First, we can only analyse 
in detail a few scenarios at a time, in practice one or two as we did early June 
with a severe and a mild scenario on trade. We will inevitably overlook certai n 
shocks that do appear. Second, it might be difficult to assign probabilities to 
scenarios and therefore to use them for poli cy risk management, especially in 
periods of ‘Knightian’ uncertainty – not quantifiable.  
Theoretically appealing approaches, like model averaging, are difficult to apply 
in practice. Instead, we could consider methods inspired by robust control . 
Specifically, robust control aims at avoiding the worst possible outcome, for 
example easing monetary policy exaggeratedly when an inflationary shock 
materializes. But this leads to making decisions and ruling out options based on 
hypothetical scenarios, irres pective of their likelihood. So scenarios will be an 
important aid to decision -making but should be used judiciously rather than 
systematically: not in all occurrences of ECB forecasts, and subject to discretion 
rather than rules in their policy implications. 

Page 8 sur 11 
 
 
Three principles of monetary agility 
Given all this, let me give you several thoughts on what agility means: 
• Speed of assessment . In rapidly changing circumstances or complex 
shocks, there is always the temptation to wait for additional data to obtain 
a fuller picture. To be agile is to do this analysis faster by exploiting new 
real-time data sources, incorporate new models from the latest research, 
survey new staff analyses on risks and contingencies , and avoid the 
excess of group thinking. For example, our analysis of the effects of tariffs 
have benefited from using daily shipping data and freight prices.  
• Symmetric and state -contingent policy paths . We rightly stress that 
our monetary action should be as “ persistent and forceful ” as needed v. 
But is there a contradiction between persistence in policy and agility? No, 
not if signals are understood to be state -contingent and we avoid being 
boxed in. If the state changes then so does the policy, including possibly 
its symmetric direction both ways. Persistence is only relevant in certain 
states of the world. 
• Acting not stronger but sometimes faster . And what about a forceful 
response? If required, it is not compulsory to go in incremental steps. Of 
course, in the presence of new shocks, central banks may prefer a wait -
and-see attitude, in line with Brainard's principle of mitigation vi: if the 
effects of policies are uncertain, it is better to react less. But, conversely, 
waiting too long for events to materialize can result in substantial losses. 
The Banque de France research p aper entitled “The pitfall of 
cautiousness in monetary policy” has shown that this attitude can lead to 
a cautionary bias that undermines inflation expectationsvii. This may imply 
shorter and swifter interest rate cycles, although any adjust ments still 
have to be orderly. 
2.2 What should we do now? 

Page 9 sur 11 
 
 
High uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook obviously calls for 
humility about our ability to predict future inflation and monetary action . Our 
primary duty today is to assess risks. I mentioned earlier oil prices, while 
avoiding to draw automatic monetary conclusions. Overreacting, or conversely 
systematically “looking through”, would be contrary to the necessary agility. We 
should monitor at least two other sets of data:  
- Do inflation expectations reflect a risk of lasting spillover? They don’t, so 
far, as m edium term market based measures of inflation expectations 
have recently remained clearly below 2% in 2026. The probability that 
inflation falls below 1.5% in 5 years is around 40% according to the pricing 
of options on inflation. 
 
- How is the exchange rate of the euro evolving? Since early 2025, the euro 
has appreciated by 1 1% against the US dollar : this came a bit as a 
surprise, and a sign of increasing relative confidence towards Europe. 
Obviously, we have no target for the exchange rate, and the last decade 
since 2015 has seen a striking diminution of volatility of the pair.  


Page 10 sur 11 
 
 
 
That does not nevertheless mean any “benign neglect” on our side: the 
recent appreciation of the euro has a clear disinflationary effect. According 
to our elasticities, its magnitude, for a 10% appreciation, would broadly 
compensate the inflationary effect of a possible 10 EUR increase of th e oil 
price – which we are still quite far from as of today. 
From today's perspective, the risk of undershooting our 2% inflation target  is 
perceived by markets as  greater than that of overshooting . In the June 
projections, h eadline inflation is indeed seen to fall below 2% in the second 
quarter of 2025 and to continue to decline into early 2026, with a trough of 
around 1.4%.  
 


Page 11 sur 11 
 
 
This decline would be driven by all the main components , not only energy but 
also core inflation, resulting from low wage growth and weak demand . The  
projected increase in headline inflation to 2.0% in 2027 is amplified by  a 
temporary upward impact from energy inflation, reflecting the introduction of the 
new Emissions Trading System (ETS2). This measure is desirable but far from 
certain both in its timing and modalities. 
In such a context, we need to remain alert and agile, in all our next meetings. 
As Voltaire said “Le doute n'est pas un état bien agréable mais l’assurance est 
un état ridicule viii” [“doubt is not a very pleasant state, but certainty is a ridiculous 
one”].  With this due wisdom, let me only give two possible landmarks: 
(i) a neutral rate and a terminal rate are two different animals. They can happen 
to be in the same position, but they are not identical by nature. 
(ii) the current assessment suggests that , barring a major exogenous shock,  
including possible new military developments in the Middle East, if monetary 
policy were to move in the next six months , it could be more in the direction of 
accommodation.  
Conclusion 
According to  a great Florentine,  Niccolò Machiavelli , two forces  shape the 
course of events: fortuna and virtù. Fortuna, or fate, stands for the unpredictable 
shocks that affect us – geopolitical tensions, technological disruptions, and other 
external forces beyond our control. Virtù, or courage, by contrast, reflects our 
ability to act with determination, to adapt, and to anticipate. In a context of 
heightened uncertainty, the tension between stability and volatility puts our 
monetary policy stance to the test. But through virtù – our capacity for clear -
sighted and agile action – we can secure lasting success. Monetary policy can, 
along the principles suggested, remain not only agile, but also predictable and 
“readable”. Striking this balance, we ensure that , with the highest ever 
confidence (at 83%) of our fellow European citizens, the euro remains ready to 
navigate an uncertain future.
