Yannis Stournaras: Central banks - opportunities and implications 
posed by artificial intelligence
Speech by Mr Yannis Stournaras, Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the ECONDAT 
Conference on "Economics with nontraditional data and analytical tools", London, 6 
June 2025.

Introduction
Many thanks to the conference organisers for inviting me to be here today. It's a 
privilege to be part of this dialogue that is helping to shape the digital era.
Central banks may seem far removed from your world-but we share an important 
feature: all of us are engaged in understanding complexity, managing uncertainty, and 
preparing for the future.
Today, I would like to discuss how central banks can harness the transformative 
potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in their mission to safeguard monetary and financial 
stability. My remarks will unfold along three dimensions, focusing on several important 
issues, but without being exhaustive.
First, on the ways that AI intersects with our monetary policy strategy at the 
European Central Bank (ECB).
Second, on the opportunities AI offers to central banks for efficiency gains in 
areas such as communication and economic analysis.
Third, on the implications posed by AI for price stability, monetary policy 
transmission and financial stability.
Intersections of monetary policy strategy with AI
So, let me briefly discuss the ways that AI intersects with our monetary policy strategy.
When the ECB Governing Council embarked on its strategy review last year, we made 
it clear that price stability remains our objective. We also decided to keep the 
symmetric, 2% inflation target unchanged.
The clarity which that objective provides, and our success in achieving that objective, 
have provided the ECB with credibility, which was essential in keeping inflation 
expectations anchored around the 2 per cent level during the recent inflation surge.
Although our updated strategy is only expected to be concluded and announced later 
this year, the following is important.
When the review was initiated, no one could have possibly foreseen the tectonic 
eruptions to the geopolitical landscape that ensued.

These developments have only reinforced the importance of the review and the need to 
ensure that our policies will remain fit for a rapidly evolving world -- a world that is now 
being shaped by geopolitical tensions, trade disruptions, ongoing climate change, and 
rapid advances in artificial intelligence.
In such a world, central banks need to be able to respond with agility, which is 
undoubtedly a guiding virtue for everyone in this room.
We have to deliver a strategy that is not only robust but also flexible: one that allows 
adjustments to the monetary policy stance and our toolkit in response to shocks 
and provides a foundation that can guide the Governing Council in navigating through 
challenges in the years to come.
In today's fast-moving environment-where inflation dynamics can shift rapidly, financial 
conditions are increasingly volatile and uncertainty is ever-present-we need to improve 
our ability to communicate, assess economic developments in real time and make more 
accurate projections of the outlook to guide our monetary policy making.
This is where AI begins to play a potentially transformative role. In the following, I will 
focus on the opportunities provided by AI in core central banking fields, namely 
communication and economic analysis.
Opportunity to enhance communication
I start with communication.
Central banks have come a long way in their communication strategies. As you may 
know, it was not always the case that the words "central bank" and "communication" 
could even stand together in the same sentence.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the conventional wisdom among central bankers was: "the less 
said, the better." The aim was often to surprise markets with the announcement of their 
policy decisions. Significant policy decisions were sometimes made without immediate 
public disclosure, and the rationale behind them was not always transparently 
communicated. The language used would often make the oracles of Delphi seem 
crystal clear.
Alan Greenspan once captured this perfectly when he said, "if I seem unduly clear to 
."you, you must have misunderstood what I said
Things began to change in the 1980s and 1990s. Two factors, in particular, helped 
bring about this change.
The first factor was credibility. As more and more central banks adopted inflation 
targeting frameworks, they realized that to achieve their targets, they needed to control 
inflation expectations. In other words, they needed to be credible.

3/9 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The second factor was independence. As central banks achieved independence from 
politicians, they also had to communicate in a transparent way with the public to help 
build trust, and safeguard accountability.
An important corollary of the improved communication is that it has increased the 
effectiveness of monetary policy transmission.
The previous ECB strategy review in 2021 consolidated this finding, while also calling 
for central banks in the euro area to use simpler and engaging language to directly 
access a broader audience.
More recently, efforts are being made to exploit AI for the benefit of our communication 
processes, to enhance transparency, foster trust, and ensure that our monetary policy 
reaction function is clearly understood, thereby supporting the anchoring of inflation 
expectations.
An important application involves the sentiment analysis of official publications, such as 
monetary policy statements, speeches, and press releases. For example, using Large 
Language Models (LLMs) the impact of ECB statements on financial marketscan be 1 
explored. This kind of work helps understand how the language in communications 
shapes market expectations for inflation and interest rates.
AI models can be trained on financial and policy-specific issues to detect subtle shifts in 
tone - such as whether a message appears more hawkish (in favour of tighter monetary 
policy) or dovish (in favour of looser monetary policy) - before publication. This allows 
communications teams to adjust language in order to ensure it aligns with the intended 
policy signal, minimising the risk of misinterpretation by the markets that could trigger 
undue volatility.
AI can also play a growing role in the crafting and refining of speeches by policy 
makers. LLMs can support a consistent voice in communication, while also tailoring the 
tone and content to specific audiences - be it financial market analysts, other expert 
audiences, or the wider public.
Moreover, AI supports a wide range of multilingual and accessibility needs. Machine 
translation models - fine-tuned for economic and legal language - help ensure timely 
publication of central bank materials across multiple official languages, a feature very 
useful to the European System of Central Banks which speaks all 24 official languages 
of the EU.
Recourse to AI for communication purposes, however, necessitates caution. Over-
reliance on AI in crafting and interpreting central bank communications could create an 
"echo chamber." This would occur when AI tools respond to, and amplify, each other's 
outputs, leading to overly uniform narratives and repetitive signals, that may distort the 
policymakers' message. This is a clear case that illustrates the need for human 
oversight in overviewing processes to ensure that communication stays varied, 
accurate, and relevant.

Opportunity to improve central bank economic analysis and decision 
making
Another area that AI is poised to enhance is economic analysis. Following the AI 
revolution, we have started to build expertise in incorporating AI and non-traditional 
data in our analytical tools. These tools are rapidly being applied in the economic 
analyses that inform our monetary policy decisions.
A question however arises: Is the use of AI in this context a hype? Or could it mark a 
methodological revolution that will help us better pursue our mandate? I believe that 
there are unique opportunities but also several challenges.
First, central banks rely heavily on economic data to make informed decisions on 
monetary policy. Traditional statistical methods may not be sufficient to apprehend the 
complexity of the current uncertain environment. The use of LLMs can deliver enhanced 
data processing and analysis of unstructured data sets of textual data (like news 
articles or social media). This enables us to access new and non-traditional data 
sources, that could provide useful insights into our policies.
Furthermore, machine learning (ML) models can quickly detect patterns, trends, and 
potential risks that might not be visible using traditional methods. Thus, we could 
identify structural breaks and patterns that would otherwise be difficult to detect.
These tools can also help identify non-linear relationships. This is particularly important 
in a complex environment, since capturing non-linearities in the data is essential to 
understanding how the economy will evolve under stress and how seemingly small 
disturbances could lead to large-scale economic disruptions.
In addition, by processing real-time data, AI can provide timely insights and rigorous 
analysis, allowing central banks more flexibility in decision making. This is valuable in a 
world prone to shocks and in times of pervasive uncertainty.
There is also a possibility that these tools will be useful in the prediction of turning 
points in the business cycle and of tail events, such as fiscal crises.
Finally, AI could improve forecasting and nowcasting inflation and economic activity. 
The Eurosystem already uses AI to improve its forecasting processes. For example, ML 
techniques are applied in inflation forecastingor in nowcasting global trade.2  3  
Moreover, short-term forecasts of economic activity are informed by sentiment 
indicators derived from the textual analysis of news, using LLMs. Researchat the 4 5 
Bank of Greece has produced forecasting models of inflation based on textual 
indicators of supply and demand disturbances in commodity markets. With the help of 
AI tools, these indicators can be updated on a daily basis and thus help predict inflation 
more accurately. This research has found that out-of-sample inflation forecast errors 
are reduced by up to 30 per cent.
Still, there are several challenges.

5/9 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
First, AI models are often complex and opaque, lacking transparency. Being like a 
"black box", they are – at least for the time being - difficult to reconcile with the 
principles of transparency and accountability of central banks.
Second, AI models (usually LLMs) could occasionally provide inaccurate or misleading 
information, raising practical, reputational and legal concerns. Therefore, human 
supervision is of the essence, especially in processes that require rational reasoning.
Third, the quality of non-traditional data is often poor and the process of reconciling 
these data with our existing data sources is demanding. In a similar vein, the use of AI 
should not create an over-reliance on machine-driven outcomes.
Overall, I believe that AI is a potent technology which has already brought about 
tectonic shifts in economic analysis. Its potential is still unfolding, and the benefits it 
offers are only beginning to be realised. The cutting-edge research promoted at this 
conference marks a point of methodological revolution. I believe that such research will 
fundamentally transform the way we understand economic dynamics and will ultimately 
enable us to make better-informed decisions.
While AI opens unique opportunities for central banks in the pursuit of their mandate, it 
also brings a number of emerging implications that we must carefully consider. I'd like 
to share what I see as some of the most significant.
Implications on productivity, employment, inflation
Let me start with the effects on the macroeconomic outlook.
AI has strong potential to raise productivity, both through its direct impact on total factor 
productivity, but also through improvements of efficiency on individual firm level. 
However, the aggregate effects remain uncertain and vary widely across studies.6
One reason is that a disproportionate share of the benefits generated by AI may be 
concentrated in a small number of highly advanced firms, particularly large technology 
companies with the resources and infrastructure to develop and deploy cutting-edge AI 
tools.
This concentration poses a risk: while AI can deliver substantial productivity benefits at 
the enterprise level, these gains may not necessarily translate into broad-based growth 
in aggregate productivity, unless mechanisms are in place to ensure that the diffusion of 
AI is wide across sectors, firms and countries.
In a similar vein, the potential impact of AI on employment is difficult to estimate. On the 
one hand, it can automate routine, lower-skilled tasks - potentially displacing workers. 
On the other hand, AI can create new opportunities by increasing labour demand for 
non-automated tasks, as well as giving rise to new types of jobs. To maximise the 
favourable effects of AI on employment and to mitigate risks such as labour market 
inequality, reskilling the workforce with AI-complementary skills will be essential.

6/9 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Turning to prices, the impact of AI on inflation could go in both directions. Increased 
global demand for energy - driven by the computational intensity of AI technologies - 
could raise energy prices. According to the IMF, electricity used by data centres alone, 7
is already as much as that of Germany or France, and by 2030 would be comparable to 
that of India which is the world's third largest electricity user. At the same time, AI can 
also contribute to more efficient energy use and improved grid management, potentially 
lowering costs.
Moreover, AI-induced productivity improvements might help offset labour shortages, 
especially in times of low unemployment and ageing population. This could lead to a 
decline in unit labour costs, exerting thus downward price pressures. However, the 
overall impact of AI on employment and wage growth is difficult to predict.
Expectations also play a central role in the price formation process. If consumers fully 
anticipate future benefits from AI (such as better products, lower costs, or higher 
wages), they may bring forward consumption in the short term, creating inflationary 
pressures. However, if expectations are only regressively formed, disinflationary forces 
may dominate in the near term due to delayed consumption and investment.
Implications for monetary policy transmission
The transmission of monetary policy to the economy, and thus monetary policy making 
are significantly impacted by AI.
As I already noted, AI is expected to bring about distributional shifts in income and 
wealth. These shifts matter for monetary policy, since they influence households' 
marginal propensity to consume and their access to credit.
Should AI disproportionally raise the income share of lower-income households - with a 
higher marginal propensity to consume and greater credit constraints - the transmission 
of monetary policy could be strengthened. In contrast, if the gains accrue mainly to 
higher-income, more skilled households - who have lower marginal propensity to 
consume and are less responsive to interest rate changes -- then monetary policy 
transmission may weaken.
AI is also affecting how firms set prices. Companies that are more digitalised and 
employ algorithmic pricing tools can adjust prices more frequently and with greater 
precision in response to economic shocks. Higher price flexibility could induce – all else 
equal, a more efficient real economy.
At the same time, ML tools enable firms to personalise prices and introduce 
heterogeneity, which is likely to weaken the link between monetary policy measures 
and prices, although AI could provide tools that enhance price transparency and 
improve consumers' ability to compare prices. There is also the risk that algorithmic 
pricing could lead to tacit collusion among firms and greater market power, undermining 
the effectiveness of monetary policy in controlling inflation.
Finally, AI may influence wage-setting dynamics. If the presence of automation erodes 
workers' bargaining power, wage responsiveness to changes in unemployment could 

7/9 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
be reduced. This would weaken the sensitivity of inflation to shifts in monetary policy 
and complicate central banks' ability to steer inflation effectively.
Implications for financial stability
Turning now to financial stability, the implications of AI technologies are complex and 
multifaceted.
On the one hand, AI offers powerful tools to enhance financial institutions' capabilities in 
risk assessment, liquidity management and strategic decision making. On the other 
hand, AI can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and create new ones.
For example, generative AI could be deliberately misused - such as through the 
creation of deepfakes or fabricated statements - potentially aimed at manipulating 
sentiment or triggering market stress.
There is also the risk of herding behavior. As more institutions adopt similar AI models, 
the likelihood of systemic stress increases. What may initially appear as isolated, micro-
level risk could rapidly escalate via AI and pose serious threats to financial stability.
If financial institutions, market participants or the public at large base their key decisions 
on such inputs, without adequate human verification, we may witness situations of 
disorderly market volatility. Overreliance to a limited number of AI providers could 
further raise operational risks and adversely affect the resilience of the financial sector.
Therefore, it is critical that these tools are deployed with caution. Sound governance, 
robust regulatory oversight, and adequate safeguards will be essential to ensuring that 
AI acts as a tool for strength, rather than a source of systemic risk.
Conclusion
To conclude, the core task of central banks remains safeguarding price and financial 
stability, and AI poses unprecedented opportunities but also considerable challenges.
From enhancing communication and improving economic analysis, to reshaping the 
channels through which monetary policy and the financial system operate, AI is already 
redefining the way we pursue our tasks.
As I have outlined today, AI can make central banks more agile, more transparent, and 
more effective. But its use also demands flexibility - not only in the tools we use, but in 
the way we think, plan and make decisions. In a world of growing complexity and rapid 
technological change, we must ensure that innovation goes hand in hand with 
responsibility, transparency, and trust.
This calls for thoughtful integration, not blind adoption. As we integrate AI into our 
policymaking, we must ensure that human judgment and critical thinking remain central 
to our decisions. AI should serve as a tool to enhance - not replace - our responsibility 
to make sound, efficient policy choices in the interest of our citizens.

8/9 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The euro area faces a dual challenge: harnessing the opportunities that artificial 
intelligence presents while actively addressing its broader implications.
To rise to this challenge, it is vital that we craft a comprehensive European AI strategy. 
To improve the environment for AI innovation and diffusion of new technologies, our 
strategy has to rest on three pillars: funding, regulation and energy.
Developing and scaling AI requires substantial investment, particularly in digital 
infrastructure. There is broad consensus on the importance of building a savings and 
investment union to jump-start European projects on innovation, including AI.
Complementary efforts to equip people with the skills they need to thrive in an AI-driven 
economy and to mitigate the risk of widening inequality are also of high importance.
In addition, regulatory burdens and weak institutional quality can significantly hold back 
the expansion of high-tech sectors. That's why we need simple but efficient regulation, 
while ensuring protection of personal data and strong institutions to defend AI-
generated innovation.
Energy, too, is a critical piece of the puzzle. AI diffusion across the economy will place 
greater demands on Europe's energy infrastructure. Addressing supply constraints now 
is essential to ensuring that AI adoption is sustainable in the long run.
All these considerations need to be taken into account when assessing challenges and 
opportunities arising from this very innovative technology. The successful adoption of AI 
requires a flexible adjustment in a constantly evolving environment. Therefore, we need 
to commence our journey on that potentially wonderful vessel with urgency but also with 
careful consideration, towards a new shore.
I am confident that the insights shared at this conference, and the research being 
pursued by many of you in this room, will be instrumental in guiding us forward.
Thank you.
