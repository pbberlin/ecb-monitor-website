Piero Cipollone: Innovating for stability - central bank money in the 
digital era
Welcome address by Mr Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the 
European Central Bank, at an event hosted by the Deutsche Bundesbank for central 
bank representatives attending the Sibos conference, Frankfurt am Main, 30 September 
2025.

Almost exactly one year ago, I gave a speech – also here at the Bundesbank – outlining 
a vision for the future of digital finance and the role of central bank money in this new 
ecosystem.1
Fast forward 12 months, and the pace of transformation seems to have quickened even 
more. Innovative digital payment solutions and digital assets are receiving increasing 
attention, with market participants scrambling to position themselves favourably to 
ensure they do not miss out. The opportunities and risks are being discussed at length.2
So what does this mean for central banks? Today, I will argue that we need to innovate 
to keep central bank money at the technological frontier so that it can continue to act as 
an anchor of trust and stability for the financial system. I will also discuss the 
implications for retail, wholesale and cross-border payments.
Keeping central bank money at the forefront of technology to 
preserve its role as an anchor of trust and stability
Our vision has not changed: central bank money must remain the anchor of trust and 
stability at the heart of the financial system. In retail transactions, cash provides 
immediate and risk-free settlement directly between the payer and the payee. In 
wholesale markets, settlement in central bank money eliminates counterparty risk and 
provides finality in large-value transactions. In both cases, trust in private money relies 
on its convertibility with central bank money.
In other words, central bank money is the glue that holds the singleness and unity of 
our currency in place and secures the integrity of our financial system. And as finance 
becomes increasingly digital and new technologies emerge, we must adapt to ensure 
that central bank money remains reliable and available. This is the only way we can 
stay true to our mandate of issuing central bank money – the only risk-free settlement 
asset – and ensure that payment systems function smoothly. It will also encourage 
digital innovation and keep it safe.
I know that many of you share the Eurosystem's vision and – like us – are working hard 
to make it a reality. For central bank money to keep its stabilising and unifying role in 
the future of finance and payments, it must stay at the forefront of technology. This is 
the pre-condition for preserving the balance between public and private money that has 
served us well until now.

Implications for retail, wholesale and cross-border payments
Within the Eurosystem, we have considered the implications of the digital 
transformation for our own role in retail, wholesale and cross-border payments.
Retail payments
With everyday retail payments becoming increasingly digital, the role of physical central 
bank money – cash – is being reduced, creating risks to competition, inclusion, 
resilience and monetary sovereignty. And for the euro area, the risk to integration is 
particularly concerning – cash as the legal tender has always provided a means of 
payment that can be used everywhere across our monetary union. This is why we are 
working on a digital euro.3
But we have not forgotten about banknotes: we are still working on making them safer, 
more durable and more accessible. We are redesigning them to ensure they remain 
relatable. And we are advocating a strengthening of their legal tender status to ensure 
they continue to be widely accepted.4
Wholesale payments
The starting point for wholesale payments is different, because central bank money 
already exists in digital form and plays a central role. In the euro area, T2 is used to 
settle over 90% of the value of large payments between financial institutions. TARGET2-
Securities has harmonised securities settlement in central bank money across borders. 
And the new Eurosystem Collateral Management System has just gone live, providing a 
harmonised platform for collateral operations across the euro area. We are also 
preparing for the move to T+1 settlement by 2027 to reduce counterparty risk, and are 
learning from the experiences of those of you who have already done so.
Our challenge today is to preserve the centrality of central bank money for wholesale 
settlement as new technologies emerge. Not because we are selfishly or ideologically 
trying to protect our own role, but because we want to avoid reintroducing credit risk or 
liquidity fragmentation into the system. As we are being told by market participants 
themselves, this is crucial for digital asset markets to develop confidently and safely. It 
is also in keeping with the principles for financial market infrastructures.5
Although the full potential and limits of these new technologies – and thus the pace and 
magnitude of their adoption – remain uncertain, we cannot ignore them. If we take the 
film industry as an analogy, the switch from DVD to Blu-ray marked a significant 
improvement. However, as the internet became faster and more widely available, a true 
paradigm shift occurred: streaming emerged and more or less completely replaced 
physical media in providing access to digital content.
We cannot exclude that a similar shift might happen with the digitalisation of finance, 
Markets are already experimenting with tokenised securities and distributed ledger 
technologies (DLT), which promise efficiency gains, programmability and new 6
possibilities for integrating trading, settlement and custody services. But without the 
anchor of central bank money, these experiments risk creating new silos, new

dependencies and new vulnerabilities. That's why we want to ensure that central bank 
money remains available in this new environment, and in so doing prevent 
fragmentation that would strip this innovation of the benefits it offers.
A year ago I outlined my vision of how to respond to this challenge. Today, we are 
turning that vision into reality. The Eurosystem has successfully tested the settlement of 
wholesale transactions in central bank money using distributed ledger technology.We 7 
have now launched Project Pontes, which will provide a bridge between new DLT 
platforms and TARGET settlement services.A first release will be available in a year's 8 
time, allowing tokenised transactions to be settled in central bank money. We are also 
working on how to make digital assets deployable as collateral for our monetary policy 
operations.
We have also launched Project Appia, which will explore longer-term approaches for 
more efficient and integrated capital markets in Europe by leveraging distributed ledger 
technologies.Appia could offer a shared ledger integrating central bank money, 9 
commercial bank money and other assets for market services. Alternatively, it could 
take the form of a network of interoperable platforms to reduce market frictions and 
foster innovation. This could lay the foundation for a truly European digital capital 
markets union that would be integrated from the outset.
Cross-border payments
Beyond domestic payments, we are also increasingly called upon to take action when it 
comes to cross-border payments, which too often remain slow and expensive. By 
cooperating internationally, we can help deliver on the objectives of the G20 Roadmap10
in a way that is more respectful of the sovereignty and financial stability of our  
respective countries than some alternatives that might trigger currency substitution.11 
Many of us are already working on common projects, such as Project Agora steered by 
the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). This is a promising avenue that will 
nevertheless require time to get up and running. While working on this, we also need to 
provide quicker answers to satisfy customer and market needs. We can do so by 
sharing common platforms that allow for cross-currency settlement. This currently 
happens in the euro area, where other European countries such as Denmark and 
Sweden use these common platforms, with Norway also set to use them soon.12 
Alternatively, we can interlink our fast payment systems. For instance, the Eurosystem 
is exploring interlinking our TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system with 
those of other countries. We started exploring this option with Project Nexus and India's 
Unified Payments Interface.Similarly, we recently announced that we will start 13 
working with our Swiss colleagues to link our fast payments systems,and we are 14 
already discussing with other possible partners.
Conclusion
Our role as central banks has always been to provide the safest settlement asset at the 
core of the financial system. We have innovated constantly and must do so once again.

4/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Digitalisation and tokenisation are reshaping payments and finance. This is creating 
anxiety and a rush to find quick fixes. To avoid fragmentation, instability or resources 
being wasted, a steady hand is needed to provide a vision and outline the way forward.
As central banks, we have a key role to play: our task is to ensure and reassure 
markets that central bank money remains available, safe and efficient in this new 
environment, and will continue to fulfil its role in preserving financial stability and trust in 
our currencies.
Technology can help us achieve greater efficiency and resilience. If we succeed in 
using it to our advantage, we will have seized the moment, helping to maximise the 
opportunities and minimise the risks in the public's best interests.
