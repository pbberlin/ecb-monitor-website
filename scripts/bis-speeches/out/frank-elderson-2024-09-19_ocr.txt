SPEECH
The art of bending without breaking — banking
on operational resilience
Speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the
ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the
joint European Banking Authority and European Central Bank
international conference on “Addressing supervisory challenges
through enhanced collaboration”
Frankfurt, 4 September 2024
I’m delighted to see supervisors from all around the globe here with us in Frankfurt to exchange views
on some of the most pressing issues we face. The banks we supervise operate in an ever more
complex risk environment, marked by heightened climate and nature-related risks, increasingly
sophisticated cyberattacks and risks stemming from non-bank financial institutions — to name just a
few for discussion today. The common denominator of all these risks is that they affect all of us: from
Asia to the Americas, from Africa to Europe. To get a better grip on these risks enhanced international
cooperation is essential — and this conference is a testament to that.
In my remarks today, | will focus on a cornerstone of prudential supervisors’ mission to keep banks
sound: ensuring that banks build up and maintain adequate operational resilience.
Let me start with a small detour into the world of botany. In an environment subject to more extreme
weather conditions, certain tree species have proven particularly resilient to strong winds due to their
distinct characteristics. The silver birch, for instance, is known for its flexible branches and widespread
root system. These characteristics help it master the art of bending with the wind without breaking,
even under hurricane-like conditions.
The same resilience is needed in today’s risk landscape, swept by heightened operational headwinds
such as cyber incidents, technology disruptions and natural disasters: to master the art of bending
without breaking under such headwinds, banks must develop distinct characteristics.
Now, you might primarily associate a bank’s resilience with its financial strength — particularly given the
significant increases in capital and liquidity buffers following the post-crisis reforms. But I'll highlight
why financial resilience alone is far from sufficient to weather the storms brewing over today’s risk
landscape.
Consider the example of Amsterdam Trade Bank (ATB), which filed for bankruptcy although it had
ample capital and liquidity. What went wrong? Imagine the bank’s credit officers turning up at the office
one Friday morning in April 2022, trying to access their documents — and all they see on the screen is
that access is denied. Why?
Owing to sanctions ATB had lost access to its IT systems, which were run by third-party providers. As
a result, the bank couldn't provide banking services anymore. There weren’t adequate contingency


arrangements in place — because a scenario in which IT systems weren't operable had seemed too
unrealistic — and so the bank had to close shop.
In 2023 when the New York arm of an investment bank was hit by a ransomware attack, it literally sent
a runner with a USB stick across downtown Manhattan to help settle trades in the $25 trillion US
treasury market.
And most recently, the CrowdStrike incident caused the operating system of a major provider to crash,
displaying the so-called blue screen of death, leading to significant disruptions across sectors —
including at a few banks.4]
All these examples underscore a fundamental point: financial resilience alone is a necessary but not
sufficient condition to weather operational headwinds. You can have ample capital and liquidity but still
face major operational issues or even fail if you lack robust contingency planning for operational
shocks that are impossible to avoid. In other words, some banks were missing an essential safeguard
— operational resilience.
Operational resilience goes beyond capital and liquidity
While operational risk management aims to minimise the likelihood and impact of operational risks,
operational resilience assumes that disruptions will inevitably occur. Hence banks must protect
themselves from threats, and be able to respond to disruptive events, recover and learn from them in
order to be able to “deliver critical operations through disruption”2!
First the good news: regulators and supervisors have understood that merely scrutinising banks’
balance sheets with an eagle eye is not sufficient to probe banks’ resilience. As a result, operational
resilience has made it to the top of the supervisory agenda around the globe. 4!
For instance, operational resilience has now been engraved in the marble of supervision: the Basel
Core Principles. They now explicitly cover operational resilience, including enhanced requirements for
aspects ranging from governance and business continuity planning to third-party dependency
management. The revised Core Principles will help supervisors around the world to encourage
banks to increase their resilience to operational threats. Such threats are unlikely to decline given
heightened geopolitical, cyber, and climate and nature-related risks.
Moreover, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which will apply as of 17 January 2025 in the
EU, will help to further boost operational resilience. Among other things, DORA provides a robust
framework requiring banks to foster a culture of continuous IT and cyber risk management.
In the banking union, we flagged addressing deficiencies in banks’ operational resilience frameworks
as one of the SSM supervisory priorities for 2024-2026. This means, for instance, conducting on-site
inspections of banks’ cybersecurity management or targeted analysis of banks’ outsourcing
arrangements with third-party providers, including potential concentrations of risk in certain providers.
IT and cyber risks challenging banks’ operational resilience
One important factor challenging banks’ operational resilience is IT and cyber risk. This can have a
material financial, reputational and legal impact on banks. Cyberattacks can significantly disrupt banks’


critical functions and services, such as providing credit or processing payments, and hence damage
the trust in the banking system.
According to the International Monetary Fund, cyberattacks have almost doubled since before the
COVID-19 pandemic. This is reflected in the number of significant cyber incidents reported to the
ECB too, which almost doubled from 2022 to 2023.!4 Worryingly, the attacks have not only increased
in number but also in sophistication.
In order to help banks pinpoint their vulnerabilities to cyber risks, earlier this year we conducted a
cyber resilience stress test.[5l It wasn’t a stress test in the traditional sense, with capital impact.
Instead, it was a qualitative exercise aimed at encouraging banks to better understand how well they
would be able to respond to and recover from a successful cyberattack while maintaining their critical
functions and services.
The cyber resilience stress test showed that, although banks do have high-level response and
recovery frameworks in place, there is room for improvement.
Banks need to ensure that their recovery capabilities are sufficient to handle even worst-case
scenarios, and that they can protect customers’ assets and data, and in doing so maintain confidence
in the banking system.
We are therefore calling on banks to prioritise operational and cyber resilience and ensure that this
resilience is integrated into their core business strategies. This will enable them to adapt and respond
proactively to the fast-paced changes in the cyber threat landscape.
Cloud outsourcing risk
Let me now turn to another key challenge for banks’ operational resilience that warrants closer
attention — their use of cloud services.
While there are undoubtedly benefits associated with banks steadily increasing their use of cloud
services in recent years, there are also risks. This is why the Basel Committee stresses that
“regulatory interventions are needed to address the risks arising from cloud adoption.” But what
exactly are these risks?
We only have to look back to May this year to find a good example. A misconfiguration at a major
cloud service provider erased the equivalent of €82 billion of clients’ money from a pension fund,
making the accounts of more than half a million customers inaccessible for a week. This incident
shows that if an organisation can’t easily replace outsourced services during a failure, its functioning
may be severely affected. Hence if you outsource functions to a service provider you also need to ask
whether the service provider has the same risk controls in place as if that service were provided in-
house. To get a better insight into risk controls at cloud service providers, European banking
supervision has started conducting on-site inspections of some of these providers.
Another issue is concentration risk. The Bank of England has estimated that more than 70% of banks
and 80% of insurers rely on just two cloud service providers. Ultimately, the failure of either of these
providers could have a significant negative impact on markets and consumers, and on financial


stability. This level of concentration implies that operational incidents may become more correlated
among financial institutions that outsource critical functions to a common critical service provider.
An emerging challenge in the digital financial landscape is the blurring of lines between policy areas.
Prudential supervisors would be well advised to coordinate with other supervisory authorities, such as
competition authorities, to understand the dynamic market forces at play. Coordination is crucial for
ensuring that the drive towards digitalisation, which may result in an increase in market concentration,
does not undermine financial stability.
Concerning banks under ECB supervision, we found room for improvement in their cloud outsourcing
strategies. We acted on this by publishing for public consultation a guide that sets out our supervisory
expectations and provides recommendations on the outsourcing of cloud services. Importantly, the
guide also outlines specific good practices that banks can use as a basis for tackling cloud outsourcing
risk. “21
Clearly, cloud outsourcing risk doesn’t stop at national borders; it affects multiple jurisdictions. We've
therefore teamed up with other prudential authorities to conduct a joint review into cloud outsourcing
practices. This will enable us to better understand how banks are adopting cloud technology and the
risks it may pose. For instance, we’re collectively exploring banks’ third-party risk management
practices and their business continuity plans, as well as their exit strategies — including stressed exits.
Bolstering operational resilience requires investment
So how can banks strengthen their operational resilience? In contrast to financial resilience,
operational resilience cannot be bolstered by accumulating additional basis points of Common Equity
Tier 1. Rather, mastering the art of bending without breaking under operational headwinds requires
multi-year investment in capability-building. We know that you should put your house in order in good
times so that you are well prepared for bad times. Given the current uptick in banks’ profitability, the
time is right for banks to continue investing in building their operational resilience.
This means, for instance, replacing legacy systems with state-of-the-art IT infrastructure, including in
the areas of IT risk management and cyber hygiene, as well as ensuring that business continuity plans
and third-party dependency management are implemented consistently.
Importantly, operational resilience-building is not only a matter of systems and processes — it is also
about people. Investment in human capital is therefore essential. Banks must ensure that employees
at all levels of the organisation have the appropriate skillset, whether they are experts or managers.
Soberingly, from our analysis of the effectiveness of banks’ management bodies we can see that there
are still boards that lack in-depth IT expertise, which may ultimately put into question the collective
suitability of the board.3] We expect all boards to have a sound understanding of IT and cyber risks
so that they can assess the impact of these risks on banks’ various business areas.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
The novelist Max Frisch once said: “Crisis is a productive state. You just have to take away the
aftertaste of disaster’. Shocks stemming from cyber incidents or cloud outsourcing and IT risks are an


opportunity for banks to further bolster their resilience — to nurture their capacity to bend without
breaking.
Financial resilience alone is far from sufficient to weather operational headwinds — you need
operational resilience. And in order to bolster and maintain operational resilience banks must continue
investing in future-proof systems, processes and people. This is not a steady state exercise.
Operational resilience demands continuous attention and must keep pace with the changing risk
environment.
As | have highlighted, no jurisdiction is immune to operational shocks. All of us will be affected by them
at some point.
Let’s therefore share good practices and use cases from our supervisory work.
Let’s reinforce policy and supervisory coordination across both jurisdictions and sectors.
And let’s strengthen communication channels to enable us to coordinate closely when shocks hit.
Thank you for your attention.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) defines operational resilience as follows: “the
ability of a bank to deliver critical operations through disruption. This ability enables a bank to identify
and protect itself from threats and potential failures, respond and adapt to, as well as recover and
learn from disruptive events in order to minimise their impact on the delivery of critical operations
through disruption. In considering its operational resilience, a bank should assume that disruptions will
occur, and take into account its overall risk appetite and tolerance for disruption.” See paragraph 11 of
the BCBS principles for operational resilience.

In 2024 supervisors from around the world revised the Core Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision, which were first published in 1997 and last updated in 2012. The Core Principles are one
of the most important sets of global supervisory standards, establishing comprehensive requirements


for both supervisors and banks. See also Elderson, F. (2024), “Updating the Magna Carta of

For instance, it is good practice to have multiple data centres in different geographical locations.
Banks should also have exit strategies in place — with clearly defined roles, responsibilities and cost
estimates — for all outsourced cloud services linked to critical functions. And banks should also assess
concentration risks to a specific provider, geographical location and functionality.

For instance, 17% of banks do not have a management body member with more than five years of ICT
experience. See Elderson, F. (2024), “Banks’ governance and risk culture a decade on: progress and
shortcomings”, The Supervision Blog, 24 July. To ensure diversity of skills and collective suitability, for
instance, we expect at least one non-executive member of the management body to have a minimum
of five years of recent and specific knowledge and experience in the field of ICT and security risk
management. See ECB Banking Supervision (2024), “New policy for more bank board expertise on
ICT and security risks”, Supervision Newsletter, ECB, 21 February.
