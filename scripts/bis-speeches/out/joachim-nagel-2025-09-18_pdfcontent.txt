1 Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to open the thirteenth regulatory 
conference. A warm welcome, too, to our speakers and panellists. 
To kick off my speech today, I would like to take you on a brief excursion into the world 
of medicine. For a long time, hospitals striving to lower the number of deaths from 
infectious diseases used to deploy a whole host of measures: regularly airing the 
rooms, frequently changing the bed covers, isolating patients, and giving doctors 
special protective clothing to wear. 
Then, in the mid-19th century, a Hungarian physician called Ignaz Semmelweis 
introduced a simple rule: All doctors and medical students were to wash their hands 
with a chlorinated solution before every examination. The results were spectacular: The 
mortality rate dropped within the space of a few months from more than ten per cent to 
less than three per cent. 
The solution to the problem I will be talking about in just a moment is certainly not quite 
as simple, and the effect might be smaller as well. But you can probably tell what I'm 
getting at: Sometimes, a simple, yet appropriate solution to a problem is better suited 
than a complex bundle of measures. 
Today's European banking regulation is just such a complex bundle of measures. It 
sets out to achieve different objectives, relying on a multitude of instruments that are 
often intertwined. Banking regulation in its current form came into being in a long and 
iterative process. New capital instruments were introduced, minimum requirements 
were raised, and additional capital buffers were created. Further requirements were 
added–like the leverage ratio–alongside new resolution rules.
The outcome: Our banking system today is far more resilient than it was prior to the 
2007 global financial crisis. We have seen compelling evidence of this in recent years: 
Neither the coronavirus pandemic nor the energy crisis, nor the turmoil in the US
 banking market in 2023, spelled any serious danger for the European banking system.
In terms of resilience, then, the European banking system has delivered in every 
respect imaginable. That's unreservedly positive. And it's something that's worth 
stressing over and again. But an honest stocktake also means acknowledging that 
banking regulation today is more complex than it ever was. 

2/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Just over six months ago, I joined my ECB  Governing Council colleagues José Luis 
Escrivá (Banco de España), Fabio Panetta (Banca d'Italia) and François Villeroy de 
Galhau (Banque de France) in writing a letter to Maria Luís Albuquerque, the European 
Commissioner responsible for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments 
Union.1 In that letter, we called on the European Commission to widen its simplification 
initiative to also include the banking sector. In the Eurosystem, we are now working on 
this topic as part of a High-Level Task Force.2
I will begin my speech by briefly outlining what exactly is meant by the term 
"simplification"–and what is not. After that, I will give you an idea of the complexity of 
the existing own funds regulation in Europe and explain why this can lead to 
inefficiencies. I will then close my speech by explaining, with the aid of four concrete 
thought-provoking impulses, how effective banking regulation could be simplified.
2 What does simplification mean?
Let me start with the question of what simplification means exactly–and what it doesn't. 
I think it's important to emphasise that simplification in banking regulation is not 
synonymous with deregulation. What we want to avoid at all costs is a potential 
situation where we jeopardise the stability of the banking system or underestimate risks.
Rather, simplification stands for a targeted reduction of unnecessary or perhaps even 
counterproductive complexity. In other words, we are striving to make regulation 
clearer, more understandable and more efficient–while continuing to safeguard the 
stability of the banking system. True to the motto: as simple as possible, as complex as 
necessary.
One vivid example of simplification can be found in the area of disclosure requirements 
and reporting standards. At the European and national levels, there are already 
numerous initiatives aimed at eliminating reporting overlaps and at streamlining and 
harmonising reporting requirements. One concrete example is the joint initiative with 
BaFin to discontinue the reporting scheme for loans of €1 million or more at the end of 
2026. For that to happen, the necessary legal amendments will have to have been 
made by then. 
But there are other fields of banking regulation, too, where it's worth exploring the topic 
of simplification. Because today's banking regulation is the result of multiple reforms 
that were often rolled out in response to specific crises and new challenges. Those 
reforms had to take different interests and objectives into account. Every single 
measure had a good reason for existing.
But over time, these have grown to become an ever more dense mesh of regulations. 
Many rules are intertwined, some overlap, others are difficult to understand or arduous 
to implement. That's not to fault the legislators–rather, it is the outcome of a long and 
complicated process of negotiations.
That is why we at the Bundesbank asked ourselves: What would optimal banking 
regulation look like if we had the opportunity to rewrite it today entirely from scratch? 
Even things that work well need to be evaluated at regular intervals–that's neither 
unusual nor reprehensible. In monetary policy, incidentally, that's something we do as a 

3/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
matter of course. Just recently, we conducted another assessment of our monetary 
policy strategy. And an approach that has proven its worth in monetary policy can 
benefit banking regulation as well.
3 Own funds regulation: the status quo
How does the complexity of European banking regulation manifest itself–and what 
unintended side effects can it have? I'd like to spend some time focusing on own funds 
regulation. It's a good example of the complexity that I'm talking about.
Nowadays, European banks are faced with a plethora of parallel own funds 
requirements. These requirements pertain to the capital regime and to the resolution 
regime. The capital regime governs the amount and type of own funds a bank has to 
hold on a going concern basis. The aim is to safeguard the solvency and stability of the 
bank in its day-to-day operations and to cushion losses from ongoing business.
The capital regime incorporates four key capital requirements, three of which are risk-
weighted and one of which is unweighted. Risk-weighted means that assets are 
weighted differently depending on their risk content. A collateralised loan to a reliable 
debtor is thus assigned a smaller risk weight than an unsecured loan to a risky debtor. 
Weighting is a way of more precisely capturing credit risk. 
Banks need to meet three requirements for their risk-weighted assets–for common 
equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital and total own funds. Let's make these 
terms–that are perhaps a little abstract to some–more tangible. Common equity tier 1 
capital includes, for example, shares issued by the bank or retained earnings. This form 
of capital is the best at absorbing losses. Contingent convertible bonds, also known as 
CoCo bonds, are an important instrument when it comes to additional tier 1 capital. 
They are automatically converted from debt to equity if specific trigger events occur. 
Tier 2 capital primarily includes subordinated liabilities.
Banks are also required to comply with a leverage ratio. In simple terms, this involves 
measuring tier 1 capital in relation to total assets–without risk weighting.3 The leverage 
ratio curbs banks' debt and provides an additional layer of protection alongside the risk-
weighted capital requirements.
If a bank is being wound up–i.e. in the case of a "gone concern"–the resolution regime 
contains further requirements. The aim here is to enable even banks whose insolvency 
could jeopardise financial stability to be wound up in an orderly manner–without placing 
a burden on the taxpayer.
The resolution regime governs the way this should work in Europe. The minimum 
requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) is one element of it. Again, it 
includes both risk-weighted and unweighted components. To meet the requirements 
imposed by the resolution regime, banks are permitted to use not only equity capital but 
also certain instruments of debt capital. Global, systemically important institutions are 
also subject to international standards such as total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC).
All in all, large banks in Europe have to meet up to nine different own funds 
requirements. We have a number of different requirements side by side, so we're 

4/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
talking about horizontal complexity here. On top of that, there's also vertical complexity, 
with these requirements consisting, in turn, of multiple stacked layers. 
All European banks must meet certain minimum requirements–that's the first layer. 
Then, there are various capital buffers to be met in the second layer. Looking at risk-
weighted capital requirements, these include the capital conservation buffer, the buffer 
for systemically important institutions, the countercyclical capital buffer and the systemic 
risk buffer. In some cases, minimum requirements and buffers are the same across all 
banks, and in others they are bank-specific or country-specific–and they can change 
over time, too. Pillar 2 guidance creates a third layer, in the form of an additional capital 
reserve recommended by supervisors. And the resolution regime consists of multiple 
layers as well. 
If your mind's already in overdrive, you wouldn't be alone–many banks and financial 
investors feel the same. The complexity becomes problematic if it leads to inefficiencies 
or if the individual elements get in each other's way. I'd now like to briefly highlight two 
key problem areas.
First, the multitude of capital requirements makes it difficult for banks, supervisors and 
market participants to readily work out which requirement is binding in a given case. 
That's because the answer to that question will depend on many factors–the capital 
structure and the buffers available, to name a couple. 
Second, there are a number of side effects and interactions that can undermine the 
actual objectives behind the rules. For instance, double counting of own funds towards 
buffers and parallel minimum requirements reduce the buffers available for use. And 
this, in turn, can lead to a situation where supervisors release buffers but banks cannot 
actually use them. This problem is already well documented.4
Another example is that large banks often meet some of their requirements with 
additional tier 1 capital, such as contingent convertible bonds. As a result, they have 
less common equity tier 1 capital to cushion losses.
Crisis measures have different trigger points and this discrepancy can also prove 
problematic. From a capital regime perspective, it makes sense to set the trigger point 
as late as possible, as this would ensure that banks also use their buffers and maintain 
lending. From a resolution angle, however, this might then leave insufficient capital to 
facilitate orderly resolution. 
As you can see, complex regulation leads to undesirable side effects in some 
cases–which undermines the actual purpose of regulation.
4 Possible areas of action
How could we significantly reduce the complexity of own funds regulation? I would like 
to present four thought-provoking impulses to achieve this.
4.1 Reduce the number of own funds requirements

5/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
A first approach would be to reduce the number of own funds requirements. Changes 
could be made to the capital regime so that only common equity tier 1 capital would be 
eligible. This would already halve the number of parallel requirements for banks in a 
going concern scenario. That would leave one risk-weighted requirement and one 
unweighted requirement for common equity tier 1 capital.
In the case of additional tier 1 capital, in particular, there have been doubts for years as 
to whether it can actually absorb losses as intended in a going concern scenario.[5] And 
the international experience of the past few years also shows that, in crises, additional 
tier 1 capital often only absorbs losses when the bank is already on the verge of failure.
[6] If banks were to consistently rely on common equity tier 1 capital instead, banks' 
loss-absorbing capacity on a going concern basis would be significantly strengthened. 
This is because common equity tier 1 capital covers losses without constraints and is 
not subject to repayment or conversion. In addition, this would make the capital regime 
much clearer and less complex.
4.2 Separate capital and resolution regimes more clearly from each other
A second approach would be to separate the capital regime and the resolution regime 
more clearly from each other. To this end, in the resolution regime, for each risk-
weighted and unweighted requirement we could allow only those instruments that do 
not form part of common equity tier 1 capital under the capital regime–i.e. additional tier 
1 capital, tier 2 capital and subordinated liabilities. 
These would then only be eligible in the resolution regime. That way, the funds 
earmarked for resolution would remain unaffected by losses in normal business 
operations and really would be available in the event of a crisis. This is because even if 
common equity tier 1 capital offers the best loss-absorbing capacity, it may already be 
largely depleted in the case of a resolution due to double counting in the capital and 
resolution regimes.
Clearly separating the capital and resolution regimes would have another advantage: 
The requirements would no longer overlap. This would allow banks to use their capital 
buffers at any time without at the same time violating a minimum requirement. 
The complexity of the resolution regime could be further reduced by allowing only 
subordinated liabilities. Instruments such as senior bonds could therefore no longer be 
used to cover the requirements. This would facilitate effective resolution, as 
subordinated instruments can be written off or converted into equity in a targeted 
manner. And this without any undesirable side effects on the financial system. 
4.3 Pool capital buffers
A third approach would be to pool the various capital buffers. The aim here is not to 
undermine the existing division of tasks between European and national supervisory 
authorities. It's about simplifying regulation within the existing competences. 
One of several options would be to combine the countercyclical capital buffer and the 
systemic risk buffer from national macroprudential supervision to form a single, 

6/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
releasable buffer. In periods of stress, it could then be flexibly released by supervisors 
and used by banks. If supervisors release the buffer during a period of stress, banks' 
own funds requirements fall. And this helps them to continue lending to enterprises and 
households.
4.4 Introduce a small bank regime
My fourth approach is that for small banks, the own funds requirements could be 
simplified even more strongly. In many areas, small banks are already subject to the 
principle of proportionality. Proportionality in banking regulation means that supervisory 
requirements depend on banks' size, business model, complexity and risk profile. The 
aim is to avoid imposing the same extensive regulations on smaller and less complex 
institutions as on large, international banks.
However, the capital requirements that currently apply to small banks in Europe are 
similarly complex to those of large banks. In the capital regime, there is therefore still 
considerable potential to strengthen proportionality. This is because the complex 
requirements of the risk-based regime, with their exceptions and special rules, pose 
major challenges for small banks.
Inspiration for simplification can be found in Switzerland, for example. There, small 
banks can voluntarily opt for a regime in which the risk-weighted requirements no 
longer apply.[7] This would be worth considering for small, less complex and low-risk 
banks in the EU, too. This would eliminate the time-consuming calculation and 
documentation of risk-weighted assets, as well as many reporting and disclosure 
requirements. In return, the leverage ratio, i.e. the requirement for tier 1 capital in 
relation to unweighted assets, would be increased accordingly.[8] The exact level of the 
leverage ratio would still have to be determined.
On balance, the complexity of small banks' capital requirements would decrease 
significantly, but their resilience would remain intact. So here, too, simplification does 
not mean deregulation, but simpler yet effective regulation.
Taken together, the proposed measures could significantly reduce the complexity of 
European banking regulation and reduce undesirable side effects. All this without 
jeopardising the stability of the banking system. They might perhaps even further 
increase it.
5 Conclusion
Ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of my speech, I spoke about the doctor Ignaz 
Semmelweis. Although his simple hand-washing measure was a resounding success, it 
was not immediately welcomed by all his colleagues. However, the importance of hand 
hygiene ultimately prevailed worldwide and is now considered one of the most 
important and simplest measures for preventing infections.
And when it comes to reducing the complexity of banking regulation, too, we still have 
some persuading to do. This is because it is often intuitively assumed that a complex 

7/8 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
issue such as the stability of banks can only be tackled with equally complex regulation. 
But if I have been able to convince you of one thing today, then hopefully of the 
following: it is worth critically questioning the complexity of our banking regulation.
Recognising the problem is mostly quite simple–finding the optimal solution, by 
contrast, is often much more difficult. I have already presented a number of specific 
ideas to you today. Let me briefly summarise these again:
First, we could make common equity tier 1 capital the only eligible capital in the capital 
regime. This would halve the number of own funds requirements.
Second, we could restrict eligibility in the resolution regime to instruments that do not 
belong to common equity tier 1 capital. The requirements in the capital and resolution 
regime would thus be clearly separated.
Third, macroprudential capital buffers could be combined and designed in such a way 
that they can be released more easily and flexibly in the event of a crisis.
Fourth, the requirements could be simplified further for smaller, low-risk banks. Instead 
of complex, risk-weighted requirements, a higher, but uncomplicated leverage ratio 
would be preferable. 
One thing is clear: We are at the beginning of a long journey. The four ideas need to be 
further substantiated analytically and examined for possible side effects. In addition, 
many details would need to be carefully defined and thoroughly explored. 
With this speech, I would like to further advance the discussion with our national and 
European partners. For I am convinced that we should move forward boldly on this 
path. Simplification is feasible–true to the motto: as complex as necessary, as simple as 
possible. Thank you for your attention.
