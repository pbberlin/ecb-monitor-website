Mr President, Honourable Members 
Thank you for inviting me to appear before the Foreign Affairs Committee of our 
National Assembly today. This is an extraordinary event, and even a first  – 
although I do often speak before the Finance Committee. I would like to extend 
my sincere thanks to your President for this opportunity. It also reflects the new 
era we are entering, marked by the shift in American policy, global 
unpredictability and, I believe, “expectations of Europe”. These fractures are as 
significant in economic terms as they are in diplomatic terms; I will naturally 
focus on the former. However, I would like to dispel one common misconception 
right away: economic and financial reform is not merely technical in nature ; it 
also has an essential political sovereignty dimension (I). I would then like to 
address another concern: economic Europe is not condemned to remain stuck 
in its past inertia; it can and must seize this unique opportunity (II).  
I) Economic and financi al Europe: a political rather than a technical 
undertaking. 
1.1. The European challenge: transforming our economic and financial 
strengths into sovereignty 
France and Europe's challenge in terms of power in 2025 is clearly defence 
related, but it is just a s much about the economy. We cannot move forward 
sustainably with the former without achieving the latter. Europe certainly has 
economic strengths , but we neither have enough awareness nor enough 
confidence in these. Our single market is as big as that of the United States in 
terms of purchasing power parity ( EUR 17.9 trillion for the European Union 
compared with EUR 18.4 trillion for the United States in 2024 i). The European 
Union has an abundant resource: private financial savings that are increasing 
every year, representing a flow of EUR 1,085 billion (6% of GDP) last yearii. We 
have a highly skilled workforce – our continent has produced more than 500 
Nobel Prize winners – a firmly established rule of law and a shared social model. 
While the United St ates is unfortunately turning inwards and relinquishing its 
global leadership role, the European Union is expected to act as a possible 
stabilising force by our international partners.

But today we must transform these strengths into power. Our single mar ket is 
much less attractive than the US market, particularly for innovative companies, 
as it remains far too fragmented. Our financial savings surplus, although 
considerable (over EUR 400 billion last year iii), is partly intermediated by US 
finance and insufficiently channelled into European corporate equity financingiv. 
Transatlantic mobility remains highly imbalanced in the field of research: nearly 
120,000 European researchers currently work in the United States. As a result, 
Europe is lagging behind in the area of technology: too much private investment 
is flowing into existing sectors and not enough into innovative sectors. This is 
the ‘middle technology trap’ described by Jean Tirole, among others. v France 
has long been the leading and rightful advocate of this necessary European 
economic sovereignty, but it must now, unfortunately, restore its fiscal credibility 
if it wants to bring its partners fully on board. Ultimately, France must reduce its 
deficits and debt in order to regain influence in Europe. 
1.2 Europe has nevertheless managed to achieve trade and monetary 
sovereignty 
However, there are two areas where Europe, thanks to its unity, has managed 
to achieve sovereignty: trading power and monetary sovereignty. 
The European Union is now the world's largest trading power ,vi and it speaks 
with one voice through the Commission. The US protectionist measures are a 
‘lose-lose’ game, but one in which the initiator will pay the highest price:vii growth 
in the United States this year will be lower than was forecast in January, with 
higher inflation. The ‘agreements’ announce d in the last few days with the UK 
and then China, while less harsh than the brutal measures of 2 April, are not 
good agreements: there are still too many p enalising tariffs – including the 
unprecedented baseline tariff of 10%! – and, above all, there is still just as much 
vagueness and unpredictability, which is fuelling a wait -and-see attitude.  
Europeans have so far managed to remain calm and united: it is right to have 
tabled retaliatory measures, but they should be phased in gradually to allow for 
negotiations and hopefully de -escalation. Furthermore, Europe has every 
interest in forging trade alliances with a maximum number of other partners, 

Page 3 of 6 
 
from Latin America (including Mercosur) to Asia, provided such agreements are 
balanced. 
More than 25 years ago, we succeeded in building monetary sovereignty 
through the creation of the euro. It took political will and a method that mobilised 
all stakeholders. Recognised worldwide, it now gives us the autonomy we need 
in the face of America's  volatility. Remember how greatly our monetary policy 
decisions were influenced by US dollar policy  in the 1980s and 1990s? Today, 
they are entirely our own.  
Despite a highly uncertain international environment, the monetary situation in 
the euro area is now clearer. For the first time in several years, we have returned 
to what could be termed the "2-2" zone: inflation close to 2%, our target, and a 
key interest rate of 2.25%, well below the US viii and UKix rates of 4.25%. This 
success consolidates the historically high level of support among French and 
European citizens for the single currency, which stands at 81% in Europe.  
Given the uncertainty surrounding US financial assets and our partners' appetite 
for diversification, strengthening the international role of the euro may  become 
a strategic imperative. Admittedly, this role was not stipulated in the objectives 
of the European treaties, and when the euro was created, the Eurosystem 
adopted a neutral stance on the international ambitions of the euro. x However, 
on the 20th anniversary of the euro, the ECB xi emphasised the shift from a 
"neither/nor" approach ( i.e. neither hindering nor supporting) to a ‘happy 
coincidence’ between the Eurosystem's internal objectives and the external 
dimension of the euro. Naturally, the role of the dollar will remain important; the 
strengthening of the euro must therefore be a gradual and balanced process, 
based on the choices made by private players. But it also goes hand in hand 
with an internal opportunity: consolidating our common architecture – whether it 
be the Savings and Investments Union or offering safe euro -denominated 
assets.

II. Overcoming stupefaction to seize "Europe's moment” 
I will now come on to a second misconception: that European economic 
sovereignty is an impossible goal. Admittedly, this objective – which has existed 
alongside monetary union from the outset and has gained traction over the past 
15 years with plans for a Banking Union and a Capital Markets Union – is 
progressing too slowly. However, if there is one good thing about America’s 
policy shift, it is at least a wake-up call for Europe. But we do have to admit, our 
collective response is still not up to the task.  We have the ability to make this 
leap, provided we have the firm and lasting will to do so. The  formation of the 
new German government coincides with this window of opportunity.  
Setting a mobilising deadline for achieving economic and financial 
sovereignty 
The Draghi xii and Letta xiii reports in 2024, followed by the European 
Commission’s “Competitiveness Compass” and Savings and Investments Union 
of February and March 2025, respectively, are remarkably convergent in terms 
of the structural reforms needed, and these necessary actions do not involve 
any extra fiscal cost. As the Banque de France put it in its recent “Letter to the 
President of the French Republic"  xiv, we need a general mobilisation based 
around three imperatives – 3 ‘i’s, or, if you prefer, size multiplied by muscle and 
by speed.  
First we need to integrate the single market more. This means focusing on our 
size by removing internal barriers, especially in numerous sectors such as 
services and energy.  Second we need to invest better, giving greater priority to 
the most promising disruptive innovations, especially those linked to artificial 
intelligence (AI). To do this, we need to develop Europe’s financial muscle 
through a genuine Savings and Investments Union that channels m ore of our 
abundant private savings into European equity financing and venture capital.  
Finally, we need to innovate faster. Europe needs simplification: less 
bureaucracy, fewer procedures and shorter deadlines. But simplification does 
not mean deregulati on. The European approach will remain firmly focused on 
its objectives, but more agile in its conception.

However, this economic and financial sovereignty  can only be achieved if it 
meets one key condition: that the political aims and expectations of the 
economic players are rapidly aligned . To this end, I call for a mobilising 
deadline, as Jacques Delors did in the past with 1 January 1993 for the single 
market, and 1 January 1999 for the single currency.xv It is up to the Commission 
to propose this deadli ne and the Council to approve it, but why not 1 January 
2028? We need to give ourselves two to three years to emerge more powerful 
and sovereign from the policy turnaround initiated by the current US 
administration. Christine Lagarde has called for a “marc h towards European 
independence” in response to the illusory American “Liberation Day”. xvi The 
Commission should therefore aim to present all of its legislative proposals this 
year. It’s now or never: history will not wait. 
Lastly, I would like to add an essential technological dimension to our monetary 
sovereignty. The digitalisation of the European economy xvii for day -to-day 
payments is increasing our reliance on non -European players, especially 
international networksxviii and big tech. Furthermore, the boom in st ablecoins – 
most often backed by the dollar and strongly promoted by the US government 
– poses a serious risk of “privatisation” and “de -Europeanisation” of the 
currency. For all of these reasons, the Eurosystem is a fervent advocate of a 
digital euro – a banknote in the digital arena. The aim is not to replace banknotes 
and coins or existing banking solutions, but here too, an ostensibly technical 
project masks an essential political dimension. 
* 
Faced with America’s policy shift, and as we commemorate the 80th anniversary 
of the end of the Second World War and the 75th anniversary of the Schuman 
Declaration,xix Robert Schuman's words resonate even more sharply today: “It 
is no longer a question of vain words, but of an act, of a bold act, of a constructive 
act.”xx Yes, we urgently need to shake off a certain economic nonchalance and 
overcome our stupefaction faced with the new US administration. We need a 
general mobilisation: the French and European response must be a collective 
one, with a fair sharing of the burden and a decisive pace of action. This can be

France and Europe’s moment if – and only if – we do this. Thank you for your 
attention.
