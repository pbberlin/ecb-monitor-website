SPEECH
The transmission of monetary policy: financial
conditions and credit dynamics
Welcome address by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board
of the ECB, at the 5th WE_ARE_IN Macroeconomics and Finance
Conference 2025
Frankfurt am Main, 21 October 2025
It is an honour to participate in the fifth edition of the WE_ARE_IN Macroeconomics and Finance
Conference and | congratulate the organising committee for putting together an excellent programme.
Let me start this speech by outlining how the ECB makes monetary policy decisions.“ As expressed in
our monetary policy statement:
The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target in the medium
term. It will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate
monetary policy stance. In particular, the Governing Council’s interest rate decisions will be based on
its assessment of the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it, in light of the incoming economic
and financial data, as well as the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy
transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
My aim today is to review one dimension of this multi-pronged assessment: how we assess the
strength of monetary policy transmission. In what follows, | describe some of the analysis that has
underpinned this assessment in recent monetary policy meetings.
| will begin by outlining the contribution of monetary policy to financial conditions before reviewing
aggregate credit dynamics. Next, | will move to three key factors in determining monetary transmission:
first, heterogeneity across member countries; second, the implications of a high level of uncertainty for
monetary transmission; and third, the transmission impact of external factors, namely trade tensions
and the exchange rate.
Monetary transmission and financial conditions
Between July 2022 and September 2023, the ECB raised interest rates from -50 basis points to 400
basis points.) After a nine-month holding phase, the monetary policy easing cycle started in June
2024. Between then and June 2025, we lowered our policy rates by a cumulative 200 basis points.
Since June, our policy rates have remained unchanged.
In capturing the impact of changes in policy rates on the wider financial environment, it is useful to
assess blended measures such as financial conditions indices (FCls), which synthesise the information
from a variety of financial asset prices. As such, FCls extend the concept of the monetary policy stance


to a wider set of financial markets and beyond the level of accommodation or restrictiveness that is
under the central bank’s direct control. Akin to a stance measure, loose or tight financial conditions tend
to stimulate or dampen economic activity, thus representing an upside or downside force acting on
inflation.
Typically, FCls combine — in a static manner that does not allow for feedback from the economy — a
broad set of financial variables, including risk-free rates, sovereign and corporate spreads, equity
valuations and exchange rates. It is a standard part of our assessment to study a range of FCI
measures, including those developed at the ECB, international policy organisations and private-sector
versions. Today, | will focus on a new addition to the family of FCl measures: a new “Macro-Finance”
FCI that has been developed by ECB staff in order to overcome the “lack of feedback” problem./4!
The new methodology incorporates mutual feedback between macroeconomic and financial dynamics,
such that the Macro-Financial FCI reflects the joint dynamics of macroeconomic variables and financial
conditions. As can be seen from the left panel of Chart 1, the overnight rate (ESTR), which is closely
tied to our policy rates, typically comoves with and sets the direction of the overall index. But there are
also several phases in which financial conditions have moved even when the policy rate was stable
(Chart 1, left panel).
The decomposition (Chart 1, middle panel) illustrates that, at the onset of the global financial crisis in
2008, plummeting risk asset prices (dark green area) turned from being a stimulative influence on the
FCI to acting as a sudden and sharply tightening factor. The widening of sovereign bond spreads
during the European debt crisis (light blue area) also provided extra restriction in the years around
2012. During the episode when policy rates were close to their lower bound, compressed long-term
nominal rates and negative real interest rates were important sources of accommodation. As a result,
the Macro-Finance FCI reached historically supportive levels in late 2021. It then climbed rapidly in the
run-up to the first interest rate hike in July 2022, since the term structure of interest rates sequentially
moved higher well ahead and in anticipation of our rate hikes and quantitative tightening.

Notes: The left panel plots the Macro-Finance FCI alongside the €STR. The middle panel shows the index and its
decomposition, with contributions estimated in a macro-finance model (Bletzinger, T. et al., forthcoming). The
“Short rate” refers to the €STR, the “Long rate” to the ten-year nominal OIS rate, “Real rates” to the one-year real
OIS rate in one year’s time and the five-year real OIS rate, “Sov. spreads” to the two- and ten-year euro area GDP-
weighted sovereign bond spreads over OIS rates, “Risk assets” to investment-grade corporate bond spreads and
the CAPE ratio, and “Euro fx” to the NEER of the euro. The right panel compares the joint fit of euro area HICP
inflation and the composite PMI when substituting the index with other measures in the model. The fit of the Macro-
Finance FCI is normalised to 100, and the fit of the other models is expressed relative to that benchmark. The
Goldman Sachs FCI refers to Stehn et al. (2019) and the weighted average FCI to Arrigoni et al. (2020). The
principal component is the statistical factor that explains most of the variation among the financial market variables
entering the Macro-Finance FCI.
The latest observations are for 17 October 2025.
In recent years, the Macro-Finance FCI peaked around the end of the 2022—23 monetary tightening
cycle. The increase in the index during this period was primarily driven by rising risk-free rates, with
adjustments in risk assets playing a more limited role. Since the peak of the tightening cycle, the index
has indicated that financial conditions have become noticeably less restrictive, supported by lower
short-term interest rates and higher valuations for risk assets, although this has been partly offset by a
stronger euro.
Despite this easing, the level of the Macro-Finance FCI remains well above its historical sample
average. In part, this can be attributed to a permanent component to the 2022 shift in the monetary
policy stance: the re-anchoring of inflation expectations at the two per cent target means that markets
do not expect a return to the “low for long” rate environment that had been expected before the
pandemic to continue on an open-ended basis.
The new index outperforms other measures when it comes to describing the macroeconomic dynamics
of the euro area (Chart 1, right panel). In this regard, it is key to understand that the financial prices and


yields that are aggregated into the Macro-Finance FCI influence bank loan dynamics and loan pricing:
this summary statistic of (mostly market-based) financial conditions can be interpreted as an important
determinant of broader funding conditions, including those set by the banks, which can be collectively
labelled as “financing conditions”. In the next section, we turn to a review of credit dynamics.
Monetary transmission and credit dynamics
Lending rates have been declining broadly in line with historical regularities (Chart 2). But there is a
detectable difference between developments in the lending rates to households and to firms: the
relatively muted decrease in long-term market rates has contained the decline in the cost of household
loans, which tend to be priced off the longer end of the term structure of interest rates and have longer
fixed-rate periods, relative to loans to enterprises. As outlined above, this is consistent with a
permanent component in the 2022 upward shift in policy rates, with no return expected to the “low for
long” zone.

in each of the two panels. Dates are selected as the first change in policy rates in a hiking cycle.
The latest observations are for August 2025.
In terms of credit volumes, household borrowing, primarily for home purchases, has increased steadily.
According to the bank lending survey (BLS), the recovery in mortgage demand is supported by
improved housing market prospects and lower interest rates (Chart 3, panel A). Corporate borrowing is


also gradually recovering, though BLS responses suggest that corporate demand for credit remains
subdued, also reflecting global uncertainty and trade tensions.
This evidence raises the question of how credit is evolving compared to past regularities, given
macroeconomic conditions and considering the current phase of the policy cycle. The strength of credit
dynamics relative to the broader economy can be gauged through a credit-to-GDP gap analysis, which
captures the deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from historical benchmarks. This gap can be
estimated using a range of methodologies, from simple univariate approaches to more sophisticated
models that account for the broader state of the economy. Regardless of the method, the gap remains
in negative territory (Chart 3, panel B). This may reflect both structural factors and cyclical conditions.
However, using multivariate models to control for prevailing cyclical conditions does not change the
inference: credit seems to be weak if assessed against past regularities. 4
A number of structural shifts have been cited to explain a diminished role of credit in advanced
economies. For example, households spend less on durable goods and more on services, for which
they do not typically need to borrow. Demographic trends can reinforce these trends and explain why
mortgages might be in lower demand than in the past. Also, spending on intangible assets — including
intellectual property, software and code — has surpassed tangible investments as a share of GDP in
major economies since the global financial crisis. And intangibles tend to be financed using internal
funds or equity, being harder to pledge as collateral for loans. Even the Al-related investment boom in
physical infrastructure, including data centres, has been primarily financed by equity.
But such structural shifts matter less for the euro area than for other economies, which leaves the
effects of the previous tightening cycle as an important candidate explanation for the persistent
weakness in credit that we observe today, That is, the current credit dynamics most likely reflect the
cross-currents arising from the recent easing overlapping with the delayed effects of the past
tightening, together with the fact that there is a permanent component to the rate tightening compared
to the pre-pandemic levels. For instance, lending rates on new loans are still above those on
outstanding loans, and BLS indicators show that the cumulative tightening has not yet been fully
reversed.

filtering techniques and multivariate models.
The latest observations are the second quarter of 2025 (July 2025 BLS) for the left panel and the first quarter of
2025 for the right panel.
A range of other factors that are not unrelated to the cycle may also help explain why the credit gap
indicators remain negative. Heightened risk perceptions and higher bank funding costs, combined with
declining excess liquidity, have played a role. In addition, pressures from supervisory and regulatory
requirements to maintain solid balance sheets amid rising uncertainties, alongside the goal of
supporting financial stability, have kept credit standards tight through the cycle, even as monetary
policy has been eased in recent quarters. At the same time, financing from non-bank lenders has
remained contained since the start of the monetary policy tightening, despite their secular increasing
role in funding the real economy.


Looking in more detail at the sources of external financing for firms other than borrowing from banks,
corporate bond issuance has benefited from foreign inflows into euro area bond funds in recent
quarters, amid a shift in investor cross-border funds in favour of the euro area. Non-listed equities have
also increased recently, likely reflecting activities of private equity funds. One segment of non-bank
financing that has been growing significantly in recent years is private credit. Private credit generally
refers to non-bank corporate credit provided through bilateral agreements or small “club deals”
involving lenders outside the realm of securities investors or commercial banks. Despite a clear
expansion in the euro area over recent years, the lion’s share of private credit is originated in the
United States. Although numbers vary depending on the exact definition of private credit and source,
the size of private credit in the United States is well above €1 trillion, while for the euro area numbers
range from around €100 billion to around €300 billion.“ Taken together, non-bank financing has not
grown enough to counteract the weakness in bank lending. The dynamics of all the sources of external
finance for euro area firms, including equity financing, but also trade credit and non-bank financing,
remain contained by historical standards (Chart 4), hence overall measures of the credit gap, as shown
in Chart 3, remain negative.
On net, the ongoing transmission of monetary policy easing to credit volumes has been more gradual
than anticipated building on past regularities. Equally unusual has been the pronounced heterogeneity
across sectors and across borrower characteristics, which | will discuss next.

accounts payable other than trade credits.
The latest observations are for the first quarter of 2025.
Heterogeneity of transmission
Heterogeneity in the transmission of monetary policy can affect its overall macroeconomic impact.
Differences in sectoral balance sheets and sectoral exposures to macroeconomic shocks can influence
the responses of households, firms and banks to changes in financing conditions4)
For instance, the growth rate of loans to the manufacturing sector, although recently supported by the
surge in activity due to frontloading of euro area shipments to the United States, has been weaker than
that of loans to the services sector (Chart 5, Panel A),22] As manufacturing is capital-intensive, this
development connects to the anaemic growth in investment in recent years. Moreover, manufacturing is
also working-capital intensive, and therefore especially affected by the cost channel of monetary policy.
That a stronger recovery in the manufacturing sector has so far not materialised helps explain a weaker
pass-through of monetary easing via the cost channel than would normally be expected. The
underlying reasons could be related to the greater exposure of manufacturing to the external
environment, a topic that | will get back to later. By contrast, credit dynamics in the services sector have


been driven largely by real estate and leasing activities, supported by recovering domestic demand for
housing and durable goods in the euro area.

Notes: Left panel: in the left-hand side chart, the super-sectors are identified from the following NACE sectors:
Manufacturing (C), Services (G, H, I, J, L, M, N O, P, Q, R, S, T, U). The industry survey is sourced from ECS and
represents the production trend observed in recent three months, while the services production is sourced from
STS. The series for the loans to firms in the manufacturing sector and for the industry survey have been smoothed
using a three-month moving average. The right-hand side chart represents the growth contribution of selected
sectors for April 2025. Right panel: the left-hand side chart represents the index (January 2024 = 0) of the stock of
loans by size. Company sizes are defined as small for 50 employees or less, medium for 51 to 250 employees,
and large above 250 employees. In the right-hand side chart, loan growth by PD group has been rescaled to match
BSI aggregates and purged from PD migrations. High (resp. low) risk firms are those with a PD above (resp.
below) 1.6%, the third quartile of PD in lending flows.
The latest observations are for May 2025 for AnaCredit, July 2025 for ECS.
At the firm level, credit growth is increasingly concentrated among larger and less risky firms (Chart 5,
panel B). Results from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) confirm that small
firms have experienced a more muted decline in external financing costs than larger producers. This
points to contained transmission via the balance sheet channel and the risk-taking channel of monetary
policy. Smaller firms, being more vulnerable to current macroeconomic risks, have therefore suffered


sharper balance sheet losses. At the same time, banks have been more reluctant to extend credit to
riskier borrowers./2! Since small firms also face greater obstacles in accessing alternative sources of
funding, banks’ reluctance to lend further tightens the financial constraints facing smaller and riskier
firms and weighs on their ability to invest.“4

Notes: Left panel: momentum is defined by the difference between the (3m-o-3m annualised) and the annual

mortgages relative to before the monetary policy tightening, broken down by income quintile. Income quintiles are
computed over the weighted distributions of the variable at the country level and by wave.
The latest observations are for August 2025 for the left panel and July 2025 for the right panel.
Household loan dynamics have also shown dispersion across countries, highlighting the role of both
the collateral and cash-flow channels in monetary transmission during the tightening and easing
phases of the cycle (Chart 6, panel A). Differences in national mortgage markets are a key factor,
reflecting institutional features such as the share of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and their
maturities.“2! Historical regularities show that the pass-through is stronger in mortgage markets with a
higher share of adjustable-rate mortgages and shorter maturities, reflecting both the larger movements


in short-term compared to long-term market rates and the faster repricing of the total stock of
outstanding loans when fixation periods are shorter.14l Indeed, over the past two decades, floating-rate
mortgages — which are more reactive to the policy rates — have become less popular in the major euro
area economies. The shift in the types of mortgages means monetary policy takes longer to work its
way into households’ debt payments. This delay in transmission means that, despite recent rate cuts,
average mortgage rates are expected to rise further and drag on consumption for a number of years to
come as households remortgage on to higher rates after completing long-term fixed deals.U4
Moreover, through the collateral channel, recent interest rate cuts have pushed up asset values more in
countries with high ARM shares, thereby boosting collateral values.
After a period of declining mortgage applications during the tightening period, mortgage applications
have started to increase in recent quarters. Higher income households, however, have maintained
lower mortgage applications compared to the pre-tightening period (Chart 6, panel B). Instead,
mortgage application growth has come mostly from lower-income households, possibly reflecting the
need to maintain consumption or housing purchase plans in spite of declining real wages and with less
savings, especially if they spend a large share of their income on basic goods. Thus, we see a shift in
the composition of mortgage demand.“4]
Summing up, the change in borrower composition and the muted risk appetite of banks point towards
the risk-taking and balance sheet channels of monetary policy operating less strongly for lower-income
households and smaller firms during the easing cycle. Since these groups typically have higher
marginal propensities to consume and invest, this heterogeneity in transmission may reduce the
effectiveness of recent interest rate cuts in stimulating aggregate demand in the current context of high
global uncertainty.
Uncertainty and transmission
An important factor that may distort and at times suppress the transmission of monetary policy is
uncertainty. Over the past year, economic policy uncertainty has risen sharply, reaching record levels in
April, largely driven by trade tensions and geopolitical risks (Chart 7, left panel). Financial market
volatility has, instead, remained subdued (Chart 7, right panel). While uncertainty has eased somewhat
in recent months, it remains at historically high levels on both sides of the Atlantic according to
newspaper-based measures, close to the peak seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Monitoring elevated uncertainty is crucial in analysing credit dynamics for two main reasons.
First, it directly lowers credit demand and credit supply. ECB staff finds that unexpected increases in
economic policy uncertainty have a negative effect on bank lending in the euro area.29] When
economic policy uncertainty spikes unexpectedly, households and businesses tend to delay their
consumption and investment decisions, as the value of waiting for additional information increases./24]
As a result, the financing needs and loan demand of firms drop in synch, as shown in recent BLS
replies. On the lender side, banks may adopt a more cautious stance as well, delaying the approval of


new loans and thereby affecting the availability of credit within the economy.4! These effects are
amplified if financial market volatility spikes up.
Second, ECB staff also finds that elevated uncertainty diminishes the impact of monetary policy easing
on firms’ investment.22] Even when a central bank lowers rates to encourage banks to lend and firms
and households to borrow, spend and invest, the impact may be weaker or slower during periods of
heightened uncertainty.
On its own terms, if uncertainty weakens monetary transmission, this implies that a more powerful
monetary intervention is required to deliver a given policy objective. At the same time, monetary
policymakers must strike a balance between the incentives to act more powerfully and the incentives to
wait and see whether an uncertainty spike self-corrects in a timely manner.4 As noted in our
September monetary policy statement, uncertainty has declined compared to the peaks in the second
quarter but remains elevated compared to historical norms.

External factors and transmission
The strength of monetary policy transmission depends on the configuration of the macroeconomic
shocks hitting the euro area. Two (interconnected) external shocks are currently shaping euro area
macroeconomic dynamics. First, a large portion of the uncertainty highlighted above stems from


outside the EU, reflecting unpredictable shifts in foreign economic policies and concerns about the
future course of geopolitical tensions. Second, there has been a substantial appreciation of the euro.
The recent tariff agreement between the EU and the United States has eased trade policy uncertainty
and overall economic policy uncertainty to some extent, yet important questions remain. A key source
of risk is the ongoing tensions in US-China trade relations. If these tensions persist, Chinese exporters
would have stronger incentives to redirect shipments toward non-US markets, heightening competition
for European firms.22] Such increased competition would weigh on demand in export-intensive and
import-competing European sectors, reducing corporate earnings and weakening the transmission of
monetary easing through the cash flow and balance sheet channels. In addition to these demand-side
effects, trade tensions may disrupt supply chains, amplifying the risk faced by banks in lending to firms
participating in international trade and thus amplifying conditions of uncertainty.29
Trade fragmentation is also heightening concerns about elevated risks to economic conditions.
According to the BLS, perceived risks related to the economic outlook have been contributing to a
tightening of credit standards since the last quarter of 2024 (Chart 8, panel A), despite the fact that
policy rates have been reduced for much of this period.
Based on the sector-country allocation of bank credit to firms that trade with the United States, the
greater risk lies with loans to exporters. This is due to the higher relative size of these exposures, and
to the specifics of the July tariff agreement, which introduced a broad-based US tariff of 15 per cent for
EU goods, although with some exceptions and carveouts (Chart 8, panel p).24 Looking ahead, it is
crucial to keep an eye on the asset quality of lenders that have significant exposure to tariffs. While so
far there are limited signs of deterioration in asset quality, banks’ perception of lending to firms more
affected by tariffs could impair the supply of credit, weakening the monetary policy easing impulse.

Households currently benefit from a strong labour market, a low and stable inflation outlook and
favourable conditions in the housing markets. However, those working in certain sectors, in particular
manufacturing, are increasingly worried about the negative effects of tariffs, expecting income declines
and tighter credit access. As a result, they anticipate submitting fewer credit applications (Chart 9,
panel A). At the same time, lower-income households are starting to report increasing difficulties in


meeting mortgage payments (Chart 9, panel B). Higher financial distress rates of households pose a
downside risk for the transmission of the recent interest rate cuts./28!

Turning to the impact of euro appreciation on monetary transmission, there are two broad channels.
First, euro appreciation affects credit demand and credit supply through its impact on macroeconomic
dynamics. Second, euro appreciation affects the balance sheets and funding conditions of banks.
In relation to the former channel, euro appreciation is typically associated with slower growth and lower
inflation over a multi-year horizon. At the same time, the impact varies across euro area corporates,
such that it is important to take into account the differences across bank-firm pairs. In one direction, the
appreciation of the euro against the US dollar and other currencies lowers price competitiveness for
European exporters and import competers. In the other direction, firms that do not have large USD-


denominated revenues but pay for intermediate input costs (e.g. energy) in foreign currencies
(especially the dollar) benefit from a term-of-trade improvement from euro appreciation.221
For credit supply, the net impact via the real economy depends on their client mix: institutions more
exposed to tradable sectors may face tougher conditions, but banks with a high presence in the
non-tradable economy may benefit from the stronger purchasing power of their customers (Chart 8,
panel B). On the one hand, market analysts are already discounting exposures to the United States in
their estimates of euro area banks’ profitability prospects (Chart 10, panel A), despite the overall
positive expectations for the sector.22] On the other hand, an appreciation of the euro improves the
euro area’s terms of trade by lowering import prices, supporting real incomes and potentially making
borrowers’ balance sheets stronger, eventually increasing banks’ willingness to serve customer
segments benefiting from cheaper imports.
Turning to the latter channel, the depreciation of the dollar has a direct impact on the effective quantity
of USD-denominated liquidity. USD-denominated assets constitute an integral part of the liquidity
management practices of banks, both for those with active business lines in the United States and for
those that use liquid dollar assets as hedging devices.
During the tariff turmoil, the unusual combination of a sell-off in US Treasury securities and a
weakening dollar made it more difficult for euro area banks to rely on their USD-denominated liquid
assets — once considered safe havens offering downside protection — to cushion lending and funding
pressures. 24] Banks with lower USD-denominated liquidity buffers saw their bond spreads widen more
sharply. While the USD LCR is not mechanically affected by movements in the exchange rate and the
liquidity regulation in the EU generally does not require banks to hold LCR levels in foreign currencies
above 100 per cent, excessively low levels of USD LCR may become a source of fragility for banks
during episodes of large exchange rate volatility. 221 Since the euro area banking system has made
progress in increasing their USD LCRs in recent years (Chart 10, panel B), it did not experience
sizeable liquidity strains even at the height of the exchange rate volatility in early April, though the
episode may have altered the algebra of liquidity management for the remainder of the year, 23]
Since euro appreciation reflects a global portfolio rebalancing that has triggered higher capital inflows
into the euro, this may provide a windfall of funding opportunities for euro area banks while also
creating the market conditions that have further contributed to the compression of bank bond spreads.
Against this backdrop, bank bond issuance activity has rebounded since May, including a pickup in
USD-denominated bonds.4! Moreover, globally active euro area banks, for which USD funding
represents a non-negligible share of total liabilities, can pass through the easier funding conditions to
other banks via interbank money market lending.
Euro appreciation also generates valuation losses on the asset side of euro area banks but also
effective funding cost reductions on the liability side. The repercussions of these two countervailing
effects on the intermediation capacity of banks and credit supply depends on the aggregate net
exposure but also on whether exposures via assets and liabilities are unevenly distributed in the cross-
section.


Exposures on the asset side can be sizeable. Total USD exposures represented almost 10 per cent of
the assets of the euro area banking system in the second quarter of 2025, 26! Among the banks with
USD asset exposures, the interquartile range of the ratio of these exposures over total assets lies
between 5 per cent and 25 per cent as at the second quarter of 2025, with around one half of the
overall exposures accounted for by loans of banking groups active outside of the euro area (Chart 11,
Panel A). In general, the valuation impact is relatively contained when cast against the capital buffers of
the euro area banking system or previous episodes of valuation losses associated with, for instance,
fluctuations in the value of sovereign holdings.
Moreover, euro area banks also have a substantial part of liabilities denominated in USD, with an
interquartile range ranging between 7 per cent and 28 per cent as at the second quarter of 2025, and
with a total amount similar to that of assets. A substantial share (43 per cent) of USD-denominated
liabilities is provided by financial entities (Chart 11, panel B) and is therefore relatively volatile,
especially during market turbulence. Overall, the net exposure in USD is rather stable over time: for
banks with USD exposures, it is close to zero for the median bank and slightly negative in the
aggregate at -2 per cent of banks’ assets. Moreover, reflecting the asset-liability management practices
and the business models of banks with significant USD activity, net exposures are typically relatively
unreactive to fluctuations in the exchange rate, policy rates or the business cycle. At the same time, the
combined presence of substantial USD-denominated off-balance sheet exposures and volatile funding
means that sudden changes in these net exposures cannot be ruled out. An increased probability of
such a risk event would then generate pressures on both sides of banks’ balance sheets and potentially
downward pressure on on-balance sheet exposures like loans to the real economy. 24 Moreover, the
composition of USD liabilities, dominated by funding from financial customers and with a limited share
of retail deposits, can exacerbate these pressures by making funding more flight-prone, thereby
increasing vulnerability in a stress scenario.

Conclusions
My aim in this speech has been to showcase some of the analysis that has underpinned our
assessment of the strength of monetary transmission in recent monetary policy meetings. In overall
terms, monetary policy transmission is progressing smoothly. Yet, within this overall favourable
environment, the analysis reported above highlights that it is also important to take into account
significant differences across different types of banks, firms and households, across different sectors
and across countries.
More generally, the analysis shows that the strength of monetary transmission is time-varying and also
depends on the configuration of domestic and external macroeconomic shocks hitting the euro area


economy. Accordingly, it makes sense to maintain a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach
to assessing the strength of monetary transmission at any given point in time. In turn, this feeds into our
overall monetary policy decision making, alongside our other assessment criteria: the inflation outlook
and the risks surrounding it, together with the dynamics of underlying inflation.

See Avalos, F., Doerr, S. and Pinter, G. (2025), "The global drivers of private credit," B/S Quarterly
Review, March for one part of the range. What distinguishes private credit in Europe from the one in the


United States is the reliance on equity financing, rather than debt financing, and the competition with
banks, rather than the reliance on bank financing. See Block, J., Jang, Y.S., Kaplan, S. and Schulze, A.
(2024), “A survey of private debt funds”, Review of Corporate Finance Studies, Vol. 13, No 2, pp. 335-

(2024), "Where Do Banks End and NBFIs Begin?", CEPR Discussion Paper, No 18939 for the analysis
on the linkages between banks and non-banks in the United States. European banking supervision is
monitoring risks coming from banks’ exposure to non-bank financing, see Buch, C. (2025), “Hidden
leverage and blind spots: addressing banks’ exposures to private market funds”, The Supervision Blog,
3 June.

These estimates are based on market data sources, which might underestimate the real size of the
private credit market, while aggregate unconsolidated statistics from national accounts do not
disentangle private credit exactly from all non-bank financing.

The role of financial structure in the transmission of a European monetary policy is, incidentally, a topic
that is as old as the ECB, going back at least to the discussion of “a number of issues for the newly
constituted Board of the ECB” by Dornbusch, R. et al. (1998). See Dornbusch, R., Favero, Carlo A.,

responds to changes in interest rates. Garriga, C., Kydland, F.E., and Sustek, R. (2017), “Mortgages

There may be some idiosyncratic currency-specific minimum quantitative requirements in isolated
cases. Euro area banks are also required to report currency-specific exposures in currencies other than
the reporting currency if they exceed 5 per cent of the institution or the single liquidity subgroup’s total
liabilities, excluding own funds and off-balance-sheet items.

monetary policy, see e.g. Altavilla, C., Boucinha, M., Burlon, L., Giannetti, M. and Schumacher, J.

However, net issuance — adjusting for maturing amounts — remains below levels seen in previous
years, suggesting that banks are not frontloading borrowing despite increased demand for euro-
denominated assets.
