The heat is on: challenges and opportunities  
of the energy transition
Opening remarks by Fabio Panetta 
Governor of Banca d’Italia
G7-IEA conference on ‘Ensuring an orderly energy transition’* 
Banca d’Italia 
Rome, 16 September 2024
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen
It is a pleasure to welcome you to the G7-International Energy Agency (IEA) conference 
on ‘Ensuring an orderly energy transition’. 
Let me start by thanking the IEA, on its 50 th anniversary, for its role in improving the 
security of the international energy system and for providing us with data and analyses 
that are essential to our collective efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our economies.
Today’s conference gathers together a comprehensive group of policymakers, regulators, 
academics and business representatives that will guide us through several critical aspects 
of the transition to a net zero emissions world. 
Before I leave you to the work of the conference, let me share some thoughts on these 
topics.
The energy transition is inevitable and must be managed in an orderly way 
After a series of important steps forward following the 2015 Paris Agreement, we are now 
seeing signs of discontent with the energy transition. 
Net flows into sustainable investment funds are losing momentum, with redemptions 
occurring in some countries due to political backlash against climate initiatives; 1 some 
* I wish to thank Paolo Angelini, Ivan Faiella, Fabrizio Ferriani, Andrea Giovanni Gazzani, Luciano 
Lavecchia for their valuable insights and contributions.

large asset managers are scaling back their involvement in global climate efforts; 2 
renewable energy companies are facing increasing financial headwinds; 3 and export 
restrictions on critical minerals are steadily increasing 4 amid a challenging geopolitical 
situation, marked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the devastating events in the Middle 
East and increasing economic and trade fragmentation.5 
Alongside these worrying developments, there are some encouraging ones. 
Global investment in clean energy is now double that in fossil fuels. 6 The recent COP 28 
meeting highlighted significant improvements, including commitments to phase out fossil 
fuels, expand renewable energy capacity, improve energy efficiency and reduce methane 
emissions.7 In addition, major global emitters such as China are making extraordinary 
progress on renewables, reaching their wind and solar capacity targets well ahead of 
schedule.8  
Despite all the potential challenges, the transition remains inevitable: this conviction 
transcends personal preferences, as there is now a consensus in the scientific community 
that the long-term economic damage from climate change and a disorderly energy 
transition far outweigh the costs of implementing the Paris Agreement (Figure 1).
With global temperatures breaking all records 9 (Figure 2), we must balance the need 
for a gradual energy transition, given that these processes take time, 10 with the risk of 
postponing further emissions reductions, and thus reaching catastrophic climate tipping 
points. 
So what can be done to ensure an orderly energy transition?
Reducing the cost of the transition through international cooperation
There is no doubt that the green transition will be expensive. Green energy investment, 
which is expected to exceed $3 trillion globally in 2024, 11 is still a long way from the

$4.5 trillion required annually by the early 2030s to achieve net zero emissions by mid-
century.12 
More importantly, this financing gap conceals significant differences between advanced 
economies and emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs).13 
Despite accounting for one third of global GDP and two thirds of the world’s population, 
EMDEs (excluding China) only account for 15 per cent of global clean energy investment. 
This underinvestment is partly due to difficulties in raising capital: financing transition-
related projects in EMDEs can be twice as expensive as in advanced economies (Figure 3). 
Although the geopolitical challenges facing the world today make international 
cooperation more difficult than in the past, it is important to reaffirm that cooperation is 
crucial in order to combat climate change.
A fair and effective solution would be to establish an international incentive framework, 
such as the  Global Carbon Reduction Incentive (GCRI) scheme, whereby countries with 
higher per capita emissions compensate countries with relatively low emissions.14 
A GCRI-type scheme would increase the stability and credibility of domestic policies 
in this area, which are essential for private sector investment decisions. It would also 
reduce the overall cost of the transition and provide a solution to the financing problem 
in EMDEs, which could then invest in clean energy projects rather than in much cheaper 
coal-fired plants. Advanced economies should recognize that the resource transfers 
involved in the scheme would be more than offset by the economic damage avoided 
from climate change that they would suffer if the transition effort failed. 
In addition, effective international cooperation is critical to fostering transition-related 
technological innovation. To this end, it is essential to remove barriers to the global 
diffusion of green and low-carbon technologies, a strategy that would be less vulnerable 
to political backlash than regulation and carbon pricing. 
Avoiding new forms of energy dependence
Energy security, which was suddenly brought to the fore by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 
is now a key priority on policymakers’ agendas. The transition to low-carbon energy 
sources is part of the solution: increasing renewable energy production will help countries 
wean themselves off their dependence on fossil fuels.
Unfortunately, there is a significant risk of replacing fossil fuel dependency with a new one.

The production of the critical minerals required for the transition – lithium, copper, nickel 
and cobalt, among others – is highly concentrated, with the top three producing countries 
supplying between 50 and 85 per cent of global production (Figure 4). 15 China is the 
world leader in rare earths mining, controlling about 70 per cent of world production, 
and has an even larger share of refining. 16 China also leads the world in the production 
and deployment of wind, solar photovoltaics (PV), batteries and electric vehicles (EV), and 
is at the forefront of advances in these areas.17
Europe is dependent on imported critical minerals, due to its limited natural resources 
and to delays in transition-related industrial sectors. 
Cooperation at European level is essential to address this issue through the integration 
of gas and electricity networks, which are key to the continent’s energy security; such a 
policy will also increase the efficiency of the investments needed for the transition and 
avoid a patchwork of national efforts. 
Another key part of the solution is to diversify international partnerships and build 
mutually beneficial relationships with countries rich in critical inputs. Strengthening 
critical mineral supply chains is at the heart of initiatives such as the Resilient and Inclusive 
Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE) project,18 which aims to help low- and middle-income 
countries become more integrated into supply chains for products that are key to the 
energy transition.
Finally, all technological options should be considered in order to promote the 
diversification of decarbonized energy production.19 
Managing the twin transition: green and digital
The world we live in is facing an energy transition, but also a digital transition. They are 
interlinked and both require significant investment.20
15 IEA, Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2024, 2024.
16 IRENA, 2023, op. cit.; this percentage is even higher when the geographical concentration is adjusted 
to account for the capital ownership of mining companies: Faubert V., Guessé N. and Le Roux J.,

Institute for Energy Studies, OIES Paper, CE14, 2024.
18 The initiative launched by the World Bank and the Japanese Presidency of the G7 is also at the heart of 
the G7 agenda under the Italian Presidency; see World Bank, ‘World Bank and Japan to Boost Mineral 
Investments and Jobs in Clean Energy’, press release, 11 October 2023.
19 For example, the development of small modular reactors for baseload power production; see Panetta F.,  
2024, op. cit.
20 The public and private climate-related investment needs in the EU are around €620 billion per year on 
average. To this is added approximately €125 billion annually for the digital transition; see Panetta F., 
2024, op. cit.

The expansion of power-hungry digital technologies such as data centres and artificial 
intelligence (AI), not to mention crypto-assets, is driving up energy demand. These 
technologies now account for 2 per cent of global electricity consumption, but this 
figure is expected to more than double by 2026, increasing to 1,000 TWh, an amount 
comparable with Japan’s total power demand. 
This additional electricity demand will not only slow down the phase-out of fossil fuels,21 
but it will also increase pressure on water resources due to the additional electricity 
generation and cooling needs of IT equipment.22 
Yet technology can also be an important ally in the energy transition. Promising 
applications show the potential for technology and AI to help power grids accommodate 
an increasing share of intermittent renewable sources, improve forecasting and climate 
risk assessment, and reduce the cost of sustainability reporting.23 
As both the energy and the digital transitions are inevitable transformations, it is up to us 
to make the most of them, ensuring that we maximize their combined potential and reap 
the full benefits, not just the costs.
Building public support for climate action
Transitioning to a long-term carbon-neutral energy system will benefit us in many ways, 
decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels, mitigating climate risks and reducing local 
pollution. 
However, the costs of this process will be difficult to bear, particularly for energy-intensive 
businesses and vulnerable households. 
In fact, most climate change mitigation policies, such as carbon pricing, put pressure on 
the energy bills of businesses and households. 
The consumption baskets of less affluent households are heavily weighted towards 
energy goods. They will therefore be disproportionately affected by the gradual increase 
in energy costs required for the transition. Similarly, firms in the hard-to-abate sectors 
will need to change their technologies and business models and may face existential 
threats. 
21 While the additional power demand can be met with low-carbon solutions, the materials required to 
build new data centres (steel, cement, chips) can push emissions up. See Crownhart C., ‘AI is an energy 
hog. This is what it means for climate change’, The Spark. MIT Technology Review, 2024.
22 According to some recent estimates, a small number (between 10 and 50) of simple queries using 
the nowadays obsolete GPT-3 consumes half a litre of water.  Summing up and considering future 
projections, total global AI water demand in 2027 is estimated to be between 4.2 – 6.6 billion cubic 
metres of water withdrawal, equivalent to more than half the total annual water withdrawal of the 
United Kingdom. See Li P., Yang J., Islam M.A. and Ren S., ‘Making AI Less ‘Thirsty’: Uncovering and 
Addressing the Secret Water Footprint of AI Models’, ArXiv, abs/2304.03271.

on ‘The macroeconomic and financial dimensions of the green transition’, Fiesole, 28 June 2024.

These issues need to be addressed through appropriate policies. While well-intentioned, 
policies to achieve ambitious climate goals, that promote extreme or overly rigid 
approaches, risk backfiring by alienating the public and thus reducing political support 
for climate initiatives.24
A successful transition requires a comprehensive, credible, and inclusive strategy that 
simultaneously addresses the environmental and social aspects of the problem, and 
strikes the right balance between ambition and feasibility. 
Compensatory mechanisms, such as the redistribution of revenues from carbon pricing 
schemes, are essential to mitigate the impact of the transition on less affluent households 
and on the competitiveness of the productive system, ensuring that no one is left behind.25 
Communicating the benefits with a clear, transparent, and evidence-based approach is 
also essential to enhance its legitimacy and acceptability among citizens.  
Conclusions
The path to achieving an orderly energy transition faces formidable technological and 
societal challenges, which are currently compounded by geopolitical tensions. In the face 
of such tensions, we should focus on collective efforts to counter climate change.
Governments of the major world economies should lead the way. They should 
promote low-carbon investment, reduce the administrative and regulatory burden 
that hinder the transition, and avoid damaging stop-and-go policies that create 
uncertainty and undermine crucial private sector investment. This is the essence of 
the orderly transition process we need to establish.
As central bankers, our policy decisions can be improved by a better understanding of 
the macroeconomic implications of the transition. With this perspective in mind, this 
conference is part of a two-day event designed to foster a cross-fertilization between 
policymakers and technical experts. Tomorrow, the event will continue with a meeting 
of the G7 modelling expert networks to discuss the macroeconomic impacts of climate 
change and the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Thank you for your participation. I wish you all two days of constructive talks.

physical risks occur. This baseline scenario represents a world in which climate change does not occur. Climate change therefore has a negative impact on GDP 
in every plausible scenario, but the magnitude of the losses differs across them.
