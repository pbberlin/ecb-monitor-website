The Global Economy: 
Navigating Uncertainty and Change

DA FARE

1. The international economy
In the advanced economies, inflation is declining and nearing central 
banks’ targets, leading them to gradually ease monetary tightening. The exception 
is Japan, where rising inflation has led the central bank to raise official interest 
rates to 0.5 per cent, the highest level in 17 years. 
Compared with the past, disinflation has been faster and less harmful to 
economic activity. This is thanks to the rapid unwinding of the shocks that 
had pushed up consumer prices – such as high energy costs – and to monetary 
policy, which has kept inflation expectations anchored. 
In the United States, where inflation is falling unevenly amid robust 
growth, the Federal Reserve is easing monetary conditions more gradually 
than expected. Its decisions are also being influenced by the recent change in 
administration, whose new fiscal and trade policies could significantly impact 
the economy and inflation, with implications for monetary policy. In the midst 
of this, longer-term yields have risen since the beginning of December, despite 
the drop in short-term interest rates, spurring an appreciation of the dollar 
(Figure A.1). 
In the emerging economies, the inflation scenario varies from country to 
country. 
In China, consumer price inflation is practically nil, while producer price 
inflation has been negative for two years, exposing the economy to the risk of 
deflation. Repeated monetary and fiscal interventions have supported financial 
markets, but their effectiveness in restoring price stability is uncertain. 
By contrast, inflation remains high in Brazil, Türkiye and Argentina, 
forcing central banks to maintain tight monetary conditions. 
As regards economic activity, the global economy continues to expand at 
a moderate pace, with differences across regions and sectors.
In addition to the ongoing stagnation in the manufacturing sector, which 
has lasted for over a year, there is now also a slowdown in the service sector.

In the United States, growth remains strong, driven by rising household 
consumption, in turn fuelled by growing employment and wages, as well as 
stock market gains. 
In other advanced economies, instead, growth remains weak.
In China, domestic demand is being held back by declining consumer 
confidence and by the ongoing real estate crisis. Exports are accelerating, though 
this may partly reflect a temporary effect of a frontloading of foreign sales to avoid 
any future US tariffs.1 
Looking ahead, the International Monetary Fund expects global growth to 
remain steady at just over 3 per cent in 2025 and 2026. The medium-term forecast 
of 3.1 per cent remains contained from a historical standpoint.2 
The risks to growth remain tilted to the downside, mainly owing to 
geopolitical tensions and persistent challenges in the Chinese economy. 
Moreover, high global indebtedness could have a negative impact on economic 
activity if it were to cause volatility or financial instability. Finally, the US 
administration’s policies could negatively affect global economic growth and 
financial conditions. 
2. World trade
Global trade is undergoing significant changes, driven by economic, 
geopolitical and technological factors.3 
Many countries are focusing their trade relations on trusted partners with 
whom they have long-standing relationships or common political and economic 
affinities. This trend is reshaping the geography of commerce,  reducing trade 
between countries from opposing geopolitical blocs and increasing it between 
politically aligned economies (Figure 1).4

This pattern affects both advanced and developing countries, and has led to a 
sharp decline in the share of Chinese products in imports of technology goods to 
the US and, more recently, to the European Union. 
In many cases, the geographical diversification of supply sources is 
merely apparent. Exporters have restructured their supply chains, creating 
triangulations through third countries to bypass trade barriers. For example, 
some Chinese products are exported to the United States through Mexico, 
Vietnam or Taiwan (Figure A.2). 5 Additionally, Chinese firms are setting up 
production facilities in countries not subject to restrictions, or directly in those 
that have imposed them. 6

Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and Taiwan; the bloc of countries ‘aligned with China’ includes, 
alongside China, countries such as Iran and Russia; the remaining group of ‘neutral countries’ includes, among others, 
Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Türkiye and Vietnam. Geopolitical alignments 
among countries are based on the indicator proposed by T. den Besten, P . Di Casola and M.M. Habib, ‘Geopolitical 
fragmentation risks and international currencies’ , in ECB, The international role of the euro, 2023, pp. 41-47 , supplemented

Fragmentation reduces the efficiency of global trade, increasing the cost of 
goods and making supply chains more complex and vulnerable. In many countries, 
this could limit the availability of certain products, especially technological goods 
and those crucial for the climate transition.7 
Trade tensions and their impact
The reconfiguration of trade I have just described, in which geopolitical 
factors play a key role, is undermining the multilateral system of global economic 
governance built on productive integration and free trade. International trade 
is increasingly wielded as strategic leverage, particularly in technological 
competition.8 
In this context, the new US administration is rolling out a strategy that 
includes imposing new and higher import tariffs. 9 Partners with substantial 
trade surpluses with the United States are particularly targeted. China’s surplus 
with the US economy amounted to about $300 billion in 2024, accounting for 
around one third of China’s total trade surplus and one quarter of the US deficit 
(Figure 2).
According to our estimates, if the tariffs announced before the US election 
were to be implemented and followed by retaliatory measures, global GDP growth 
would fall by 1.5 percentage points. The impact on the US economy would be 
more than 2 percentage points. For the euro-area, the impact would be more limited 
– around half a percentage point – but Germany and Italy would be more affected 
due to their strong trade ties with the United States. 10 Initially, these negative

Working Papers, 1224, 2024; A. Mattoo, M. Ruta and R.W. Staiger, ‘Geopolitics and the world trading 
system’, NBER Working Paper, 33293, 2024.
9 According to pre-election announcements, tariffs are expected to rise from the current 2 per cent to 
between 10 and 20 per cent. Those on Chinese products could reach 60 per cent, up from the current 
15 per cent. After taking office, the new US administration implemented a 25 per cent additional tariff 
on Canada and Mexico and a 10 per cent additional tariff on China. The tariff on Canada and Mexico 
was then put on hold, but that on Chinese imports remains in force. China responded with new tariffs 
on US imports and restrictions on its exports of raw materials. 
10 These estimates are based on the assumption that US tariffs will rise to 60 per cent for China and to 20 
per cent for other countries. If tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China stayed at the levels initially 
set, their impact would be much smaller, shaving about half a percentage point off global growth, 
should trading partners hit back. The contraction in the United States would be 1-2 percentage points, 
while the impact on the euro area would be practically nil.

effects could be exacerbated by the rising uncertainty over trade policies that has 
already emerged in recent weeks (Figure 3).
The most striking example of this is China. Given its excess production 
capacity in the industrial sector, Chinese firms have been lowering export prices 
for some years (Figure 4), boosting foreign sales and gaining higher market shares 
in emerging economies (Figure A.3).11
The imposition of high tariffs by the US could lead Chinese exporters to seek 
new markets to offset the drop in sales to the US market. In this scenario, Italian 
and European businesses would face growing competitive pressure from Chinese 
firms, whose sectoral specialization is increasingly similar to that of European 
industry.12 
11 The reduction in Chinese export prices has been uneven across markets: the World Trade Monitor of 
the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis estimates that the global average unit value 
of goods exported by China fell by 18 per cent between January 2023 and October 2024. According to 
Eurostat, the prices of Chinese goods for euro-area markets fell by 11 per cent over the same period. 
12 The estimates used in this speech also account for the indirect effects of other countries redirecting 
goods affected by US tariffs. However, these are difficult to quantify and could turn out to be greater 
than expected.

History shows that trade wars harm growth, including for the countries that 
start them.13 Tariffs do not guarantee a reduction in the current account deficit. 
If they did, they would also lead to a lower net inflow of capital into the country 
imposing them,14 prompting adjustments through higher savings by residents or 
lower investment. 
The US administration may therefore be using tariff announcements as a 
bargaining chip to redefine economic and political relations around the world. 
13 The trade war triggered by the protectionist measures of the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930 
aggravated the Great Depression; see R.S. Grossman and C.M. Meissner, ‘International aspects 
of the Great Depression and the crisis of 2007: similarities, differences, and lessons’, Oxford 
Review of Economic Policy , 26, 3, 2010, pp. 318-338; F. Perri and V. Quadrini, ‘The Great 
Depression in Italy: trade restrictions and real wage rigidities’, Review of Economic Dynamics , 
5, 1, 2002, pp. 128-151.
14 In the balance of payments, an economy’s current account deficit coincides with its net external 
borrowing, net of statistical discrepancies. The current account balance can be interpreted as 
reflecting the saving and investment decisions of a country’s resident sectors. Any improvement 
– a reduction in the deficit – must be offset by an increase in savings or a decrease in investment; 
see M. Obstfeld and K. Rogoff, ‘The six major puzzles in international macroeconomics: is there 
a common cause?’, in B.S. Bernanke and K. Rogoff (eds.), NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2000 , 
Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press, 2001, pp. 339-412.

However, in a world already fraught with geopolitical, trade, and military 
tensions, this strategy could spin out of control, producing unintended consequences, 
exacerbating existing disputes and creating new divisions.15 
Negotiated solutions based on cooperation are not only a preferable 
alternative; they are essential to prevent a spiral of conflicts that could jeopardize 
global stability.
3. The European economy 
The euro-area economy is struggling to regain momentum.
Following the stagnation that set in at the end of 2022, GDP grew at a 
moderate pace in the first quarters of 2024, and then came to a halt again at the 
end of the year.
Domestic demand lacks strength. The saving rate has reached high levels, 
boosted by the increase in real yields and by the desire of households to rebuild  
the wealth that was eroded by the inflation shock. 16 Moreover, the succession of 
crises – from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine – has probably made consumers 
more cautious.
Expectations of a recovery driven by consumption and supported by 
employment have been repeatedly disappointed. The Eurosystem’s growth 
forecasts have been revised downwards since the end of 2023 (Figure 5.a), as have 
the expectations of private operators (in contrast with those for the US economy; 
Figure 5.b). 
Based on recent data, the recovery could be further delayed. 
Consumer confidence has fallen again (Figure A.4) amid growing pessimism 
about the economic outlook and a weakening labour market, to which I will return 
shortly. In the face of such uncertainty, consumers are unlikely to reduce their 
savings.
15 In some worst-case fragmentation scenarios, the impact of tariffs could slash global GDP by as much 
as 6 per cent; see M.G. Attinasi et al., ‘Navigating a fragmenting global trading system: insights for 
central banks’, European Central Bank, Occasional Paper Series, 365, 2024.

ECB, Economic Bulletin, 8/2024, pp. 59-63.

10
Investments17 are also slowing down, due to worsening growth prospects and 
the still restrictive tone of financial conditions.
With no solid recovery in domestic demand, the euro-area economy has 
found some support in foreign demand. The contribution of net exports (about half 
a percentage point in 2024)18 can largely be put down to the stagnation of imports, 
against barely positive export growth (Figure A.5).
The manufacturing sector is suffering the most, as it continues to lose market 
share to Chinese manufacturers. This trend, which has been ongoing for years, is 
particularly pronounced in the automotive sector, one of the pillars of European 
17 Capital investment is calculated as the difference between gross fixed capital formation and investment 
in housing; it is net of the temporary fluctuations induced by the movements across countries of 
intellectual property products of multinational enterprises based in Ireland.

projections, December 2024.

industry. Looking ahead, the difficulties faced by the automotive industry could 
have serious consequences for other sectors too.19
These developments highlight the risks of over-reliance on external demand. 
At a time of tense trade relations, Europe’s broad openness to international trade20 
and close integration into global supply chains (Figure 6) make its economy highly 
exposed to fluctuations in the global market and vulnerable to renewed protectionist 
pressures.
Europe must adopt a new growth model that strengthens the single market 
and reduces reliance on external factors. Investment needs to be revitalized, as 
19 The automotive industry accounts for 9 per cent of value added in euro-area manufacturing and 16 per 
cent for Germany. Across the estimated overall supply chain, for each automotive industry employee 
there are 1.8 employees in Italy and Spain and 1.6 in France and Germany; see A. Orame, G. Cariola 
and G. Viggiano, ‘Il settore automobilistico italiano nella transizione verde: evidenze empiriche e 
valutazioni degli addetti ai lavori’, Banca d’Italia, Questioni di Economia e Finanza (Occasional 
papers), forthcoming. 
20 In 2023, the share of euro-area exports in global markets (outside the euro area) was 15.0 per cent for 
goods – more than 6 percentage points higher than the United States.

it has been lower than in the United States for years; its shortfall is particularly 
evident when compared with Europe’s high savings capacity.21
Increasing investment alone is not enough, however. It is essential to 
invest better, prioritizing projects and reforms that can raise productivity, 
whose sluggish growth is the main weakness of the European economy 
(Figure 7.a).
Innovative sectors are at the top of the list, as they are the drivers of 
productivity (Figure 7.b); this is especially true of those connected with the twin 
environmental and digital transition, which also plays a crucial role for European 
strategic autonomy (as in the case of energy).
The resources needed are sizeable, and require both public and private sector 
contributions. Interventions should be carried out through joint actions at European 
level in order to foster economies of scale and prevent the duplications that would 
result from fragmented national initiatives.

Europe needs what I recently referred to as a ‘European productivity compact’. 
This does not mean creating a fiscal union, introducing an EU finance minister 
or establishing mechanisms for systematic transfers between countries. Rather, 
it involves setting up a common spending programme – targeted in its objectives 
and limited in time and cost – to finance investments that are indispensable for all 
European citizens.22 
Alongside strengthening the growth potential of Member States, this would 
generate a stable supply of common European safe assets, an essential building 
block for creating a single capital market capable of financing innovative projects, 
including riskier ones. 
The priorities and strategies to make the European economy more competitive 
are clear and have been carefully reviewed.23 The real challenge now is to put them 
into practice.
4. Inflation and monetary policy 
Inflation in the euro area is almost back to its 2 per cent medium-term 
target. 
The increase in recent months, up to 2.5 per cent in January (Figure A.6.a), 
was anticipated and is partly due to base effects relating to past energy price 
developments.24 
Core inflation25 has remained at 2.7 per cent but indicators of momentum, 
which better capture recent trends, have shown an almost continuous downward 
trajectory since the beginning of last year, standing at 2 per cent in January 
(Figure A.6.b).
Services prices have continued to grow at a relatively strong pace of 3.9 
per cent. This pattern partly reflects the slow and gradual adjustment of many

more than a market: speed, security, solidarity. Empowering the Single Market to deliver a sustainable 
future and prosperity for all EU Citizens’, April 2024.

period to the next.
25 Core inflation excludes food and energy products, which are highly volatile.

services prices to past inflation and is therefore set to ease as a result of the decline 
in headline inflation.26 
Overall, there are reasons to assume that inflation will settle at 2 per cent over 
the medium term, in line with the latest Eurosystem staff projections.
The improvement in inflation has allowed the ECB Governing Council to end 
the policy rate hiking cycle that began more than two years ago and to reverse the 
path since last June. Since then, the ECB has cut its key interest rates five times, 
bringing the deposit facility rate to 2.75 per cent.
However, monetary policy has not yet fully normalized. 
The reference rate is still higher than the estimated neutral rate, namely 
the level consistent with the absence of inflationary pressures and with 
potential economic growth. 27 As a result, monetary policy continues to exert a 
downward pressure on economic activity and on inflation, an effect that is less 
and less necessary with near-target inflation and persistently weak domestic 
demand.
As a matter of fact, the neutral rate concept will become less important going 
forward. Its estimates are highly imprecise. They only provide a rough indication 
of the monetary policy stance, becoming increasingly less useful as policy rates 
approach the estimated neutral level. More importantly, the concept of a neutral rate 
of interest is not enough to accurately calibrate the pace of monetary normalization. 
Monetary policy decisions must always be based on an overall assessment 
of the outlook for the real economy and inflation, in which projection exercises 
play a key role. This is especially true for the euro area today, thanks to the 
recent improvement in the quality of inflation forecasts. 28 
According to the projections published by the Eurosystem in December, 
inflation would hit the target if the key interest rates were lowered to around 
2 per cent in mid-2025, in line with the market expectations prevailing at the

fast-movers and late-comers in euro area inflation’, SUERF Policy Brief, 1070, January 2025.
27 These estimates generally stand at around 2 per cent in nominal terms; see C. Brand, N. Lisack and 
F. Mazelis, ‘Natural rate estimates for the euro area: insights, uncertainties and shortcomings’, ECB,

time. Under this scenario, a less decisive easing of monetary policy could lead 
to excessively low inflation in the medium term.
The risks to inflation 
The economic outlook is evolving rapidly, as are the risks surrounding the 
forecasts, which need to be carefully assessed.
At present, the main downside risk to inflation is weak economic activity, 
a concern I have already addressed.
This is compounded by risks stemming from rising long-term yields, mainly 
as a result of the increase in long-term US dollar interest rates that spilled over to 
European financial markets, causing the euro area to ‘import’ from the United States 
a monetary tightening that would not be justified by its own economic outlook. 
Moreover, the increase in yen interest rates is prompting Japanese investors to scale 
back their exposure to foreign securities, including European bonds, in favour of 
domestic securities.29 This shift is exerting upward pressure on long-term euro rates. 
Fears that wage growth may be inconsistent with price stability are subsiding, 
as indicated by the latest available data on labour costs (Figure 8.a), recent 
collective bargaining agreement renewals,30 and signs of weakening labour demand 
(Figures 8.b and 8.c). 
Presumably, an increase in US tariffs on exports from Europe would not significantly 
impact inflation. The tariffs could produce upward pressures linked to a depreciation 
of the euro against the US dollar and to possible retaliatory measures from the EU. 
However, these effects could be offset by a slowdown in the global economy and by 
China diverting its tariffed goods to European markets. According to our estimates, the 
net effect of the tariffs on inflation would be limited, if not slightly negative.
The greatest risks to inflation arise from the energy markets, which are experiencing 
high volatility and rising prices, especially for natural gas. In the near term, this could 
also increase inflation volatility. Future developments will need to be monitored closely, 
although a slowdown in global demand may help to contain price pressures in the 
medium term.31 
29 M. Novik, I. Smith and D. Keohane, ‘Japanese investors dump Eurozone bonds at fastest pace in a 
decade’, Financial Times, 26 January 2025.
30 The recent negotiations in the German manufacturing industry resulted in moderate increases in the 
metalworking sector and a wage cut for the Volkswagen automotive group.
31 According to many analysts, China’s demand for oil has peaked and is likely to fall in the coming years, 
owing to the rapid expansion of renewable energy capacity. 

16
Overall, the available indicators seem to suggest that the predominant risk remains 
inflation falling below 2 per cent over the medium term. This conclusion is consistent 
with both inflation expectations derived from financial contracts and with analysts’ 
assessments.

Monetary policy normalization must continue, with decisions supported by 
communication focused on the medium-term outlook for the real economy and 
inflation. At this juncture, overemphasizing specific data releases could heighten 
uncertainty and market volatility, ultimately making monetary policy less effective.
5. The Italian economy
Economic growth in Italy has waned in the last few quarters (Figure A.7), 
owing in part to the challenging international environment and the effects of 
monetary tightening. 
This weakening has taken a toll on investment and exports, the two components 
that largely drove the strong post-pandemic recovery. 
Investment in capital goods has been hit particularly hard by the difficulties 
facing the manufacturing sector, which are common to the entire euro area.32 
Sales abroad are suffering because of the weakness of Europe’s economy, and 
of Germany’s in particular, which absorbs 12 per cent of Italian exports. Nearly 
half of the manufacturing firms that sell to Germany have seen their exports to 
this market decrease (Figure  9), which has had a negative fallout on industrial 
production, in decline since 2022. The German economy’s difficulties are spilling 
over to Italy via trade.33 
The main driver of growth has been household consumption, supported by the 
strong labour market and by the gradual, albeit still partial, recovery in real wages 
(Figure A.8). 
For 2024 as a whole, GDP grew by 0.5 per cent – and by about another 0.2 
percentage points without adjusting for calendar effects – but growth stalled in the 
second half of the year. According to our forecasts, GDP is expected to resume 
its expansion in the coming months. Lower interest rates, high employment levels 
and a recovery in foreign demand should support consumption and exports, while 
encouraging firms to invest.34 
32  The construction sector also contributed negatively, largely driven by the reduction in the very generous 
incentives for building renovations, which proved unsustainable for the public finances.
33 Despite recent problems, exports are about 10 per cent higher than in 2019, while the current account 
balance is again largely positive. Over time, geographical and sectoral diversification and cost 
competitiveness gains have enabled Italian firms to absorb the shocks that have hit some sectors, such 
as energy-intensive ones, and specific markets, such as the United Kingdom and Russia.
34 Despite the uncertainties surrounding international trade policies, Banca d’Italia’s most recent business 
surveys found that most firms still expect to increase investment in the first half of 2025.

18
As in the rest of Europe, Italy’s economic recovery is threatened by a 
weakened and uncertain world economy. It is thus even more essential that we 
tackle the problems holding back the Italian economy head-on: weak productivity, 
high public debt, and inefficiencies in public administration.35 
A redoubling of efforts is needed to complete the investments under the 
National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) and related reforms, acting swiftly 
to address any delays. Continuity for the NRRP must be provided, maintaining the 
reform momentum and rebalancing the public finances to support investment in 
human and physical capital and in innovation.
In addition to supporting economic activity in the coming months, the 
implementation of the NRRP will improve productivity and growth potential, 
contributing to a full recovery in real income and boosting domestic demand. It 
would therefore strengthen confidence in measures taken at European level, paving 
the way for joint investments to increase productivity.
Of equal importance is the implementation of the medium-term fiscal structural 
plan drawn up by the Government and approved in January by the Council of the 
35 F. Panetta, ‘The Governor’s Concluding Remarks’, 31 May 2024 and F. Panetta, ‘If we are not after the 
essence, then what are we after?’, speech at the 45th Foundation Meeting for Friendship among Peoples, 
Rimini, 21 August 2024.

EU. The prudent management of the public accounts is already bearing fruit, 
narrowing the yield spread between Italian and German government bonds. 
Staying the course could lead to improved sovereign debt ratings, which 
remain at the low levels of 15 years ago, when Italian bonds were downgraded 
following the financial and euro-area debt crises. 
Since then, the Italian economy has made considerable progress in terms 
of financial stability: its net international investment position has risen above 
12 per cent of GDP, an improvement of over 35 percentage points compared 
with 2013 (Figure A.9); the banking sector has significantly improved its 
profitability and its capital position; the government securities market has 
become more liquid and efficient, attracting a broad and diversified investor 
base. 
These factors, alongside a rebalancing of the public finances, could 
contribute to further reductions in government bond yields, improving funding 
conditions for households and firms and making Italy more competitive. 
6. Banks and credit 
Credit growth remains negative in Italy, although there are some signs of 
recovery (Figure A.10). 
Several indicators suggest that this trend, though influenced by cautious 
lending policies, mainly reflects weak loan demand. 
Firms’ financing needs remain low owing to sound profitability and sluggish 
investment. Moreover, the share of firms reporting difficulties in accessing credit 
is falling across all sectors and size classes (Figure A.11). 
For their part, banks have a strong capital base that can absorb any increases 
in the demand for funding. 
However, the contraction of credit warrants attention. Small firms continue to 
record a greater and persistent reduction in loans (Figure 10); moreover, for these 
firms there are some signs of a potential shortage of credit. As economic activity 
recovers, these firms may need more external funding; it will then be essential for 
banks to ensure that viable firms have access to credit. 

20
Credit quality 
The flow of non-performing loans remains moderate; its increase in the 
corporate sector is attributable to the effects of the interest rate hikes over the past 
years, in line with the forecasts made at this meeting one year ago.36 
Government guarantees on loans, which were strengthened to address the 
pandemic emergency, helped to contain insolvencies. The stock of guaranteed 
loans is now declining, though very gradually (Figure A.12.a), as redemptions are 
largely offset by sizeable new loans (Figure A.12.b). 
In a situation that is back to normal, government intervention should be scaled 
down and the terms and conditions for providing guarantees should be reviewed. 
The Budget Law for 2025 has already taken steps in this direction.37 
36 F. Panetta, ‘Economic developments and monetary policy in the euro area’, speech at the 30th ASSIOM 
FOREX Congress, Genoa, 10 February 2024.
37 More specifically, the ceiling for guarantees that can be issued by the Fund for improving access to 
credit for SMEs has been lowered to €160 billion (from €225 billion in 2023 and €200 billion in 2024). 
The stock of guarantees issued by the Fund over the five years 2015-19 amounted to €60 billion. 
Moreover, while the current regime has been extended to 2025 and is still more favourable than the 
pre-pandemic one, some corrective measures have been introduced to discourage excessive recourse to 
government guarantees. See F. Panetta, ‘1924-2024: one hundred years of fostering a savings culture’, 
speech at World Savings Day, Rome, 31 October 2024.

Further measures should be put in place to preserve this instrument for future 
emergencies and limit risks to the State budget. Resources must be channelled to 
support firms – often small ones – that face difficulties in accessing credit even 
though they have a positive business outlook. 
In any event, banks must comply with supervisory standards when granting 
and managing loans, including guaranteed ones. Any negligence could undermine 
the effectiveness of government guarantees or provide public support to unworthy 
projects, exposing financial intermediaries to credit, legal and reputational risks. 
Deposits 
Internet and mobile banking now allow depositors to transfer their savings 
quickly, even outside working hours and without going to a branch. This benefits 
customers, but also increases liquidity risk for banks, which may face large and 
sudden outflows of funds in times of stress.38 
In the current environment, where the ECB is withdrawing excess liquidity, 
banks need to weigh carefully the benefit of the low funding costs of sight deposits 
against the risk of sudden outflows. 
Greater recourse to term funding helps stabilize funding sources, making 
liquidity management safer and more predictable. In recent years, there has 
been a shift from sight deposits to time deposits, driven by the larger yield 
increases offered by the latter. However, the gap with other European banks 
remains wide. 
Moving further along this path would strengthen the stability of the Italian 
banking system, especially in a global arena that exposes financial intermediaries 
and markets to sudden shocks.
However, stepping up term funding requires caution when it comes to 
complex financial instruments. In recent years, there has been strong growth in 
‘certificates’,39 partly due to tax advantages.40 
38 Under normal circumstances, sight deposits are a relatively stable form of funding. However, in 
moments of high stress, they can become a source of vulnerability.
39 Last June, certificates issued by banks amounted to €84 billion, of which €56 billion were held by 
households. 
40 Certificates income is taxed as capital gains (sundry income) rather than as dividend or interest 
(investment income). It can therefore be offset against losses on other securities, unlike investment 
income. Investors who have made losses on other investments therefore have an incentive to turn to 
certificates, as they can avoid paying taxes on the corresponding income by offsetting it against capital 
losses.

22
These products, which are linked to one or more underlying assets, 41 can 
improve the risk-return profile of diversified portfolios, but are only suitable 
for investors with adequate financial skills. Banks must ensure they are placed 
responsibly and not offered to customers who are unable to assess their costs and 
risks. 
Together with Consob, we are closely monitoring developments in this market 
and have repeatedly highlighted the high risks.42
Mergers and acquisitions
The Italian financial system is seeing a wave of mergers and acquisitions 
involving banks of different sizes, insurance companies, asset managers and 
foreign intermediaries.
These transactions are primarily driven by the abundance of excess capital 
in the banking sector. Moreover, the prospect of shrinking lending margins 
due to declining interest rates is driving banks to seek economies of scale or 
synergies.
The announced transactions would narrow the size gap between the largest 
Italian banks and European competitors. On average, the total assets of the top 
five Italian banks are four times lower than those of their French counterparts and 
one and a half times lower than those of Spanish and German banks (Figure 11). 
While scale in banking generally brings both advantages and some well-known 
challenges,43 these transactions can be seen within the broader perspective of the 
European market’s integration and consolidation.
41 The underlying assets are interest rates, stock market indices or commodities. 
42 Banca d’Italia, ‘The Bank of Italy’s intervention power concerning financial instruments: regular 
assessment of risks to financial stability’, press releases, 26 April 2022, 21 April 2023 and 24 April 2024; 
and Banca d’Italia, Financial Stability Report, 2, 2024.
43 Setting aside the potentially negative repercussions for competition, large banks can become systemically 
important to the point of posing a risk to the economy in the event of failure. As a result, they could 
benefit from an implicit guarantee of government intervention should they find themselves in distress 
(the ‘too-big-to-fail’ issue). Bank resolution aims to remedy this issue, but it is not easily implemented. 
Large banks also bear the brunt of a high level of complexity and the costs that come with it, which 
could limit their efficiency and further complicate resolution; see D. Amel, C. Barnes, F. Panetta and 
C. Salleo, ‘Consolidation and efficiency in the financial sector: a review of the international evidence’, 
Journal of Banking and Finance, 28, 2004, pp. 2493-2519. 

22 23
Banca d’Italia is involved in the M&A approval process both independently 
and in cooperation with various national and European authorities. 44 The process 
starts after the transaction has been notified by the relevant entities, which are not 
required to give prior notice to the authorities. 
The supervisory authority verifies compliance with Italian and European 
regulations, assessing whether each transaction will result in a viable, efficient 
intermediary capable of operating in accordance with the principles of sound and 
prudent management, serving the real economy without compromising financial 
stability. 
Subject to these criteria, the outcome of M&A transactions is ultimately 
determined by market dynamics and shareholder decisions.
7. Digital finance 
Technology is changing the relationship between banks and savers, which is 
founded on trust. 
44 In addition to Banca d’Italia, mergers and acquisitions can involve: the Single Supervisory Mechanism 
(SSM), where Banca d’Italia sits on the Supervisory Board, if the transaction concerns significant institutions 
or if it requires authorization to purchase qualifying holdings; IVASS, if it concerns insurance companies, 
including indirectly; Consob, when the transaction is carried out through a public takeover bid or exchange 
offer; foreign supervisory authorities, if non-Italian intermediaries are involved; and the Italian Competition 
Authority. Moreover, if the transaction involves Italian companies with strategically important assets and 
accounts, the Government can exercise special powers to protect national interest (capital screening).

While this relationship was once based on banks’ ability to make payments and 
manage savings prudently, it now extends to ensuring accessibility and continuity 
of service. The protection of confidentiality, which has always been important for 
banking, now plays a crucial role. 
Digitalization enables financial intermediaries to improve efficiency and risk 
management, while providing customers with timelier and cheaper services.
However, the growing interconnections between supervised and 
non-supervised entities and the complexity of processes are increasing the risks to 
business continuity and customer protection. 
Operational and cyber risks
Globally, there has been continuous growth in operational incidents and cyber 
attacks in the banking sector, a trend that is also under way in Italy (Figure 12).

Cyber incidents Operational incidents
Source: Based on supervisory reports.
(1) Banking groups, stand-alone banks, payment institutions and e-money institutions are subject to reporting. Cyber 
incidents include cyber attacks and incidents that have the effect, even unintended, of sharing and/or altering the confidential 
data of a bank and/or its clients. Operational incidents arise due to inadequate or malfunctioning processes, human or 
system error, or force majeure. These events also include natural events, software and hardware errors, accidents, process 
malfunctions, sabotage (physical attacks). − (2) The number of reports indicates the incidents reported by individual banks; 
each incident may give rise to more than one report.

24 25
There are many causes. On the one hand, cyber threats have become more 
sophisticated, as a result of heightened geopolitical tensions and advances 
in artificial intelligence. On the other hand, the complexity of information 
systems, the increase in outsourcing and the involvement of a growing number 
of players in business models have multiplied vulnerabilities. 
IT risks are exacerbated by the concentration of certain services in the 
hands of a few global players. An incident affecting one of these entities 
could have significant international repercussions, 45 leading to both direct and 
indirect losses. The former have been relatively small so far. The latter are more 
difficult to quantify but potentially significant in terms of long-term growth 
and sustainability. 46 The greater speed of financial transactions increases these 
risks.47 
These developments make it more difficult to intervene in the event 
of incidents, cyber attacks or fraud. It is therefore essential that operators 
strengthen their information systems and prevention measures. At the same 
time, consumers must make prudent and informed choices.
To respond to technological risks, the EU introduced the European Digital 
Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which strengthens oversight on providers 
of technology services, on business risk management, and on the testing of 
resilience against attacks. 
Banca d’Italia has stepped up its action on this front. Last December, we 
asked banks to assess their IT risk management systems, especially in terms of 
their effectiveness in preventing breaches of data confidentiality, whether caused 
45 Recent examples include last summer’s CrowdStrike outage that had global (though relatively limited) 
repercussions, as well as the incident involving Worldline, the French digital payments company, when 
gas roadworks accidentally damaged its network connection to data centres in Italy, causing slowdowns 
and disruptions in retail payments.
46 According to the IMF, malicious activity has inflicted direct losses of $12 billion on the financial 
sector since 2004, more than one fifth of which were recorded in the four years 2020-23 (IMF, 
Global Financial Stability Report , April 2024). This figure is likely underestimated because the 
victims of cyber attacks could downplay the real extent of the damages incurred to protect their 
reputation. 
47 For example, settlement times for securities transactions have gone from two days to one in major 
economies such as China, India, and more recently, the United States, Canada and Mexico. Elsewhere, 
faster settlement times are either being studied, such as in the EU, or in the process of being 
implemented (UK and Switzerland). Another example of the greater speed of financial transactions is 
instant payments, which permit real-time settlement of retail payments.

26
by external attacks or unauthorized internal access. We also drew attention to the 
implementation aspects of the DORA regulation.48
At international level, 49 we are working to make the payment and market 
infrastructures more reliable, including by harmonizing incident reporting schemes 
and third-party risk management. During the Italian G7 Presidency, we promoted 
an in-depth analysis of the risks that come with new technologies such as artificial 
intelligence and quantum computing. 
Crypto-assets and digital instruments
The spread of crypto-assets requires the attention of the authorities, also 
because of their extensive use for illicit purposes. 
So far, irregularities and failures involving crypto-asset operators and markets 
have had a limited impact on the financial system, as the two sectors are separate. 
However, the situation is evolving in different ways across countries, raising 
complex questions. 
In Europe, the revision of the Capital Requirements Regulation introduced 
a transitional regime for banks’ crypto-asset holdings, which reflects the spirit 
of the standard defined by the Basel Committee. 50 In addition, with the Markets 
in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), European lawmakers discouraged the 
development of speculative crypto-assets, prioritizing investor protection.51
48 For example, where to place the ICT risk control function in the organization chart; procedures 
for reporting ICT-related incidents and significant threats; and cybersecurity testing within the 
TIBER-EU framework (see Banca d’Italia, ‘Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council of 14 December 2022 on digital operational resilience for the financial sector 
(DORA)’, Communication of 30 December 2024). Together with the Ministry of Economy and 
Finance, the National Cybersecurity Agency and the other relevant national agencies (Consob, 
Covip and IVASS), Banca d’Italia is working to ensure the coordinated implementation of DORA 
and other EU legislation. 
49 Principally, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Organization of Securities 
Commissions (IOSCO), the Eurosystem, the G7 and G20.  
50 The Basel Committee approved a standard relating to the prudential treatment of crypto-assets held 
by banks. It provides for capital requirements similar to those for the underlying assets for tokens that 
are digital representations of traditional assets and for those whose value is permanently pegged to an 
underlying asset. The requirements are far more stringent for other crypto-assets. 
51 Banca d’Italia has indicated that among the instruments envisaged by MiCAR, only electronic money 
tokens (EMTs), whose value is linked to a single fiat currency, can fully perform the means of payment 
function; see F. Panetta, ‘Banks and the economy: credit, regulation and growth’, speech at the Annual 
Meeting of the Italian Banking Association (ABI), Rome, 9 July 2024; see Banca d’Italia, ‘Regulation 
(EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCAR)’, Communication of 22 July 2024. 

26 27
Together with Consob, we have begun to talk to operators interested in 
providing crypto-asset services. 52 Banca d’Italia’s task is to ensure that these 
entities have adequate safeguards in place to manage strategic, operational and 
financial risks, as well as risks linked to money laundering and the circumvention 
of international sanctions.53 
In the United States, in the absence of specific legislation,54 market supervisors 
have intervened in recent years to limit the riskiest developments, while leaving the 
door open for the possibility of integrating crypto-assets into the financial system.55 
However, the new administration is instead inclined to support their expansion.56
These regulatory divergences between the United States and Europe will need 
to be carefully assessed, once the US authorities’ position becomes clearer, in order 
to understand their international implications. Regulatory arbitrage in this field 
may be particularly insidious and difficult to counter: some operators might exploit 
regulatory differences to adopt less-than-transparent or highly risky practices, with 
possible consequences for savers and the integrity of the financial system.
Yet, crypto-asset risks do not only stem from regulatory divergences. It cannot 
be ruled out that one or more crypto-assets, including electronic money tokens, 
could be issued by tech giants and spread across Europe.57 
If these private means of payment, which can easily be integrated into 
commercial platforms with billions of users, were to gain widespread adoption, 
the consequences could be significant.58 
52 Crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) are a new category of operators introduced by MiCaR, offering 
crypto custody, trading and exchange services.  
53 On these issues, CASPs can refer to recent Banca d’Italia consultations (see Banca d’Italia, Consultation 
on the extension of the measures on customer due diligence and organizational, procedural and internal 
control measures to counter money laundering and terrorist financing for crypto-asset service providers, 
15 January 2025).
54 The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, introduced in 2023, was approved 
last year by the House of Representatives but was never written into law. To date, the crypto-asset 
market has been regulated based on the extent to which individual government agencies were willing to 
liken crypto-assets to traditional financial assets and therefore to bring them within the reach of existing 
legislation.
55 In the United States, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot 
Bitcoin ETFs on 10 January 2024.
56 ‘Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology’, Executive Order issued on 
23 January 2025. 
57 Similar instruments are already available in the US, although they have not been widely adopted so far. 
For example, in 2023, PayPal launched PayPal USD, a crypto-asset pegged to the US dollar that can be 
used for transferring money via the PayPal app. 
58 F. Panetta, ‘The cost of not issuing a digital euro’, speech at the CEPR-ECB Conference on ‘The 
macroeconomic implications of central bank digital currencies’, Frankfurt, 23 November 2023. 

28
Commercial banks would risk losing an important part of their operations. In 
the public debate, it is sometimes argued that the introduction of a digital euro would 
entail this risk, overlooking the fact that the real threat comes from crypto-assets, 
for which – unlike the digital euro – there are no holding limits for savers.59 
Moreover, central banks, which are responsible for the smooth functioning 
of the payment system, would be operating in an environment where a handful 
of private, possibly foreign entities would play such an important role that any 
incident could jeopardize the stability of the system. 
The risks to payment systems and financial markets could, therefore, be 
considerable. 
Conclusions
The exit from high inflation is unfolding at a relatively low economic cost. 
The global economy continues to expand, albeit at a moderate pace by historical 
standards. Financial markets and intermediaries also seem to have absorbed the 
severe shocks of recent years.
Yet the risks for the world economy have not gone away. 
The greatest concerns still stem from geopolitical tensions, not only because 
they are fragmenting supply chains and undermining the efficiency of the global 
economic system, but also because they jeopardize the multilateral order and 
international integration in ways that are hard to predict. 
The uncertainty stemming from US trade policies is affecting international 
trade, investment and growth. It needs to be tackled by asserting Europe’s positions 
via dialogue and negotiation, preventing any confrontations that could deepen 
existing fractures and trigger new disputes.
Europe finds itself in the midst of these upheavals, and it is lagging behind in 
forging a strong common response. 
The sluggishness of its economy is in contrast to the vibrancy of the US 
economy. This divergence is not merely cyclical: it reflects a deeper and structural 
challenge in Europe, with the digital lag perhaps its most obvious symptom. The 
59 To ensure that the introduction of a digital euro does not lead to excessive outflows from bank deposits, 
the ECB has proposed a cap on the amount of digital euros that individuals can hold; see F. Panetta, 
‘A digital euro: widely available and easy to use’, Introductory statement before the Committee on 
Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Brussels, 21 April 2023.

28 29
persistent weakness of investment, despite the high saving rates, is a clear sign of 
this malaise. 
But this does not imply an inescapable destiny. To overcome it, we must 
recognize that only a common European response will allow us to successfully 
face up to the current difficulties. 
The Competitiveness Compass – the European Commission’s roadmap 
for this legislative term – correctly identifies three key objectives: innovation, 
decarbonization and strategic autonomy. 
Achieving these goals will require considerable resources, exceeding those 
available in the EU budget. These can be mobilized through a European productivity 
compact, financed in part by the regular issuance of EU bonds. 
Italy has shown that it can react to crises, and it cannot settle for modest 
growth. The National Recovery and Resilience Plan is a powerful lever for 
investment and reform. It must be implemented with determination and efficiency. 
Fiscal consolidation, productivity and innovation are the priorities for ensuring 
stability and sustainable development.
Europe and Italy can boast a world-class production system, despite the current 
challenges. They can draw on a vast and widespread human capital, extraordinary 
talent, and abundant financial resources that are ready to support new investments 
and fuel growth. They can shape their future with bold choices, vision and unity 
of purpose. 
The task ahead, though by no means an easy one, is to act with clarity and 
ambition, paving the way for a stronger, more competitive and more inclusive 
economy.
