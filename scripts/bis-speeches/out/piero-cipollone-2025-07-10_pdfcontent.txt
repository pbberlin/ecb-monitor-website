SPEECH
Shifting payment landscape: what a digital euro
will bring
Speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the
ECB, at Banka Slovenije
Ljubljana, 10 July 2025
It is a pleasure to speak to you today.
The ongoing shift in the way we pay is affecting the fundamental fabric of our economies. Whether we are
consumers browsing digital marketplaces, entrepreneurs pursuing digital innovation, or decision-makers
facing the digital transition, we are all involved in reshaping payments.
Payments are more than a means of settling transactions, they are the lifeblood of a modern economy.
And in a digital world, our economies will only be as competitive, inclusive, autonomous and resilient as
our payments are.
Slovenia has put the digital transformation at the heart of its economic strategy, aiming to place the
country among the top five most digitalised economies in Europe by 2030.[ ] An innovative and striving
digital payments ecosystem can play a key role in this journey.
As a central bank, our responsibility is to accompany and enable this transition. We must ensure that the
shift to digital payments enhances accessibility and efficiency, without creating fragmentation or new
dependencies.[ ]
Let me be clear upfront: this does not mean abandoning cash. Cash serves us well, providing a European
means of payment that is accessible, accepted throughout the euro area and continuously available.
People remain attached to cash for good reasons, and we are committed to continuing to provide it.[ ] In
fact, we will soon start preparations for a third series of euro banknotes which will bear a new design.[ ]
But cash cannot be used for online payments, which represent a growing share of our day-to-day
transactions. So we need to extend its benefits to the digital sphere. By introducing a digital euro we would
aim to offer a digital equivalent of cash, which preserves Europeans’ freedom to pay with sovereign
money, is free for basic use, preserves privacy, fosters resilience and is accepted throughout the euro
area, for any digital payment.[ ]
In preparing for a digital euro, we are carrying out one of our core tasks as defined in the Treaty: providing
a means of payment with legal tender status and issuing money as a public good.[ ] Given this
fundamental role, if we were the only player in payments that did not go digital, it would be fair to question

whether we would be fulfilling our mandate. By preparing for a digital euro, we are simply adapting to
evolving technologies and preferences.[ ]
This is particularly important in a monetary union like the euro area[ ], where 25 years after the launch of
the euro, we still lack a European solution that enables people to pay digitally throughout the euro area
and for all types of payments. And it is especially relevant today, at a time when dependencies on non-
European solutions could be weaponised.[ ]
A digital euro would be a public-private cooperation, with European payment service providers playing a
key role in its distribution. This would allow them to retain fees and data and would also enable banks to
maintain client relationships. By contrast, these relationships could be threatened by payment solutions
that seek to bypass banks, such as stablecoins which are currently dominated by non-bank and non-
European issuers and mostly denominated in dollars.
Moreover, a digital euro would enable payment service providers to scale up and offer their solutions
throughout the euro area by leveraging the digital euro’s infrastructure and acceptance network. This
would remedy the current state of digital payments, which is a case in point of the situation described by
Mario Draghi, namely that the fragmentation of the European market along national lines prevents
European firms from being competitive on a European level, let alone globally.[ ]
In my remarks today, I will first explore the challenges presented by the current digital transition in
payments. I will then explain how the digital euro offers opportunities to address them.
The shifting landscape for payments
Slovenia offers an appealing snapshot of the transformation which is under way in many European
economies. Slovenians are still deeply attached to cash: in 2024 nearly two-thirds (64%) of payments at
physical locations in Slovenia were made in cash. Yet digitalisation has been advancing steadily, with the
share of card payments at physical locations rising to 29% in 2024, up from 19% in 2016.[ ]
This development is not unique to Slovenia. Across the euro area, increasing digitalisation means that
online shopping now accounts for over a third of day-to-day retail transactions, while cash payments have
fallen to just 24% in value terms.
This shift underscores the importance for us as central banks to not only safeguard trust in money in
physical form, but increasingly in digital form too. Our robust defence of cash stems directly from our
mandate to issue money that Europeans can use and access throughout the euro area for their day-to-day
transactions.
In fact, our work on the digital euro follows logically from our defence of cash. In a world where cash
cannot be used for e-commerce transactions and where people also increasingly prefer to pay digitally at
physical locations, we must provide a digital equivalent of cash. This will preserve the freedom of
Europeans to pay, knowing that a digital euro will be accepted wherever they can opt to pay digitally. And it
7

will allow merchants to reconcile their customers’ preference to pay digitally with the benefits of cash as a
means of payment that protects them from excessive fees and network disruptions.
If we failed to act, we would not only be failing to fulfil our mandate, we would also risk the digital
transformation reversing the progress we have made with euro cash. At present we have no sovereign
and inclusive digital means of payment with legal tender status. As a result, the growing use of digital
payments risks entrenching our dependency on a small number of private non-European players,
subjecting our money to the kindness of strangers. This dependency already results in higher fees for
merchants and the transfer of taxpayers’ money – in the form of lost seigniorage – outside of Europe.
So today I would like to emphasise three major challenges posed by the ongoing transformation.
The first is that the increased use of digital payments results in a growing reliance on non-European
payment providers, which is cause for concern. Two-thirds of card-based transactions in the euro area are
processed by international schemes. Some 13 euro area countries are entirely dependent on non-
European systems for payments.
Slovenia is a case in point. Despite efforts to promote local schemes, the Slovenian payments ecosystem
remains reliant on international card schemes, which dominate the market.
This dependency on non-European payment solutions means that decisions taken outside Europe could
affect European consumers’ ability to seamlessly conduct everyday digital transactions, hindering
Europe’s strategic autonomy.
The second challenge is the persistent fragmentation of the European payments market.
Despite the clear benefits of integration, banks have not managed to unite the market. The lack of
compelling commercial incentives, especially given the profitability and deep-rooted nature of national
payment schemes, has discouraged investment in a pan-European solution. Additionally, coordination
among banks, each with distinct interests, priorities and legacy investments, has proven difficult. 
And even when the infrastructure and a European scheme are in place, like the TARGET instant payment
settlement (TIPS) infrastructure and the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme, we have not seen the
emergence of pan-European instant account-to-account payment solutions at the point of sale. European
providers do not have the incentive or the capacity to invest in competitive, user-friendly front-end
solutions across the euro area.
For example, Slovenia’s instant payment scheme, Flik, offers a promising user experience across various
payment situations. However, its reach remains limited because it is only available to customers of
Slovenian banks, excluding non-residents and domestic users of foreign banks. Moreover, merchant
acceptance of Flik does not yet match that of traditional card payments, partly because its customer base
is still limited. This reflects a vicious circle where limited acceptance discourages adoption and low
adoption disincentivises acceptance by merchants. As well as reducing competition, this makes it
impossible to scale up the solutions offered by payment service providers that are unable to massively
invest in a European-wide acceptance network.

Instead, as the use of digital payments increases, we are left with a patchwork of domestic solutions that
lack the reach and scale to compete effectively across the EU – and sometimes not even at the national
level. In Slovenia, Karanta, a national scheme backed by the largest domestic bank, had a market share of
just 0.20% in 2024.
This fragmentation is not just inefficient; it makes digital payments more expensive and less convenient
than they could be, placing an unnecessary burden on both consumers and merchants. It is estimated that
merchants across the euro area pay around €3 billion every year to process international debit cards.
The third challenge relates to the user experience offered by existing solutions. In Slovenia, for example,
consumers are forced to use multiple apps, cards and platforms to make payments, resulting in a
fragmented and often frustrating experience.
These issues are not specific to Slovenia. They reflect a wider European challenge: the lack of a
European-wide acceptance network for an open digital payment infrastructure that matches the reality of
our increasingly digital and interconnected economies.
A digital euro for everyday payments
In light of these challenges, we need to ensure that the benefits of digital payments are enjoyed by all,
while at the same time safeguarding our sovereignty and the trust that underpins our single currency.
A digital euro would ensure that central bank money remains universally accessible for everyday
transactions, not just in physical form, but also digitally. It would guarantee that citizens can pay anywhere
in the euro area using a trusted, risk-free instrument issued by the Eurosystem. This is consistent with the
Eurosystem’s mandate under the EU Treaties to issue the only means of payment that has legal tender
status. A digital euro would be a modern expression of monetary sovereignty.
And let me say it again: the digital euro is not intended to replace cash. It would complement it. We
recognise that people across the euro area, and especially in Slovenia, are strongly attached to cash. It
remains a vital tool for inclusion, personal freedom and resilience. We are unwavering in our commitment
to cash.
At the same time, our responsibility as a central bank is to ensure that, as payments become increasingly
digital, citizens can continue to benefit from the trust and security that public money provides. In the long
run, maintaining a direct link to a central bank-issued means of payment that is usable at the point of sale
across all use cases may be essential in preserving trust in commercial bank money.[ ] Moreover, without
a public digital alternative, consumers and merchants would be increasingly dependent on the terms,
prices, and data practices set by a few, mostly non-European, private actors. For instance, over the past
few years the average net merchant service charges in the EU have nearly doubled, despite regulatory
efforts to contain them.
Introducing a digital euro would provide an attractive alternative to foreign payment solutions and is the
only way to ensure Europe’s monetary sovereignty. It would guarantee that the euro can always be used
12

for digital payments anywhere in the euro area, ensuring that Europeans retain the freedom to make
transactions seamlessly and securely, independent of decisions taken outside the EU.
Moreover, the digital euro would address the persistent fragmentation that is hampering the retail
payments market. The lack of incentives and coordination among European banks to develop a continent-
wide solution for payments at the point of sale is understandable but hard to overcome, given the
significant investments that are needed to challenge entrenched foreign providers, their acceptance
network and their proprietary standards. Instead, national payment solutions remain dependent on non-
European firms to offer a comparable in-shop payment experience, as is the case for cross-border or tap-
to-pay payments, for example.
So, just as the introduction of euro banknotes united Europe 23 years ago and brought tangible benefits to
its citizens, the digital euro has the potential to create a truly integrated digital payments landscape that
preserves the two-tier payment system and the healthy equilibrium between public and private money that
has served us so well for so long.[ ] As central bank money, it would have legal tender status, meaning it
would be accepted everywhere, instantly generating powerful network effects. Leveraging its open
standards and acceptance network would give European payment providers the scale and certainty they
need to innovate and expand.
This would also benefit banks who are currently losing fees and data to the dominant international
payment solutions and could soon also lose deposits to stablecoins, which are dominated by non-
European firms and are denominated in US dollars for 99% of their value.
For European payment service providers, establishing common standards through the digital euro would
enable platforms such as Flik to extend their reach domestically and to operate across all euro area
countries from the outset, just as easily as national schemes do within national borders. This would open
up the market to fairer competition, forcing established players to adjust the costs they impose on
merchants, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. Consumers would ultimately benefit through
lower prices.
We are designing the digital euro platform in such a way that it expands the range of possible conditional
payments – think of automatic reimbursements in the event of train or flight delays, for example. This will
increase choice and stimulate innovation, leading to a richer and more user-friendly experience for
everyone. The digital euro would rely on a new settlement ledger, intended to support advanced payment
functionalities, including conditional payments. Our prototyping and experimentation have shown that such
payments can be implemented by leveraging application programming interfaces – or APIs as they’re
known. In recent months we have partnered with some 70 merchants, fintech companies, start-ups, banks
and other payment service providers, including from Slovenia, to explore the potential of the digital euro to
drive innovation. We will share our findings soon.[ ]
The digital euro would offer a comprehensive and smooth user experience for consumers that covers all
use cases: payments in shops, online and between individuals. It would provide integrated online and
offline functionalities all while upholding the highest privacy standards. The offline functionality would offer
13
14

cash-like privacy, with transaction details known only to the payer and the payee.[ ] Such an all-in-one
solution does not currently exist, and its introduction would mark a significant step forward for Europe.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Building an agile and robust digital payments ecosystem is essential for Europe’s digital transformation.
Ignoring this task risks further fragmentation and dependencies, resulting in a less convenient and more
costly payment experience for consumers and merchants, including in Slovenia.
The digital euro offers a solution: a European public good that will complement cash, ensuring trust,
sovereignty, and universal access to secure, cost-free payments across the euro area. It will empower
people and businesses in Slovenia and beyond to transact easily and safely, online and offline, at home
and across borders. And it will allow European private payment solutions to scale up and become more
competitive.
Ultimately, the digital euro is more than a currency innovation – it is a public commitment to the future of
Europe’s digital economy. It embodies our shared values of openness, resilience and fairness, ensuring
that as our economies evolve, no one is left behind and that Europe remains in control of its monetary
destiny.
