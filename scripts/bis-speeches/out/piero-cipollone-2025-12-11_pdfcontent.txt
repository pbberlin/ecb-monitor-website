SPEECH
The transformation of money: technological
disruption and the future of financial services
Guest lecture by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of
the ECB, at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management
Frankfurt am Main, 8 December 2025
Money is at the heart of what central banks do.[ ] Ever since central banks have existed, their fundamental
role has been to issue money and protect its value. This role has been the same for centuries, and I don’t
expect it to change. But what is changing is the environment in which central banks must deliver on this
mandate. There are obviously many sides to this, but today I will focus on technology.
Digital payments are the new normal. And new technologies have emerged that are disrupting financial
services, leading us to rethink their future. We are facing no less than a paradigm shift. Financial
institutions have become technological entities. At the same time, tech firms have entered the realms of
payments and finance. In fact, financial institutions and tech firms have all become fintechs. What was
once a niche has become the norm. Harnessing technology to provide better financial services is now the
name of the game.
Central banks are no exception. If they are to retain their role in issuing money that is fit for purpose, they
have to embrace technology and shape the transformation of money. Adapting to new technologies is not
an option, it is an existential must. If central banks don’t issue digital money, they will lose their central role
in money issuance and fail to provide an anchor of stability to the entire financial system. Central banks
are increasingly becoming tech organisations; they must evolve with technology, or risk falling behind.
Today, I will argue that in the European context, the central bank needs to not just follow but take a leading
role in this transformation. If it doesn’t, Europe risks failing to leverage its collective strength. This is
because financial integration is key to achieving the network effects and economies of scale required to
enable our economy and financial sector to reap the benefits of these new technologies while mitigating
their risks. This is particularly vital for the European Central Bank, which operates in a monetary union,
where the singleness of money across the union is necessary for the smooth functioning of payments and
the effective transmission of monetary policy. Looking ahead, we also need to ensure the singleness of
digital money. Doing so will provide a Europe-wide ecosystem in which the private sector can compete by
offering, and scaling up, innovative new services.
We can build on strong foundations. Over the past 25 years, the euro has become the currency of 20
member countries, with Bulgaria set to become the 21st euro area member next month. The euro has
established itself firmly as the world's second most important currency. The Eurosystem – that is, the ECB
1

and the national central banks of euro area countries – implements a single monetary policy that
safeguards the value of the euro and sustains the trust Europeans place in their money.
We have built robust market infrastructures that underpin the euro. T2 (for large-value payments), T2S (for
securities) and TIPS (for instant payments) make it possible to settle in central bank money, a risk-free
asset. Together with ECMS (for collateral management), these public payment rails allow money,
securities and collateral to move freely, safely and efficiently across the euro area. Seen from where we
were 25 years ago, the degree of integration achieved in just over two decades is remarkable.
However, we still face three key challenges.
First, fragmentation persists for retail payments. While the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) has
provided a pan-European solution for credit transfers and direct debits, we have not achieved the same
result at the point of interaction.[ ] Despite infrastructures like TIPS enabling instant payments across the
euro area and the encouragement of the Eurosystem, we still lack a European solution that can be used to
pay digitally throughout the euro area for all use cases. This has resulted in an excessive dependency on
non-European providers for critical retail payment services like cards and digital wallets. This raises
fundamental questions about our strategic autonomy, as this dependency could potentially be used
against us as an instrument of economic coercion.
Second, the very nature of money and payments is changing in ways that could undermine the balance
that has underpinned monetary stability in Europe. The emergence of new technologies, such as
tokenisation and distributed ledger technology (DLT)[ ], has the potential to enhance efficiency in capital
markets. But in the absence of tokenised central bank money, the new ecosystem would not have a
common risk-free settlement asset at its core. The lack of the latter could undo the progress achieved in
wholesale payments between financial institutions by reintroducing fragmentation and credit risk, while
creating new dependencies. Moreover, the expansion of alternative settlement assets denominated in
foreign currencies would go against the objectives of the savings and investments union and undermine
monetary sovereignty. This would also challenge the balance between public and private money that has
served us well so far, with public money providing an anchor of stability into which all private assets can be
converted.
Third, cross-border payments have been a lingering challenge. Because they remain slow and expensive,
the race is on to make them more efficient. While this is a possible use case for stablecoins, the latter
create a number of risks for domestic currencies and financial systems. They could also threaten the
international role of the euro if no strong European alternative emerges to challenge the currently
dominant dollar-denominated stablecoins.
In this context, inaction is not the best choice for Europe. Doing nothing could lead to central bank money
becoming increasingly marginalised, which could end up challenging the resilience of our payments
system and undermining the stability of our financial system, our monetary sovereignty, our strategic
autonomy and our economic security. Over time, this could also weaken the competitive position of
European financial institutions and infrastructures, which, given their importance for the financing of the
2
3

economy, could in turn weigh on European productivity. And it could diminish the role of the euro on the
global stage.
Our mandate does not allow us to take these risks lightly. When the foundations of money and payments
are shifting along with technology, the central bank cannot stand still. We must modernise our payments
offering so that it evolves alongside technological progress and supports the development of an integrated
European market for digital payments and digital assets. Our goal is not to replace private innovation but
to provide a solid public foundation that will enable the private sector to innovate at scale while avoiding
excessive dependencies.
This requires a reinvigorated public-private partnership across three payment dimensions: retail,
wholesale and cross-border. In my remarks today, I will outline our overall approach and then explain our
strategy for retail payments (with the issuance of a digital equivalent of cash, the digital euro), wholesale
payments (by making it possible to settle DLT-based transactions in central bank money) and cross-border
payments (with the interlinking of fast payment systems).
A public-private partnership anchored in central bank money
The complementarity of public and private money
The Eurosystem’s starting point is its core responsibility as an issuer of money and guardian of the smooth
functioning of payment systems. In practice, this means offering means of payment for retail and
wholesale transactions, while ensuring that payment systems remain safe and resilient.
This has several implications.
First, central bank money is a key pillar of our financial system, and we have a duty to keep it fit for
purpose as technologies and preferences evolve.[ ] It cannot be merely a niche solution for specific use
cases or a dispensable add-on; it must respond to the evolving needs of people, businesses and market
participants.
Second, we want to see a strong European payments ecosystem, where the private sector can provide
robust, efficient and innovative solutions that can be scaled up.
These two objectives are not contradictory. In fact, they have strong synergies.
Central bank money solutions are based on pan-European infrastructures and standards that the private
sector can leverage. This not only reduces the risk of fragmentation and ensures interoperability, but also
avoids the need for the private sector to duplicate investments, and reduces costs for the system as a
whole. This is particularly important in a sector characterised by network effects, where technological
dominance and proprietary standards can otherwise restrict the ability of others to compete, innovate and
scale up, as is currently the case in digital retail payments.
Another complementarity stems from the characteristic of central bank money as a settlement asset free
of credit and liquidity risk, issued by an institution that can deliver finality and stability, even under stress.
Some fear that this may create the perception that private money is unsafe. I think the opposite is true. It is
4

the very existence of central bank money as a safe asset and the convertibility of private money at par at
all times that gives people confidence when using private money. That is what makes a euro a euro across
instruments, institutions and technologies. On the rare occasions when this relationship was broken – in
the Free Banking Era in the United States[ ], for example – financial instability ensued. Experimenting
without central bank money for retail or wholesale payments would be unwise.
In fact, in the wholesale space, this is a key reason why the private sector has explicitly told us that the
absence of central bank money as a settlement asset is a major impediment to the growth of the digital
assets ecosystem. Today, wholesale settlement in the euro area is already digital and in central bank
money. But innovation is moving into new environments: tokenised securities, DLT-based trading and
settlement, and smart contract automation. If we want these innovations to be scaled up safely in Europe,
central bank money has clear advantages in terms of safety, scalability and liquidity management
compared with private settlement assets constrained by reserves backing and market risk.[ ]
In other words, central bank money guarantees the availability of a European settlement solution covering
the euro area as a whole, ensuring the singleness of money and strengthening resilience. At the same
time, it provides common rails that create a level playing field and a safe basis for the private sector to
compete and innovate on functionality, user experience, value-added services and business models.
A collaborative approach
To leverage public-private synergies, our approach is explicitly collaborative. We actively engage with all
stakeholders, for instance in the context of the Euro Retail Payments Board and our advisory groups on
market infrastructures.[ ] We also conduct tests in conjunction with the market rather than building
solutions in isolation. Let me give you two examples.
First, in the retail space, we set up a digital euro innovation platform to explore innovations and
applications that the digital euro could enable. The first round involved almost 70 participants – including
merchants, fintech companies, start-ups, academia, banks and other payment service providers.[ ] Market
participants identified conditional payments, i.e. payments that are triggered automatically when
predefined conditions are met, as a key driver of innovation. Using the digital euro’s standards and its
reservation of funds functionality – which would allow money to be set aside while a payment is in
progress – payment service providers could offer conditional payments throughout the euro area that go
far beyond what is available today. In online shopping transactions, for example, funds could be released
to the seller only after the buyer confirms delivery. Reimbursements could be automated and, in the case
of delayed services, refunds could be streamlined. Payment service providers would also be able to
automate business-to-business payment flows in a standardised way, helping to speed up payments,
reduce paperwork and cut costs.
Second, in wholesale markets, the Eurosystem conducted extensive exploratory work in 2024 on settling
DLT-based transactions in central bank money. Some 64 participants were involved in real and mock
transactions covering a wide range of securities and payments use cases.[ ] With a total of €1.6 billion
5

settled over a six-month period, this was the largest and most comprehensive exploratory work on
wholesale DLT settlement in the world to date.
Technology neutrality
In adapting our offering of central bank money and supporting the digital transformation of financial
services, we are technology neutral. We are not picking winners.
In retail, offering cash in both physical and digital form is in itself an example – and even a condition – of
technology neutrality. It avoids limiting the choice of paying in central bank money to the payment format.
This supports consumers’ freedom of choice. Discriminating against central bank money in digital
payments would, on the contrary, reduce this freedom.
Another example of technology neutrality is that we are designing the digital euro to remain open to new
technologies. Take privacy, for instance. The digital euro is designed to make privacy a priority, not least
by offering an offline functionality that will offer cash-like privacy. And for online payments, the Eurosystem
will only see encrypted codes for the payer and the payee. We will not see any personal information.
Moreover, we are committed to keep using the most advanced privacy-enhancing technologies suitable for
a system that must reliably and instantaneously process a considerable number of transactions every day.
In wholesale markets, we may see a future where DLT is used in some segments, traditional databases in
others, with hybrid architectures in many cases. Our objective is not to oblige market participants to use a
particular technological stack, but to ensure that whichever technology they adopt, the system remains
safe, integrated and resilient by being connected to central bank money. This is why we will offer central
bank money settlement for both DLT-based and traditional transactions. We are also neutral towards
private business models and actors, provided they operate within a robust regulatory perimeter. Market
participants should be able to innovate, but they must respect prudential and conduct requirements and
meet expectations for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.
The digital euro: establishing a European solution and a single market
for everyday retail payments
Having presented the key pillars of our approach, namely complementarity between public and private
money, public-private collaboration and technology neutrality, let me now discuss in more detail what this
approach entails for retail, wholesale and cross-border payments.
In retail payments, the digital euro will ensure all Europeans can use a European solution to pay
throughout the euro area, in shops, in ecommerce and from person to person. At the same time, the digital
euro will establish a single market for everyday retail payments by making it much easier for providers to
scale up private European solutions.
A digital equivalent of cash
For decades, cash has provided a universal means of payment that everyone could use for most
payments, thanks to its legal tender status. But as commerce becomes increasingly digital – with online

payments, for instance, now accounting for one-third of day-to-day transactions – the use of cash is
declining.
In the absence of an equivalent public option in the digital sphere, the gap has been filled by a few mostly
non-European solutions. International card schemes account for two-thirds of card transactions in the euro
area. Out of 20 euro area countries, 13 do not even have a domestic card payment solution.
This situation cannot be solved through the interoperability of existing domestic solutions. While such
interoperability can help address some challenges, it does not create domestic solutions where they do
not exist, nor does it allow existing domestic solutions to expand to use cases they do not currently cover.
Interoperability requires each participant to develop functionalities in parallel. This increases costs and
complexity, hindering scalability.
The digital euro would be fundamentally new in the European context. It would provide a European digital
means of payment in central bank money that would have legal tender status and would thus be accepted
throughout the euro area wherever one can pay digitally. For consumers, it would extend the benefits of
cash to the digital sphere. And for merchants, it would reduce costs compared with the dominant
international payment solutions, both directly and indirectly by increasing merchants’ negotiating power.
Preserving the role of banks in financing the economy
The digital euro has been designed to preserve the role of banks in the financing of the economy. In the
euro area, banks assume a key role in this regard and thus in the transmission of monetary policy. We
have no intention of disrupting this role. In fact, the digital euro will protect it.
Banks will be at the centre of the digital euro distribution; they will keep the customer relationship and
manage the digital euro accounts. This will allow them to retain data that are crucial for assessing the
creditworthiness of their clients and thus for their role in financing the economy. And we will prepare with
banks so that they are ready to distribute the digital euro. In 2027 we plan to launch a pilot offering banks
an opportunity to gain first-hand experience in a simulated digital euro ecosystem. This pilot will not only
provide the Eurosystem with valuable insights, but will also allow banks to provide feedback.[ ]
Moreover, the digital euro will allow banks to be compensated (they will continue receiving fees), while no
longer having to pay the fees charged by international card schemes (as the Eurosystem will cover
scheme and settlement costs).
And by offering a convenient payment solution, the digital euro will reduce the risk that the banks’
customers turn to alternatives. This will reduce the risk of deposit outflows to stablecoins, which could
soon represent an alternative to banks as the source of funds for payments with cards and mobile
solutions.
Several safeguards have been included in the design of the digital euro to ensure it does not
disintermediate banks. First, the digital euro will not be remunerated. Second, a link to their commercial
bank account will allow consumers to pay amounts that exceed their digital euro holdings, thereby
10

reducing their incentive to keep high digital euro holdings in the first place. And third, digital euro holding
limits will avoid any destabilising deposit outflows.[ ]
A springboard for European private solutions to expand
Moreover, the digital euro is a major opportunity for European payment service providers, including banks.
First, co-badging with digital euro would allow existing European payment solutions to expand their reach,
without losing transactions for which they are already accepted.[ ] This applies to both physical cards and
digital wallets.
Second, the digital euro would provide a single standard across Europe with unparalleled coverage given
the digital euro’s legal tender status. Using this standard would significantly reduce the cost of expanding
the acceptance network of European payment solutions. We have been working on this standard with
market participants as part of the Rulebook Development Group.[ ] This standard could be made
available shortly after the legislation is adopted and merchants would start to use it even before the digital
euro’s launch, as they seek to be “digital euro-ready” when updating their payment terminals.
Third, the digital euro would allow banks to offer new, innovative payment services at scale, for instance
using the reservation of funds functionality as I explained earlier.
Overall, this could make it much easier for current European private initiatives to achieve their objectives,
whether they are based on cross-border integration like Wero or interoperability like EuroPA. I believe
there is no dichotomy between the digital euro and European private initiatives, but instead
complementarities and synergies.
To reap these synergies, it is crucial that the digital euro and European private initiatives progress in
parallel. By aligning on digital euro standards, while making maximum use of existing standards and
building on established infrastructures as much as possible, costs will be minimised and the digital euro
will create a single market for digital retail payments.
Tokenised central bank money: powering an integrated European
market for digital assets
Let me now turn to wholesale payments.
Besides seeking to offer central bank money to settle DLT-based digital asset transactions, we aim to
fundamentally upgrade the infrastructure of our capital markets. If we want a future-proof savings and
investments union, and if we want Europe to remain competitive, then we must collectively modernise the
way financial assets are issued, traded, settled and serviced.
Europe needs to develop a market for digital assets that is based on European infrastructure, euro-
denominated settlement assets and EU-wide regulation. This will also protect our strategic autonomy,
monetary sovereignty and financial stability.

Safely unleashing the innovation potential of tokenisation
A key promise of DLT and tokenisation is to bring the full lifecycle of a financial transaction – issuance,
trading, settlement and custody – to a single digital environment. By design, this can reduce reconciliation
processes, shorten settlement chains and lower operational risk. It can also enable atomic delivery-
versus-payment and support trading and settlement on a 24/7 basis, 365 days a year, rather than being
constrained by the opening hours of legacy systems.[ ] Furthermore, smart contracts can automate
corporate actions and cash flows that today require multiple intermediaries and manual checks.
This explains the significant interest for this technology in the European market. A large share of EU banks
are experimenting with DLT applications, while a significant portion have already begun deploying them.
[ ]
But a key risk is fragmentation. If tokenised payments and finance rest on fragmented pools of private
settlement assets, liquidity can splinter and assets cannot be traded across platforms. Market participants
may need to hold multiple stablecoins just to pay different counterparties. And in stress situations, the
promise of one-to-one convertibility may be tested precisely when it matters most.
Central bank money, by contrast, is not constrained by the business model limits of private tokens. If made
usable on DLT platforms, it can support the system in times of stress by elastically providing the ultimate
liquidity. This matters not only for safety, but for the practical ability of a tokenised market to function
smoothly at high volumes.
Establishing an integrated European market for digital assets
However, structural problems cannot be fixed by technology alone.
Europe’s post-trade landscape remains fragmented. Simply look at the number of central securities
depositories across the EU, which is far higher than in other major jurisdictions. In itself, this would not be
a problem, provided infrastructures were seamlessly interoperable and operated under comparable rules.
But Europe still has too many operational frictions, legal discrepancies and national practices that make
cross-border activity costly and complex.
A recent industry study finds that post-trade fees in Europe remain materially higher than in North America,
and that fee schedules are often complex and hard to compare. Fragmentation ultimately shows up in the
cost of capital and the attractiveness of European markets.[ ]
Tokenisation creates a rare opportunity to design a European market for digital assets that is integrated
from the outset, in other words, a digital capital markets union. We must prevent the risk of creating
platforms and standards that are incompatible and recreate the market segmentation we are trying to
overcome.
We need an enabling framework that reduces legal uncertainty for tokenised securities and supports EU-
wide scalability. I therefore welcome the legislative proposals published last week by the European
Commission.[ ] They extend, enhance and expand the DLT Pilot Regime. And, in this respect, the idea of
14
15
16
17

a dedicated EU legal framework for tokenised assets – sometimes described as a “28th regime” –
captures the direction of travel.
Supporting Europe’s strategic autonomy in digital finance
Another reason to provide tokenised central bank money is to ensure a digital asset ecosystem can grow
in Europe without depending on non-European settlement assets. This is key to avoiding the creation of a
similar dependency in wholesale payments to what we have now in retail payments.
If we do not provide a euro-anchored wholesale solution and a European infrastructure for the settlement
of digital assets, Europe could find itself importing technology, standards, governance choices and
ultimately strategic dependencies. Or worse: the digital assets market could simply fail to achieve scale in
Europe and could end up growing elsewhere, which would weaken the international role of the euro and
our strategic autonomy. In contrast, offering tokenised central bank money will help European innovation
to scale up without outsourcing the monetary anchor.
So how are we implementing this strategy in practice? In July, the ECB’s Governing Council approved a
dual-track approach to settle DLT-based wholesale transactions in central bank money.[ ]
Pontes: bridging today and tomorrow
The first track, also known as Project Pontes, will deliver a regular service for settling DLT transactions in
central bank money as early as the third quarter of 2026.[ ]
Pontes is designed as a bridge between DLT platforms and our existing TARGET services. This bridge will
enable tokenised asset transactions recorded on market DLT platforms to settle in central bank money. It
will build on existing TARGET services, so it will maintain the Eurosystem’s standards for safety, resilience
and efficiency, while being cost-efficient. It will combine the features of the three solutions we used in our
exploratory work, which will enable delivery-versus-payment and support automation.
We aim to gradually enhance Pontes with new functionalities following its launch, for instance by offering
24/7 operation and settlement, or by enabling the market to deploy automated smart contracts directly on
the Eurosystem DLT.
In a nutshell, Pontes is about ensuring that, whichever DLT market platforms develop, safe euro
settlement in central bank money will be available.
Appia: the future ecosystem
The second track, Project Appia, will lay the groundwork for an integrated European digital asset
ecosystem.[ ] A launch paper to explain our vision will be published in early 2026. We want to explore
how a future European digital financial market could operate if central bank money, commercial bank
money and assets are able to interact efficiently in a tokenised environment.
Appia will explore two approaches, with the potential to combine them if needed. First, a European shared
ledger that brings together central bank money, commercial bank money and other assets on a single
18
19
20

platform where market stakeholders provide services. Second, a European network of interoperable
platforms that reduces current frictions in the market.
This is also where the public-private partnership becomes tangible. Our role is to foster trust, develop
European standards and ensure that the settlement anchor remains solid. The private sector’s role is to
build the services, liquidity, business models and possibly platforms that make tokenised markets
valuable.
If we get this right, Europe can achieve something that is both technologically advanced and economically
decisive: a tokenised market that operates at continental scale, with European rules and the euro at its
core.
Cross-border payments: openness with autonomy
Finally, we must look beyond our own borders.
Too often, cross-border payments still feel like they belong to a different era. They can be slow, expensive
and opaque. According to the G20 monitoring framework, the cost of sending a USD 200 remittance
averages around 6.5% of the transaction value globally, while the cost of business-to-business cross-
border payments averages 1.6% of the transaction value and close to one-third of cross-border retail
payments took more than one business day to be settled in 2024.[ ]
Structural factors are a significant cause of these issues. Much of the world still relies on correspondent
banking chains. This model is inherently complex, as it multiplies intermediaries, compliance checks and
points of failure, and it can require multiple currency conversions.
Against this backdrop, our objective is to build up European capability by combining openness and
improving our payment connections with partners.
Stablecoin limits
One possible trajectory is a world in which cross-border payments increasingly depend on one or a
handful of global, US-dollar-backed stablecoins distributed through dominant platforms. There are three
fundamental concerns with such an outcome.
The first is concentration and operational fragility. If global payments depend on a small number of issuers
and technology stacks, operational incidents, governance failures or runs become systemic issues rather
than firm-level problems. Stablecoins may promise frictionless transfer but they can also create
vulnerabilities in payments.
The second concern is external rule-setting via infrastructure. If the main settlement asset and rails are
anchored outside Europe, then Europe’s payment outcomes are shaped elsewhere. In a world where
payment networks can be weaponised, this is a risk to our economic security.
And third, there are currency substitution risks if the stablecoin ecosystem remains overwhelmingly dollar-
based. If these instruments achieve scale via global platforms, they can amplify digital dollarisation
dynamics – especially in regions with weaker currencies, but also by shifting the unit of account and
21

settlement conventions in digital markets. We should avoid Europe’s cross-border payments being
structurally dependent on private settlement assets denominated in another currency.
Enhancing cross-border payments
Against this backdrop, the Eurosystem has explored alternative ways to enhance cross-border payments.
TIPS already acts as a hub for instant payments within the euro area.[ ] And it is open to currencies of
European countries outside the euro area, with Sweden and Denmark already using TIPS as a platform to
run fast payments in their own currencies, and Norway soon to join. Since October, TIPS also provides the
option to make cross-currency payments between the euro area, Sweden and Denmark.
In the near future, TIPS could evolve into a global hub for instant cross-border payments by interlinking
with other fast payment systems. The Eurosystem is making progress with its work to connect TIPS with
India’s Unified Payments Interface – which has one of the largest instant payment transaction volumes in
the world – and with Nexus Global Payments, which will connect the fast payments systems of Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and India.[ ] We also announced in September that we will start
exploring the interlinking of TIPS with Switzerland’s fast payments systems, and we are in discussions with
other possible partners. The Eurosystem, through Banca d’Italia, is also supporting the central banks of
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and North Macedonia in their efforts to develop an
instant, multi-currency payments system modelled on TIPS. This “TIPS clone” is due to become
operational in July 2026, after which it will be technically possible to link it up with TIPS.
This strategy will facilitate cross-border payments, making them cheaper, faster and more transparent.
Interlinking can reduce the number of intermediaries, shorten transaction chains and lower costs, as it
allows payment service providers to transact without routing payments through a long chain of
correspondents.
However, the settlement leg of cross-border payments, by which money moves from the payer’s to the
payee’s account, is also crucial. This is why we are also exploring how tokenised settlement assets could
complement interlinking. We can build on the foundation of the BIS Innovation Hub’s Project Rialto, which
aims to improve instant cross-border payments using central bank money settlement. Other solutions
based on tokenised forms of private money can also be explored.
Looking to the future, the digital euro could also act as a connector. It is first and foremost intended for
domestic use. But it is also being designed with international use in mind, based on an approach that
respects the sovereignty of other countries and mitigates potential risks.[ ]
When visiting the euro area temporarily, non-euro area residents would have access to the digital euro
through a European payment service provider. Merchants outside the euro area may also be allowed to
accept digital euro payments from euro area residents. Moreover, users outside the euro area could be
granted permanent access to the digital euro, subject to an agreement between the EU and non-EU
countries, and complemented by an arrangement between the ECB and the respective central banks.
Appropriate safeguards would be put in place to avoid stoking currency substitution in those countries.
22

Finally, like TIPS, the digital euro’s design includes multi-currency enabling features that would allow non-
euro area countries to use the digital euro infrastructure to offer their own digital currencies and facilitate
transactions across these currencies.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
In a rapidly digitalising economy where new technologies are emerging, we need to ensure central bank
money remains fit for purpose. This is key for innovation, integration and independence in digital payments
and digital finance.
This is of particular importance in the European context. As Mario Draghi has underlined, Europe’s
problem is that innovation is often blocked by fragmented markets at the scale-up stage, pushing
successful firms to seek scale elsewhere. Digital payments are a case in point and we need to avoid
digital finance following the same path.
This is highly relevant for Europe’s competitiveness. Digital payments and finance stand at the interface
between technology and the financial system, which together explain most of the productivity gap between
Europe and the United States.[ ]
In this context, our strategy is neither state-centric nor hands-off, rather it is built around three principles.
First, central bank money must remain available and usable, also in digital form, to provide stability and
trust.
Second, our approach is based on public-private partnership. The Eurosystem provides settlement in
central bank money and common standards, while private intermediaries compete and innovate on top of
this, delivering services that are innovative and scalable.
Third, we do not decide which technology or business models should prevail. This is up to market
participants. The public sector’s role is to ensure that our payment systems and our financial system
remain robust in the face of technological disruption and that markets for money and assets remain fully
integrated.
In retail payments, the digital euro is about ensuring that people in Europe can continue to use public
money by complementing cash with its digital equivalent. This keeps pace with the shift of commerce
towards digital payments. Its infrastructure, acceptance network and standards will also make it easier for
European private solutions to scale up.
In wholesale payments, Pontes in the short term and Appia in the longer term will make it possible to settle
digital asset transactions in central bank money. This will provide a safe basis for tokenisation to scale in
Europe.
In cross-border payments, we can increase speed and reduce costs by interlinking fast payment systems
and exploring innovative settlement arrangements.
25

The choice, ultimately, is about whether Europe wants to sit on the sidelines watching the next wave of
innovative payment solutions, or be a co-architect of an innovative, integrated and resilient digital financial
system that has the euro at its core.
By acting now, as part of a public-private partnership, we can play a leading role in the transformation of
money and we can embrace innovation. This will support Europe’s competitiveness, resilience and
sovereignty, while delivering tangible benefits for European people and businesses.
Thank you for your attention.

Decentralised ledger technology allows information to be shared and kept synchronised across a network.
Tokenisation is the process of converting or issuing assets as programmable tokens. Tokenisation allows
programmable tokens to carry two sets of information at the same time: information about the asset itself
(what it is, who issued it, who holds it, etc.) and the rules about how this token can be used (who can hold
it, how it can change ownership, as well as more complex rules compiled into smart contracts).
