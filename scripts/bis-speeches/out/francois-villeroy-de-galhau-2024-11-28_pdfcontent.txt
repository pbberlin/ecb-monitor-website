Ladies and Gentlemen, Liebe Freunde, 
I am delighted to be with you today at the 2024 Frankfurt European Banking Congress, 
especially for this joint  session with my Bundesbank colleague and friend Joachim 
Nagel. Europe obviously has a growth problem . Recent trends were already set to 
widen the gapi while since 1999, GDP per capita growth has been slower in the euro 
area (+26% vs +39% in the US). A  significant part of the gap is due to the last five 
years: since 2019 and Covid, GDP per capita only increased by 2.5% in the euro area 
compared with 7.9% in the US. The outcome of the US election must obviously serve 
as another wake-up call. The future US economic policy is still uncertain in its details, 
but not in its probable direction: more tariffs, more fiscal deficits, less regulation 
including in finance. And this could mean more risks for the global economy: more 
inflation – especially in the US –, more financial volatility, less trade and hence less 
growth including for Europe. Joachim and I nevertheless believe that Europe still has 
the levers to master its economic destiny and strengthen its growth: this is why we will 
issue today a common call . But let me  first dispel three  common misconceptions 
regarding Central banks and growth.  
1) “Central banks don’t care about growth” 
True, our primary objective is and should remain price stability. We are clearly in the 
process of reining in inflation, which stood at 1.7% in September and 2.0% in October 
in the euro area, down from a peak  of 10.6% two years earlier. This sharp decrease 
clearly warranted the third rate cut in October.
ii Despite possible ups and downs over 
coming months, we  are very confident that we will sustainably reach our 2% target . 
We should even get there earlier than expected in 2025 compared with our September 
forecasts.iii  
Our past monetary tightening has neither caused a recession in the euro area as a 
whole, nor substantially raised unemployment which remains at its historical low (6.3% 
for the euro area). In short, the European economy is achieving a soft landing largely 
thanks to central banks’ credibility. iv Price stability is a necessary condition for trust, 
and hence for growth. We are not behind the curve today, and looking forward, we will 
determine the pace of our further monetary easing in a pragmatic way, and following 
a data-driven and meeting-by-meeting approach, as President Lagarde stressed.v We

are confident that victory against inflation is in sight, but we will pay close attention to 
the balance of risks and to its symmetry, including the possible risk of undershooting 
our inflation target, and of keeping economic activity unnecessarily subdued. 
2) “Today, reviving growth is contingent on fiscal stimulus” 
I will not make any comments about German fiscal policy: it’s a different and specific 
case, and I am aware how acute the political debate is. But let me speak about most 
other European countries, including my own. Fiscal policies have responded to the 
recent series of crises – Covid and the Russian war in Ukraine – by providing strong 
support. Many countries now face high debt levels, with an average of roughly 88% of 
GDP in the euro area as of mid-2024.vi Meanwhile, the effects on activity of persistent 
fiscal deficits have overall proved disappointing over the long term and still more in 
France, Spain and Italy. Indeed,  when public debt is too high, Keynesian effects of 
stimulus on aggregate demand are dampened by consumers’ expectations that such 
measures will have to be paid back in the future  through higher levies, and more 
generally their fear of uncertainty. It probably helps explain why the euro area savings 
rate still recently increased , from 13 .1% to 15.7 % between the end of the second 
quarters of 2022 and 2024;  and why consumption has hence so far remained more 
sluggish than expected, even though households’ real disposable income has risen. 
Notwithstanding the specific German situation, a ll these elements point in the same 
direction: in many countries fiscal consolidation is needed, and now is a good time to 
do so. Let me by the way stress a misunderstanding about  Eurobonds and common 
public funding of investments in the Draghi report:vii as a non-starter for Germany and 
other Member States at this stage, it can be disconnected from  the other report’s 
recommendations. Let us at this stage focus positively on these recommendations,  
which are numerous, decisive and costless. Mario Draghi himself gave no figures, and 
pointed out that “it’s not the main thing of the report”. viii But shared private funding, 
through the Savings and Investment Union, is of the essence. As emphasised by Gita 
Gopinath, First Deputy Managing Director of the IMF , most governments need to 
undertake a “strategic pivot”ix and focus their efforts on structural policies to meet the 
major challenges of growth in the coming years.   
3) “Central banks should only talk about monetary policy”

Should central banks only talk about monetary policy ? Actually not , for several 
reasons. In Europe – including at the Bundesbank and the Banque de France –, there 
is a long tradition of central banks freely providing their expertise on economic topics 
other than those strictly related to inflation or interest rates. Thanks to the Deutsche 
Bundesbank, independence is a German heritage, which I cherish, and i t is a g reat 
chance to have central banks’ independent expertise . In today’s world where  supply 
shocks are decisive and will be more and more frequent,x promoting structural policies 
is still more essential and in the interest of price stability . As central bankers, we are 
not the decision-makers here, this is up to governments. But it is our duty to help keep 
supply-side reforms at centre stage, all the more so since political authorities are at 
present often weakened, as they are unfortunately more subject to strong short-term 
and domestic pressures.  
Central banks have built their credibility on monetary policy through decades of 
tenacious action and communication. They must now sometimes use this credibility 
to call beyond monetary policy, as price stability and financial stability will also depend 
on broader economic levers. If we do not defend open trade, with fair rules, who will? 
Or if we do not plead for more financial integration in Europe, who will?

This is why Joachim Nagel and I want to issue now, here in Frankfurt, a common call. 
By doing so, we also echo Konrad Adenauer, who was Chancellor from 1949 to 1963: 
“When everybody else thinks it’s the end, we have to begin ”. Thank you for your 
attention.
