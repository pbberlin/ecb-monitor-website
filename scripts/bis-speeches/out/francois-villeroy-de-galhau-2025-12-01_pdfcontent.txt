The competitiveness of the banking
sector: a few insights into a major
challenge for France and Europe

Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am delighted to welcome you to this year’s ACPR Conference focusing
on the resilience of the financial sector and, on this fifteenth anniversary,
the ACPR itself is a fine example of resilience. I would like to kick off this
morning with an essential component, namely the competitiveness of
the French and European banking sector. Granted, from a legal
perspective, this is not part of the ACPR's mandate, but there is no need
for any change in legislation for this subject to be of long-standing
importance for us too: it relates to the strength and innovative capacity
of our financial system. It lies at the heart of our economic sovereignty
and needs to be treated seriously as well as with clarity. First, let us
consider the facts: French banks are financially sound aside from a
temporary lag in profitability due to the predominance of fixed-rate
loans, however the real challenge is at the transatlantic level (I). Next, let
us analyse certain explanations that are often put forward – regulation
and payments – with discernment (II). Lastly, let us broaden the outlook
around two decisive drivers, i.e. the size of financial institutions and
public support (III). 
I. The facts: structural soundness and
a transatlantic challenge
1.1 A temporary lag, reflecting a protective
fixed-rate model
Let us begin with a lucid but nuanced overview. Yes, French banks are
currently lagging behind their European counterparts in terms of their
profitability ratios. Since interest rates began to rise in 2022, a difference
has appeared in the asset yields between French and European banks.

Return on equity is also lower, averaging 6.7% over the same period for
French banks, compared with 11.2% for comparable SSM banks. This lag
is real, but it should be temporary. It is mainly due to the predominance
of fixed-rate loans, limiting the growth in interest income when interest
rates rise (inertia of previously low rates). Conversely, during periods of
extremely low rates, French banks' interest income, although lower,
declined less sharply than that of comparable Spanish or Italian banks.
This French model has a short-term cost for institutions, but it protects
borrowers and limits the cost of risk.
However, we need to look at the bigger picture. French banks remain
among Europe’s strongest, with high average capitalisation levels –
higher than their European counterparts – rigorous risk management,
and a proven ability to adapt.

They are also among the most diversified, with the share of income
related to commissions and market activities nearly twice as high as their
euro area peers, and universal business models that afford them
valuable resilience.
1.2 The real challenge: bridging the
transatlantic gap
The gap in competitiveness is most pronounced – and most worrying –
between European and American banks.

European banks as a whole struggle to compete with large American
institutions, which benefit from a dynamic domestic market with high
margins, particularly in investment banking. The figures speak for
themselves: US investment banking revenues are around three times
higher than those of European banks. 
II. Examining with discernment two
traditional explanations put forward
by the sector: regulation and
payments
2.1 Regulation: simplifying without
deregulating
image ImageThématique Banques Catégorie Discours


Financial regulation is frequently mentioned to explain the difference in
competitiveness between European and American banks. Yes, the
European regulatory framework is dense – sometimes overly – but no,
the solution cannot lie in deregulation. Financial stability is a common
good that aims to prevent the immeasurable costs of banking and
financial crises. Let’s not be too quick to forget 2008, especially when
financial stability appears to be fragile, across equity, cryptocurrencies,
and private credit markets. It is not a question of choosing between
robustness and efficiency, but of reconciling the two. We need to aim for
ambitious simplification: there is room for improvement in Europe for
making things less complex without making them less secure. A year
ago, right here, I put forward proposals to this effect.
 
In this same spirit, we now need to review the simplification initiative
launched at European level. Progress has been made in several areas,
especially in supervision and reporting. The SSM has taken the first
tangible steps in relation to the Next Level Supervision initiative: greater
efficiency and focus on risk through digitalisation, standardised and
faster processes, and fewer unnecessary charges. In early October, the
European Banking Authority proposed 21 simplification measures to ease
the reporting burden, which will be implemented in the very near future
for the entities within its remit. These are a step in the right direction and
we support their expansion and their effective rapid implementation.
On regulation itself, we have participated in the ECB's High-Level Task
Force, and in December it will submit its proposals to the Commission to
contribute to the overall “review” next year. There are ways to simplify
without deregulating, but this cannot involve imposing additional
requirements on European banks: the results of the latest very stringent
stress tests published on 1 August 2025 show that these banks are
sufficiently capitalised, both collectively and individually. I am specifically
referring to the removal of thresholds that trigger the maximum
distributable amount related to MREL and leverage frameworks. I am also
referring to the streamlining of the resolution framework by achieving a
better fit with the TLAC international standard. We also need to rethink
certain overly complex aspects of European regulation, such as the
systemic risk buffer (SyRB), which does not exist anywhere else. There is
scope for merging or even eliminating certain buffers.
i

 
Let's face it: there is also room for simplification at the national level. To
cite just one example, the Banque de France and the ACPR remain more
committed than any other institution to the fight against climate change,
however, the reporting requirements in place for four years under Article
29 of the Energy and Climate Act  (LEC29) specific to France are of
very little use and fit very poorly with the related European provisions.
Moreover, AI could help us to “streamline” a lot of existing legislation in
the future.
 
 
2.2 Digital euro and tokenisation: we must not
fight the wrong battle
A second factor that is sometimes mentioned is payments, particularly
with regards to digital currencies. And here again, erroneous debates
must be avoided. The issue is not public versus private. It is rather
Europe versus the United States. It is transatlantic, not intra-European. 
 
We are indeed confronted with a twofold challenge to sovereignty:

•    Regarding payments: every day we use the services provided by two
major US “schemes” that account for 69% of all card transactions in the
euro area (in the second half of 2024); although, fortunately, this rate is
less than 30% in France thanks to the strength of the GIE Cartes
Bancaires infrastructure.  
•    Regarding currency: the US administration is promoting the surge in
stablecoins, 99% of which are backed by the US dollar, raising the risk of
“privatisation” and “dollarisation” of our currency.
 
Firstly, we actively and urgently support the development of a wholesale
central bank digital currency, which will allow banks to benefit from
settlement in a central bank money in a tokenised environment. It
represents a decisive step forward in the modernisation of financial
infrastructures and in European monetary sovereignty. And there is
general consensus here, but it must go hand-in-hand with the
development of a tokenised private currency, in euro, which could take
the form of tokenised bank deposits or euro-based stablecoins issued by
banks. Europe could have both, but it would be a terrible mistake to have
neither.
As for retail payments, the digital euro is one of the keys to the solution.
Let us move beyond the sometimes surprising excess of emotion and
passion surrounding this issue. The Eurosystem is designing the digital
euro in a logic of “public-private partnership” with banks, which will play
a central role in its distribution. It will not threaten European private
payment solutions, but rather it will be a catalyst: we are fully behind
Wero, which recently joined forces with other national mobile payment
solutions (such as Bizum in Spain) within the EuroPA consortium. The
digital euro will assist these solutions by facilitating the development of
open and harmonised acceptance standards throughout the euro area.
This partnership will thus strengthen the competitiveness of European
banks; on the contrary, if we do not develop it, European dependence on
US technology and financial giants will deepen.
III. Broadening the outlook around
two key drivers – size and public
iii

support
3.1 Size: a structural handicap
European banks are too fragmented; too small on a global scale. 45% of
US bank assets are owned by the five largest banks, whereas in Europe,
this ratio is only about 33%. Moreover, US banking group subsidiaries
play a significant and increasing role in market activities and investment
banking: they account for over 55% of investment banking commissions
in Europe.
The size of European banks limits their ability to invest heavily in the
technologies of tomorrow – artificial intelligence, quantum computing
and cybersecurity – as these investments entail high fixed costs, which
larger institutions can better absorb.
We must therefore remove the political and regulatory obstacles that
hinder the creation of cross-border European champions – by
reinvigorating the Banking Union. The Savings and Investment Union – it
has not been stressed often enough – draws together the Banking Union
and the Capital Markets Union, uniting them rather than pitting them
against each other. We have more than a decade of effective SSM
supervision behind us; it is high time that we learn from this experience
so that liquidity and capital can flow more freely within banking groups
and their subsidiaries in the Banking Union. We must revisit the criteria,
which today are too strict, for granting waivers allowing for the
consolidated management of liquidity requirements within European
groups. And we must go further by removing Pillar 2 requirements for
subsidiaries within the SSM and by introducing the possibility of waivers
that favour the management of capital that is itself consolidated in
Europe. 
As for the deposit guarantee, rather than always chasing the dream of a
complete system, of a “fully-fledged EDIS”, a decisive step would be to
create a European liquidity support scheme, between national guarantee
schemes, which would act as a safety net. I have already suggested it,
as has my German colleague, Joachim Nagel.  iv

3.2 The need for a public strategy
The banking and financial sector is a strategic strength for France and
for Europe. And for France in Europe, since our country possesses the
largest financial industry in Europe. It cannot be solely perceived as a
source of risk or tax revenues. It must be recognised as a vector of
sovereignty and competitiveness. This is certainly true in retail banking –
which often attracts more political attention – and is no less true in
investment banking, which is crucial both for financing our three major
transformations – digital technology and AI, decarbonised energy, and
defence – and for boosting companies' equity capital in order to close
our innovation gap.
The United States grasped this a long time ago. Its support for its
financial institutions is strategic, even if excessive deregulation would be
dangerous. And this is a lesson we have to learn. Over 25 years ago,
Europe won its monetary sovereignty with the tremendous success of
the euro. Today, faced with the current US administration’s offensive, the
Draghi   and Letta   reports set out a clear path for a new “leap in
sovereignty”. But there will be no economic sovereignty without financial
sovereignty. And that means consistent tax policies, moderating
regulatory temptations, including at the national level, and a shared
European ambition.
**
The competitiveness of the French and European banking sector is a
major strategic issue. It is not simply a matter of ratios or rankings. It
affects our ability to finance our economy, support transitions and
defend our model. We have the means: robust banks, committed
regulators, a common and well-recognised currency. But we must
remove the obstacles: complex regulations, market fragmentation, a lack
of strategic vision. This is the ambition that we are committed to,
working together, for a stronger European banking sector. Thank you.
