SPEECH
The analytics of the monetary policy tightening
cycle
Guest lecture by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of
the ECB, at Stanford Graduate School of Business
Stanford, 2 May 2024
Introduction
My aim today is to review the ECB’s monetary policy tightening cycle." The tightening began in
December 2021 with the announcement of the end date for our net purchases under the pandemic
emergency purchase programme (PEPP), as well as the recalibration and subsequent phase-out of
our targeted lending programme. After concluding net purchases under the PEPP in March 2022 and
net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) in June 2022, we subsequently normalised
our policy rate (the deposit facility rate [DFR] in conditions of abundant excess liquidity) from -0.5 per
cent to 2 per cent in the second half of 2022, before raising rates further into restrictive territory during
the first nine months of 2023 to a level of 4.0 per cent. We have held the DFR constant at this level
over the last five meetings since our last hike in September (Chart 1).!2!
This was an especially striking tightening campaign in view of the prevailing highly-accommodative
monetary stance, which consisted of very low levels of the policy rate that had been in place over the
last decade, the considerable net asset purchasing under the APP since 2015 and under the PEPP
since 2020 and the scale and pricing of the targeted long-term refinancing operations. In late 2021,
this stance was still expected to be maintained over the medium term: for instance, the median
respondent in the December 2021 Survey of Monetary Analysts expected the deposit facility rate to
remain in negative territory until the first quarter of 2025 and net purchases under the APP to continue
until June 2023. It follows that, relative the path expected in late 2021, the tightening cycle constituted
a major surprise. Of course, the underlying driving force for the tightening cycle was the very large
surprise increase in inflation, especially in 2022, after the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine. A
defining feature is that a significant component of the stance tightening is expected to be persistent in
nature, with rates only expected to descend to the neighbourhood of a more neutral level, while
quantitative easing and targeted refinancing operations are not expected to be resumed.

22 July 2022, 16 December 2022, 9 February 2024, and 29 April 2024.
The aim of this lecture is to review this tightening cycle from an analytical perspective. The tightening
cycle had two basic aims. First, during an extended period in which inflation was far above our target,
it was imperative to unwind a monetary stance that would have been too accommodative relative to
the rapid shift in expected inflation over the relevant policy horizon. Second, given the scale of the
surprise inflation in 2021-2022, it was essential to contain the propagation of the inflation shock
through the subsequent price-wage adjustment phases. While corrective waves of price and wage
resetting were inescapable, a monetary stance that ensured that demand would be dampened and
that inflation would return to the target in a timely manner would be needed to ensure an orderly
adjustment phase that did not risk embedding above-target inflation into longer-term inflation
expectations.
In calibrating the speed and scale of monetary tightening in the context of the post-pandemic recovery
and extraordinary surge in energy prices (including due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine), several
considerations were paramount.
First, lags in monetary transmission were inevitable: it would take time for monetary policy to exert its
full impact on inflation.
Second, the descent of inflation from its peak would be assisted by the reversal of some of the factors
driving the inflation surge: the easing of supply bottlenecks; the likely expansion of energy supply and
contraction in energy demand in response to the spectacular increases in oil and gas prices; and the
gradual re-normalisation of the economy through the fading out of pandemic-related distortions in
sectoral supply and demand patterns. That is, the calibration of monetary policy should take account
the temporary nature of some of the shocks, while making sure that these temporary shocks would not
convert into permanent inflation through the de-anchoring of inflation expectations.


Third, the calibration needed to allow for various types of uncertainty. Along one dimension, there was
uncertainty about the intrinsic persistence of the inflation process. In addition to the standard
uncertainty about the feedback dynamics by which price increases in one period would trigger
subsequent price and wage increases in following periods, the scale of inflation during 2022 also led to
shifts in behaviour, with firms switching to more frequent pricing resets. While this added to the
intensity of inflation, it also held out the possibility that the overall adjustment process could be front-
loaded.!2! Ultimately, the persistence of inflation would turn on the scale of de-anchoring of inflation
expectations, which warranted close monitoring.
Along a second dimension, there was uncertainty about the strength of transmission of monetary
policy in view of possible shifts in the economic, financial and monetary environment. First and
foremost, the many years of low inflation and the strategic commitment by central banks to deliver the
inflation target over the medium term provided a strong foundation for containing the inflation shock,
compared to the costly de-anchoring dynamics observed in the 1970s. Compared to previous
tightening cycles, it was also important to take into account trend shifts in: the sectoral composition of
activity (which, among other things, can affect the overall degree of price rigidity in the economy, the
interest sensitivity of demand and the overall sensitivity of activity levels to domestic demand); the
state of the labour market; the scale of leverage among households and firms; the state of the banking
system (which had been stabilised following regulatory reforms and intensified supervision with the
introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism) in relation to capital levels, the risk profiles of loan
books (including due to the beneficial impact of borrower-based macroprudential measures) and bond
holdings, together with the risk profile of liability structures; and, finally, structural exposures to interest
rate movements (with a substantial increase in the share of fixed-rate mortgages).
In addition to trend shifts, the pandemic itself had resulted in lower leverage and more robust balance
sheets, due to forced savings during the pandemic and the scale of fiscal transfers to households and
firms. Furthermore, monetary tightening could be taking hold at the same time as a projected rebound
in economic activity might protect employment levels, with firms holding onto workers in anticipation of
post-pandemic normalisation. Working in the opposite direction, Russia’s unjustified war against
Ukraine had triggered a major increase in economic uncertainty, while the surge in imported energy
prices constituted a major terms of trade shock that substantially reduced real incomes and purchasing
power: these forces were independently likely to dampen consumption and investment for any given
level of monetary restriction.
Along a third dimension, the nature of the monetary configuration also created uncertainty about the
tightening process. After many years of expanding the central bank balance sheet (which had further
accelerated during the pandemic), the required shift in the monetary stance called for an exit from net
asset purchases and a pull back from the longer-term refinancing operations that had pumped liquidity
into the banking system, in addition to the lifting of the policy rate. In the absence of historical
benchmarks for this exit process, there was a wide range of views about the possible impact on the
financial system. In addition, since both balance sheet normalisation and the lifting of policy rates were
simultaneously proceeding at a global level, there was also uncertainty about the strength of
international spillovers in the tightening process. 2


A final uncertainty dimension related to the modelling of monetary policy. The ECB maintains a suite of
macroeconomic models in order to provide robust underpinnings for forecasting and policy analysis.
The projected impact of shifts in monetary policy varies across these models, in line with differences in
the specification of the economic and financial environment and, crucially, in the sensitivity of inflation
expectations to policy actions.
Taken together, these various types of uncertainty underlined the importance of taking a data-
dependent approach to the calibration of monetary policy that would take into account the evolving
inflation outlook, the realised path for underlying inflation indicators and the incoming evidence on the
strength of monetary policy transmission.
| will now provide an analytical review of the transmission of monetary policy tightening to: the financial
and banking systems; the economy; and, finally, inflation. | will also briefly draw some lessons from the
tightening period for the conduct of monetary policy during the next phase of the cycle.
Transmission to financial markets and the banking sector
Our policy rate hikes and the phasing out of asset purchases have been passed smoothly to money
markets, risk-free rates, risk assets and lending rates by banks.
Transmission via market interest rates
The money market is the immediate locus in the transmission of monetary policy. Our key ECB interest
rates have a direct impact on the rates prevailing in that market, while our balance sheet policies also
play an important role. The transmission of the steep increase in our policy rates to unsecured money
market rates has been smooth and complete. This is essential for a proper transmission as the euro
short-term rate (ESTR) and expectations about its future path form the basis of the entire euro area
risk-free rate curve: the overnight index swap (OIS) rates. In the secured money market, rates saw
some imperfect pass-through in late 2022 as the revaluation of bonds contributed to a temporary
scarcity of collateral. Our measures (such as securities lending, cash collateral, and changed
remuneration of government deposits) have helped to successfully restore full transmission in that part
of the money market as well.
As we returned to our policy rates as the primary instruments for steering the monetary policy stance
in 2022, the understanding in the market of how we decide the key ECB interest rates has become
pivotal again. This understanding contributes to the formation of expectations of market participants
about the future path of interest rates and thereby has an immediate impact on medium- to longer-term
interest rates, which are particularly consequential for the economy. ECB staff analysis of euro area
risk-free rates and inflation-linked swap (ILS) rates suggests that financial markets have rapidly
internalised the ECB’s pattern of reaction to changes in the inflation outlook. As a result, the gradual
upward shift of the €STR forward curve throughout the tightening cycle (Chart 1) was more than
proportional to the upward shift in market-based measures of inflation compensation (Chart 2),
bringing real interest rates in the euro area from deeply negative to firmly positive levels.

Notes: “Latest” refers to fixings with a cut-off date of 29 April 2024.The latest observations are for March 2024 for
realised HICP (monthly data).
When annual HICP inflation stood at 5 per cent in December 2021, markets were still pricing in a
steady return of inflation to 2 per cent by the end of 2022. The repeated upward surprises in inflation
thereafter caused an upward repricing of risk-free rates and of measures of inflation compensation, yet
without signs that markets were misrepresenting our reaction function or that they were expecting
inflation to stay permanently high. In fact, the inflation path priced into measures of inflation
compensation and ECB staff analysis that seeks to extract the genuine inflation expectations
component indicate that longer-term inflation expectations have remained well anchored close to 2 per
cent throughout this episode.
The continued anchoring of inflation expectations also helps explain another pattern in euro risk-free
rates that has caused concerns among some observers: the slope of the risk-free curve — as
measured by the difference between the OIS-ILS spread at a ten-year compared to two-year maturity
— has been negative for over a year now and even stood at -0.8 in June 2023, a record-low level since
the launch of the euro (Chart 3). Historically in the euro area and elsewhere, an inverted yield curve
has often preceded economic recessions. While the euro area economy has been stagnating, fears
of a deep and long recession have proven unfounded. At the current juncture, the negative slope of the
yield curve points to an assessment by markets which is directionally in line with ours: short-term
interest rates stand at high and firmly restrictive levels but medium to longer-term rates are lower, as
inflation and with it our policy rates are set to decline over time. In other words, the current inversion of
the yield curve indicates expectations of an eventual normalisation of inflation towards 2 per cent and
of interest rates towards more neutral levels.

Longer-term risk-free rates increased in the euro area not only on account of higher expected policy
rates, but also due to other measures taken by us and central banks globally. In particular, the phasing
out of asset purchases has had an additional tightening effect via the decompression of term premia.
Since December 2021, more than one third of the 280 basis point increase in the ten-year euro area
OIS rate is estimated by our staff to result from an increase in term premia stemming from quantitative
tightening and other factors. Indeed, the ongoing reduction (both realised and expected) of the
Eurosystem bond holdings has been the main driver behind the increase in sovereign risk premia —
and, given the no-arbitrage condition, in risk-free term premia — as duration risk is added back into the
market (Chart 4).

Notes: The chart shows the estimated impact of APP and PEPP holdings on the GDP-weighted sovereign risk
premium of sovereign bonds for the big-four sovereign issuers (Germany, France, Italy and Spain). Impacts are
derived on the basis of an arbitrage-free affine model of the term structure with a quantity factor (see Eser, F.,
Lemke, W., Nyholm, K., Radde, S. and Vladu, A. L. (2023), “Tracing the Impact of the ECB’s Asset Purchase
Program on the Yield Curve”, International Journal of Central Banking). Tne upper range of the blue area, i.e. the
smaller impact estimates are based on the baseline version of the model, while the lower range of the blue area,
i.e. the greater impact series are based on an alternative version of the model informed by the yield reactions to
the March 2020 PEPP announcement. The latest observations are for March 2024.
Our policy tightening has also been reflected in sovereign bond markets, which have coped well with
the rapid increase in interest rates. Sovereign bonds serve as a key reference asset to price other
bonds and as an important determinant of overall financial conditions within economies. ECB staff
analysis also confirms that sovereign stress impairs the transmission of monetary policy to the real
economy and eventually to inflation. Looking at the euro area as a whole, GDP-weighted euro area
sovereign bond yields have moved largely in lockstep with risk-free rates in recent years. As a result,
the ten-year yield spread over the OIS rate has been fairly stable (Chart 5). While the increase in
interest rates and the decline of the Eurosystem balance sheet have induced upward pressure on
longer-term bond yields, the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), including the in-built
flexibility applied to reinvestments, and the transmission protection instrument (TPI) have been
important elements in our monetary toolkit. It is plausible that the remarkably smooth transmission of
the forceful tightening cycle to the sovereign bond market would not have been possible to the same
extent without PEPP flexibility and the TPI. The EU-wide solidarity embodied in the NGEU programme
has also played a vital role in reducing risk premia.

Finally, the exchange rate response has been relatively muted over the tightening cycle. The euro has
remained broadly stable against the US dollar(Chart 6). This is largely due to the considerable degree
of synchronicity of the tightening cycle.

Transmission via the banking sector


The transmission of the restrictive monetary policy stance to bank lending conditions has evolved over
the course of the tightening cycle. In general, the cost of funding for banks depends both on their
sources of funding and the term structure of interest rates. Bank bond yields responded quickly to the
tightening monetary policy (Chart 7). And while the pass-through from our policy rates to the average
rates that banks apply to deposits has been partial and relatively slow, time deposit rates, especially
those of firms, have tracked policy rate hikes rather closely (Chart 8).
One contributor to the asymmetry in the response of returns on different segments of bank funding to
monetary policy was that banks had been reluctant to pass on negative interest rates to their retail
depositors during the highly accommodative phase, driving a negative spread between the
remuneration of customer deposits and the interest banks were receiving on reserves. As a corollary,
banks were initially slow to raise deposit rates in order to restore traditional margins. In addition, the
high amount of central bank liquidity and the low demand for credit also limited the pressure to
increase deposit rates. Furthermore, a lack of competition in some member countries also reduced the
pass through to deposit rates.
Over the period since September 2023 in which we have held our policy rates constant, bank bond
yields have declined somewhat, in part reflecting the anticipation of future rate cuts, while deposit rates
have continued to increase, as competition for deposits intensifies and depositors shift funds from
lower remuneration overnight deposits towards more attractive time deposits.

Banks have passed on their increased funding costs to firms and, to a slightly lesser extent,
households in mortgage lending (Chart 9). Interest rates on new lending increased rapidly, peaking
soon after the last rate hike in September 2023, but have been edging down recently. However,
average lending rates on the outstanding stock of loans have continued to increase. This reflects the
ongoing transmission of past rate hikes, as loans that were granted in the past at lower rates reprice.

The annual growth rate of lending to firms and households declined sharply over the tightening cycle
but is now also showing signs of stabilisation, albeit at low levels. According to the most recent bank
lending survey (BLS), net demand for new bank loans by firms is still declining, as the high interest
rate environment keeps external financing costs elevated and the weak growth environment means
that firms are postponing fixed investment plans (Chart 10). At the same time, banks reported a
modest net tightening of bank credit standards for loans to firms, mainly on account of increased risk
perception (Chart 11)
Evidence from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) is consistent with the
weakness in bank lending to firms (Chart 12 and Chart 13). Firms participating in SAFE have reported
a continued deterioration in bank loan availability, although this has eased from previous rounds and
firms do expect a small improvement in credit supply over the next three months. There has also been
a sharp drop in the share of firms applying for a bank loan, a continuation of the trend that began late
last year. At the same time, firms signalled less reliance on bank loans, which might reflect sufficient
internal funds and/or easier access to non-bank external funding, together with the postponement of
investment plans due to a slowing economy or expectations of lower interest rates later this year.
Turning to lending conditions to households, the BLS results point to tentative stabilisation in net
demand for new loans to households, while credit standards on household mortgages eased for the
first time in two years (Chart 14 and Chart 15). Taken together, the information from these surveys is
consistent with persistently-weak credit demand and stabilisation in credit supply conditions to firms
and households at tight levels.

In comparison to previous hiking cycles, the flow of credit to firms has declined more quickly since the
start of our policy rate hikes (Chart 16). The decline in credit observed so far in the current cycle has
been stronger than historical regularities would suggest, based on linear models. The particularly large
and rapid increase in policy rates may have amplified the tightening impulse. This may have activated
two specific amplification channels operating through bank and firm balance sheets. The first is a risk-
taking channel, in which large policy rate hikes increase the riskiness of borrowers, reducing the
capacity and willingness to lend.©! The second is a signalling channel, through which rapid rate hikes
might foreshadow a deterioration in future economic conditions, reducing the expected revenues and
increasing the expected future funding costs of potential borrowers, leading them to reduce their
demand for credit. Staff estimates suggest that the actual contraction in credit has been more in line
with a path that incorporates such non-linear effects in transmission operating through bank and firm
balance sheets (Chart 17).
The availability of liquidity to the banking system is also playing a role in the transmission to bank
lending. Estimates by ECB staff suggest that banks with lower excess liquidity are more likely to
reduce their supply of credit in response to policy rate hikes, and the increase in their lending rates is
likely to be larger (Chart 18). This means that, as aggregate liquidity shrinks, the transmission of our
restrictive monetary policy stance to bank lending may strengthen.
Finally, institutional factors, such as banking supervision and macroprudential policies, play a
significant role in shaping the risk-taking behaviour of banks. Both supranational and centralised bank


supervision can reduce unwarranted risk taking by banks, while encouraging lending to better
performing firms.“°l Sound macroprudential policies can also complement monetary policy by
increasing the resilience of the financial system.“ Such frameworks, which have been put in place
over the past decade, have strengthened the banking sector, and allow for a more orderly transmission
of monetary policy, thus reinforcing monetary policy's ability to fulfil its mandate of ensuring price
stability141

Notes: The relevant policy rate is the Deutsche Bundesbank’s Lombard rate up to December 1998, the ECB’s
main refinancing operations rate up to May 2014 and the ECB’s deposit facility rate thereafter. Total credit covers
loans and debt securities. Monetary financial institutions loans are adjusted for sales and securitisation and cash
pooling. The starting months correspond to the month immediately preceding the cycle’s first hike or the explicit
announcement of the hike. Hiking cycles are considered to have begun in: June 1988, October 1999, November
2005 and May 2022. The dotted line shows a counterfactual for lending volumes, taking December 2021 as the
latest observation and projecting volumes conditional on the path of monetary policy rates based on the BVAR
model in Altavilla, C., Giannone, D., and Lenza, M. (2016), “The Financial and Macroeconomic Effects of the OMT
Announcements’, International Journal of Central Banking, Vol. 12, No 3, pp 29-57. The latest observations are
for March 2024 for total credit to firms and for April 2024 for the policy rate.

Notes: The estimates are based on local projections that are non-linear in the shock sign and magnitude. For
each month, the predicted change in credit growth is the sum of weighted, lagged, impulses, where the impulses
depend on the size of the policy change, and the weight is the change in the policy rate h periods in the past. The
decomposition is achieved by computing the fitted change for the linear model (in yellow), and the non-linear
model where only speed or strength is allowed to vary with the size of the rate change. The latest observations

assets. The size of the bubbles measures the outstanding amounts of loans to firms for banks belonging to each

Transmission to the economy
The restrictive policy stance has also been feeding through to economic activity. Economic activity has
been stagnating throughout 2023 and started to recover at the beginning of 2024 (Chart 19). In terms
of the demand components, public consumption has been the main consistent driver of growth, while
private consumption and external demand have remained subdued in recent quarters. Weak housing
investment has been a persistent drag on growth, while business investment has been more resilient
until recently, as past order backlogs supported the production of capital goods (Chart 20).

Our restrictive policy stance has transmitted at different speeds to different parts of the economy. The
speed and strength of transmission depends on several factors, including the importance of foreign
demand and foreign competition, the reliance on domestic compared to global supply chains, the


balance sheets of households and firms, the interest sensitivity of investment and consumption and
the state of the labour market. Estimates suggest that the peak impact of our policy tightening on
activity levels is larger for manufacturing than for services, with the peak impact occurring in the fourth
quarter of 2023, and larger for business and housing investment than for private consumption, with the
transmission to business investment strengthening further in the first quarter of 2024 (Chart 21 23)
As the structure of the euro area economy evolves, such sectoral heterogeneity in monetary policy
transmission may also alter the impact on aggregate economic activity. For instance, in view of the
rising role of services in the euro area, and the slower and weaker response of services output to
monetary policy, it is natural to ask whether transmission to the overall economy has become less
powerful in terms of its impact on output. ECB staff analysis confirms that a higher services intensity
dampens monetary policy transmission to economic activity, but this dampening effect is moderate: the
observed increase in the services share of the euro area economy since the launch of the euro is
estimated to have reduced the peak effect on output of a monetary policy interest rate increase by just
around 10 per cent (Chart 22),{41
Monetary policy tightening also has heterogeneous effects on different types of private consumption.
For example, our staff estimate that spending on durable goods and luxury goods declines more than it
does on non-durables, services, and necessity goods (Chart 23). Inflation is also found to adjust
differently across essential and non-essential items.

represented by the monetary policy shocks according to the high-frequency monetary policy shock series by
Jarocinski, M. and Karadi, P. (2020), “Deconstructing Monetary Policy Surprises — The role of Information

represent 95 per cent confidence bands. Non-durable goods also include semi-durable goods.
The build-up of household excess savings and the aggregate strength of corporate balance sheets
due to the restrictions on mobility and the significant fiscal transfers during the pandemic may have
helped to cushion the impact of monetary policy during the early phase of the tightening. The robust
labour market has also supported real income and consumption, in view of the sensitivity of household
spending plans to the perceived risk of unemployment. The rotation back towards services, particularly
contact-intensive and recreation and travel services following the post-pandemic reopening, was also
an important driver of the drop in the savings rate in 2022 and 2023.51
Nevertheless, the sharp increase in inflation has eroded the real value of household and corporate
deposits, while the jump in interest rates has generated losses on bond holdings and depressed house
prices, thus weighing on financial and non-financial wealth.“°] Moreover, household excess savings
accumulated over the pandemic are now concentrated mostly in illiquid assets held by wealthier
households, which may not provide a significant boost to private consumption.“ In addition, profit
margins and retained earnings have declined markedly since the start of the hiking cycle and the net
interest income earned by firms has fallen.11 Finally, while consumer confidence has recovered from
its extremely low levels in September 2022, which had been triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine


and surging energy prices, it is still low and well below its long-term average, weighing on spending
even as real disposable incomes grow (Chart 24), U2]

Notes: The latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2023 for private consumption and disposable income,
and April 2024 for consumer confidence.
As reflected in the March 2024 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, we expect
growth to recover gradually over the course of this year. Output in the euro area returned to a positive
growth rate in the first quarter of 2024 after five quarters of stagnation, while soft indicators, such as
the composite PMI for the euro area, point to further positive growth rates in the quarters ahead (Chart
25).
The recovery might continue to be characterised by different speeds across sectors. However, as the
impact of past monetary policy tightening starts reducing its intensity, the divergence between weak
manufacturing and resilient services activity should gradually reduce. The recovery should be
supported by declining inflation and further nominal wage growth, which boost real disposable incomes
and consumer confidence. A gradual pickup in foreign demand is also expected to support the
recovery. Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time. In line with this, the
March projections are also predicated on significant policy easing over the projection horizon (see also
Chart 1). Respondents in the most recent survey of monetary analysts (SMA) expect a gradual
recovery in GDP in the first half of this year, in line with the March projections, likely reflecting an
anticipation of an of an easing in financing conditions.

Transmission to inflation
We have already seen a substantial disinflation from the peak inflation rate of 10.6 per cent in October
2022 (Chart 26). Inflation had started to increase in early 2021 from the pandemic low point of -0.3 per
cent in late 2020, rising above the two per cent medium-term target in July 2021, before continuing to
climb throughout 2021 and most of 2022. Since late 2022, inflation has come down markedly and the
March 2024 ECB staff projections see inflation stabilising around the 2 per cent target from about the
middle of 2025 onwards.
In fact, inflation has declined more quickly than we had expected. For instance, inflation came in at 2.7
per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, 0.6 and 0.8
percentage points below what was projected back in September 2023, respectively. Slightly further
ahead, inflation is expected to continue to be close to our two per cent target. Inflation excluding
energy and food is projected to continue declining gradually over the projection horizon, also returning
to two per cent in the second half of 2025. Market participants largely agree with this assessment, with
the one-year forward inflation-linked swap (ILS) rate at around 2 per cent and the median respondent
in the SMA expecting inflation to stabilise at around 2 per cent in the second half of 2025.

observations for realised HICP and HICPX are for April 2024 (flash estimate); April 2024 round for SMA; March
projections cut-off for the inflation-linked forward swap rates (2 February 2024).
While overall, the strong disinflation over the past year largely reflects the unwinding in energy inflation
(which, in turn, partly reflects large base effects), the easing of pipeline pressures and the relaxation of
supply bottlenecks, monetary policy tightening has contributed to the disinflation process by
dampening demand and anchoring medium-term inflation expectations at our two per cent target.
Inflation has continued to fall in recent months. According to the recent flash release, headline inflation
remained stable in April at 2.4 per cent, while core inflation declined to 2.7 per cent from 2.9 per cent in
March. Both services and goods inflation declined in April, while energy and unprocessed food inflation
increased. Most measures of underlying inflation also continue to ease, although domestic price
pressures remain strong (Chart 27).

Wage growth is moderating but remains elevated, with recently signed agreements pointing to a
slowdown in wage growth to around 4 per cent for the remainder of the year (Chart 28). Firms are also
telling us that they expect to raise prices less, with the one year ahead selling price expectations now
hovering around 3 per cent, down from 6 per cent a year ago (Chart 29). They also expect slower
wage growth over the coming year. This is consistent with evidence from the European Commission,
which shows further declines in selling price expectations, which now stand around their mid-2021
levels for most sectors (Chart 30).

So, how has monetary policy contributed to the current disinflation? Monetary policy affects demand
and prices through various channels, some that are more direct (via intertemporal substitution) and
some that are more indirect (via growth and employment). This means that the full effect of changes in
monetary policy on aggregate inflation comes with long and variable lags. In the next section, | will
discuss some of the model-implied estimates of the impact that our policy tightening cycle has had on
inflation so far, and the expected impacts over the medium-term. However, granular price analysis can
also shed light on this question. As consumers rein in their spending in response to a monetary policy
tightening, they start by consuming fewer goods with a high intertemporal elasticity of substitution,
such as non-essential items and durables. They may also reduce spending on goods that are more
interest-rate sensitive, such as durable goods purchased using credit. Analysis by staff suggests that
the price response of items most sensitive to monetary policy shocks, which tend to include durables
and non-essential items, is around three times larger than for less sensitive items (Chart 31). Finally,
the price reaction to monetary policy shocks of these more sensitive consumer items has been
stronger in the recent tightening cycle than is past episodes of monetary restraint, reflecting the
effectiveness of the steep and decisive hiking policy in dampening demand.
Given the differential output impact of monetary policy across manufacturing and services that was
discussed in the previous section, we may also expect a differential impact on sectoral inflation.
Indeed, the share of items that are highly sensitive to monetary policy shocks is higher for goods than
for non-tradable services, while inflation reacts less to monetary policy shocks in countries that are
more intensive in services intermediates.22 For example, if prices in the traded sector (predominantly
capital intensive manufacturing) are largely exogenous and driven by world prices, then monetary
policy may have larger output effects but small price effects. The inverse may be true in the non-traded
sector (predominantly services where the prevalence of imperfect competition and price rigidities is
higher) where the combination of imperfect competition and price rigidities may give rise to stronger


price effects of monetary policy via the real economy. Pinning down these differences empirically can
be challenging in light of the diverse composition of these two sectors and confluence of other
(potentially countervailing) channels.

al. (2019), controlling for lags of the dependent variable, EuroStoxx index, industrial production, nominal effective
exchange rate, oil prices, producer prices, as well as three-month and one-year Euribor rates. Estimation samples
based on an expanding window approach are: (i) pre-COVID (December 2000-December 2019); (ii) including
COVID (December 2000 — December 2021); and (iii) including monetary policy normalisation and tightening
(December 2000 - September 2023). All impulse responses are normalised to 25 basis points increase in the
monetary policy proxy.
The next phase of the disinflation process is likely to be more gradual, with bumps in the road ahead.
We expect headline inflation to decline more slowly than it has done so far, largely on account of
positive base effects, including the expiration or retirement of fiscal measures taken in the past to
dampen the surge in energy prices for consumers and firms (Chart 32).

Akey role of monetary policy in the disinflation process has been to ensure that the large and
persistent but temporary inflation shocks did not translate into an increase in the medium-term inflation
trend through the de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Overall, longer-term inflation expectations
have remained well anchored throughout the tightening cycle. The anchoring of longer-term
expectations and the expectation that inflation would return to target in a timely manner has been
supported by the speed and magnitude of the monetary policy response.
The expectations curve from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) has remained downward
sloping throughout the inflation surge (which was also the case for consumers), meaning that the spike
in inflation was not expected to persist and long-term expectations remained broadly stable (Chart 33).
The right tail in the distribution of long-term inflation expectations in the SPF has diminished markedly
compared with the peak inflation phase in late 2022 (Chart 34). The inflation risk premium embedded
in five-year-on-five-year inflation swaps has declined by about 40 basis points since last summer
(Chart 35). We have also seen a decline in the inflation expectations at the medium-term horizon
reported by firms and households from both the SAFE and CES results (Chart 36).

Counterfactual analysis
In this section, | report on some counterfactual model-based exercises conducted by ECB staff.
In providing a complete account of the role of monetary policy, it is simply not feasible in empirical
studies to have full control over various confounding factors that contribute to output and inflation
dynamics. Accordingly, one role for counterfactual analysis is to isolate the contribution of monetary


policy tightening in the disinflation process. Estimates from our suite of macro models suggest that the
monetary policy tightening that has cumulated since 2022 and is expected to continue to transmit
through 2026 is detracting, on average, around 2 percentage points yearly from both GDP growth and
inflation, relative to the counterfactual simulated path in the absence of policy action (Chart 37)./24)
In addition, these simulations suggest that, while the impact on GDP growth from our cumulative action
might have reached its maximum level in 2023, the bulk of the impact on inflation is comparatively
backloaded, with substantial pass-through still expected to transpire in the period ahead. In this
quantitative model-based analysis, the calculation of the monetary policy impact abstracts from the
role that the strong policy response to the surge in inflation has had in ensuring that inflation
expectations have remained broadly anchored. That is, the policy impact would be even stronger if the
models also assigned a role for monetary policy in maintaining the anchor.

Notes: This chart reports the results of a simulation involving changes to short-term rate expectations between

October 2021 (to account for anticipation) and May 2023. The reported values refer to year-on-year growth rates.

Chart 38 illustrates a model-based exercise on the development of upside de-anchoring risks under
the actual interest path during the hiking phase (blue bars) and a counterfactual analysis where the
rate is assumed to have remained on the path underlying the December 2021 projections (yellow
bars). De-anchoring is defined as a situation where medium-term inflation expectations deviate from
the ECB’s 2 per cent inflation target. The analysis of the risks of de-anchoring are based on stochastic
simulations around the projections of a regime-switching dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
(DSGE) model. In the anchored regime, the perceived inflation target is in line with the actual 2 per
cent target. In contrast, in the de-anchored regime, inflation expectations are driven by past and


current inflation realisations, even though the central bank continues to pursue the unchanged 2 per
cent target.
Chart 38 shows that, due to the tightening of monetary policy, the credibility of the central bank has
been maintained by containing upside de-anchoring risks. If rates had been kept at the level of
December 2021, the risks would have increased considerably.

Notes: The bars show the risks of upside de-anchoring for the December 2023 projections and a ‘no-
normalisation’ counterfactual where the rate expectations remain on the path underlying the December 2021
projections. 2024, 2025 and 2026 refer to the projections according to the December 2023 projections. The
simulations are based on a regime switching version of the NAWM | Christoffel, K.. Coenen, G. and Warne, A.
(2007)), where the credible regime is defined as the estimated version of the NAWN-I, with a fixed inflation target,
the de-anchored regime is characterised by a time varying inflation target. Upward de-anchoring is defined as a
situation where the de-anchored simulation path is above the baseline inflation path. The share of de-anchoring is
based on 1000 simulations over a nine-quarter evaluation horizon.
Asecond role for counterfactual analysis is to probe whether alternative tightening paths might have
out-performed the tightening path we adopted. Chart 39 reports a set of alternative policy simulations,
based on two macroeconomic models of the euro area (the MMR model and the NAWM-II model),
which allow the derivation of policy rate paths that are conditionally optimal in the context of the
models, given the different information sets available to policy makers regarding the path for inflation
and the output gap at different points in time.241
The models suggest that, if the ECB had perfect foresight on the path that inflation and output would
follow subsequently, we should have started hiking in the fourth quarter of 2021, raising the policy rate
to between 4.5 and 6 per cent by mid-2023, depending on the model used (black dotted lines in Chart
39). Under this earlier and more aggressive tightening path, inflation would have peaked at around 7
per cent, roughly 3% percentage points below the actual inflation peak in October 2022.


However, the associated output losses would have been severe. This result derives from the fact that
the model attributes welfare losses to (squared) deviations of inflation from the target, output from
potential, as well as interest rates from the equilibrium value. In that context, to some extent, the model
finds it optimal to tolerate a large recession to reduce peak inflation. Along this line, the MMR model
estimates that, to achieve this lower inflation profile, output would have needed to decline by 5 per
cent below the baseline by the end of 2022, while the NAWM-II model shows that the economy would
have needed to contract by 2 per cent in early 2022 and continue contracting for over a year.
Of course, the ECB did not have perfect foresight as to the future path of inflation and output: there
were large forecast errors in 2021 and especially 2022, with a prominent role for the unexpected surge
in energy prices and, relatedly, food prices. 23] Chart 39 also shows the updates to the model-based
optimal policy paths that were triggered by the updates to the macroeconomic projections between
December 2021 and December 2023, illustrating the high sensitivity of these paths to revised beliefs
about the projected paths for inflation and output. In very broad terms, the revisions to the policy path
followed by the ECB have been directionally similar to the revisions to such optimal policy paths.

Notes: The optimal policy rate path simulations beyond the first quarter of 2024 are not shown for confidentiality
reasons. “Actual” denotes historical data (DFR for the MMR model and €STR for the NAWM Il). The other dashed
lines on the left graph are a sequence of optimal policy counterfactuals computed in real time at each projection
vintage from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2023. The “With hindsight” lines denote the optimal
policy counterfactual computed in the fourth quarter of 2021 with the benefit of hindsight by assuming that the
same information that we now have on subsequent inflation and output developments and projections in the
March 2024 ECB projections was already available in the fourth quarter of 2021. The middle and right panels
show implied inflation and output gap respectively. For MMR: The output gap is in deviation from baseline output
gap in the relevant vintage. For NAWM: The figure depicts the optimal policy counterfactuals carried out using the
New Area Wide Model (NAWM) II (see Darracg Pariés, M., Kornprobst, A., and Priftis, R (2024)) at different points
in time conditional on quarterly real-time macroeconomic projection baselines of the ECB between the fourth
quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2023.
It is also useful to expand the counterfactual analysis to take into account that the run-down of our
securities portfolio has contributed to bringing inflation back to target. Optimal policy rate simulations in
the MMR model show that our decisions regarding the securities portfolios and the associated change


in expectations since the start of policy normalisation have been equivalent to an average of 30 basis
points in rate increases between the first quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2026.24] A similar
analysis using the NAWM II model suggests that, compared to the case where the short-term interest
rate is the sole policy instrument, an optimal policy mix, which considers changes to both the interest
rate and the central bank balance sheet starting in the third quarter of Q3 2022, would have called for
an unwinding of the central bank balance sheet by an additional 4 percentage points of GDP by the
end of 2027, compared with expectations for the balance sheet path at the time, and a policy rate that
is lower by around 10 basis points throughout the simulation horizon.!25! This optimal combination of
policy instruments would have contributed towards marginally lower inflation and higher output,
compared with the case where the short-term rate is the only available instrument.
A third role for counterfactual analysis is to examine the implications of uncertainty (as captured by
alternative scenarios) for the conduct of monetary policy. In particular, since multiple dimensions of
uncertainty are relevant, it is desirable to probe the robustness of monetary policy across a range of
scenarios. For instance, taken in isolation, uncertainty about the persistence of inflation (for example,
think of a scenario in which the feedback of wage inflation to price inflation could be stronger than
expected) would call fora more aggressive monetary policy response to above-target inflation.
However, also taken in isolation, uncertainty about the strength of monetary policy transmission would
call for a more attenuated monetary policy response.
In order to think about the performance of a given monetary policy option across these different
scenarios, it is useful to inspect model-based robustness exercises. Such counterfactual robustness
exercises are routinely carried out by staff at the ECB. For instance, it is helpful to view the calculation
of a “minimise maximum regret” criterion that minimises the worst-case welfare loss across various
scenarios, with staff running simulations on the basis of a range of possible model-based loss
functions that attaches weights to deviations of inflation from the target and deviations of output from
potential output. When inflation is projected in the baseline to be not too far above the target, it turns
out that “inflation persistence uncertainty” dominates only if the loss function puts zero weight on
output losses, whereas “monetary transmission uncertainty” dominates if the loss function puts some
weight on output losses. This is because the output losses under a more aggressive monetary policy
response, if transmission turns out to be stronger and inflation declines more quickly than expected,
outweigh the losses under a more attenuated monetary policy response if inflation turns out to be more
persistent.29
Another type of robustness exercise is to examine the conduct of monetary policy under alternative
modelling assumptions. For instance, as indicated earlier, it is evident that the large shocks in 2021
and especially 2022 triggered an increase in the frequency of price adjustment. Current work in
progress by a team of economists from different central banks develop an optimal policy analysis that
allows for a shift toward more frequent price changes in response to large shocks.24 Under their
approach, an increase in the frequency of price changes represents both an extra cost from high
inflation (since there are economic costs — including management costs — from adjusting prices more
frequently) but also an opportunity: if price setters understand that the central bank is committed to
returning inflation to the target in a timely manner through an aggressive interest rate response to the


large shock, the phase of intense inflation will be shorter and the sacrifice ratio in terms of lost output
will be lower since price setters only have to focus on adjusting prices to the cost shock rather than
also having to incorporate an excessively-prolonged aftershock phase of second round effects. In turn,
the anticipation of the monetary policy response helps to reduce the scale and duration of inflation
response to the large shock.
Of course, while such model-based, staff-led robustness simulations help to provide some analytical
underpinnings in reviewing policy options, many factors feed into the overall risk assessment of
policymakers in making a rate decision. During the tightening cycle, the hierarchy of the various
dimensions of uncertainty has shifted across different phases.
For instance, in the first half of 2022, uncertainty about the impact of the sharp shift in the expected
path for the balance sheet with the end of net asset purchases (from a scale above €1 trillion in 2021)
motivated a step-by-step approach to the phasing-out of quantitative easing, especially in the context
of a similar shift by other central banks. The high economic damage envisaged in the alternative
scenarios considered in March 2022 in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also
motivated a gradual approach to the initial adjustment in the monetary stance in the first half of 2022.
For instance, the optimal policy simulations in the MMR and NAWM-II models for the adverse
downside scenario based on the escalation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine published with the March
2022 projections prescribed a less responsive policy path compared to the baseline. /24l
By the same token, the very sharp rise in actual and projected inflation in the course of 2022 puta
premium on guarding against the de-anchoring of inflation expectations and motivated an accelerated
approach to monetary tightening between July 2022 and March 2023, with the policy rate being raised
by 350 basis points over six meetings. This acceleration took place in the context of a considerable
decline in transmission tail risks in view of the observed smoothness of the exit from quantitative
easing and the reassurance provided by the announcement of the Transmission Protection Instrument
(TPI) in July 2022.
The March 2023 meeting also signalled a shift to a more granular approach to calibrating the level of
restrictiveness, with the four subsequent meetings moving rates up in 25 basis point increments.
Moving to a lower incremental pace reflected the reduction in inflation uncertainty (inflation had
declined markedly from the October 2022 peak) and the increase in uncertainty about monetary policy
transmission in view of the mounting evidence of a sharp slowdown in credit dynamics and in
recognition of the time lags before the full impact of the accumulated hikes could be observed.
The final hike at the September 2023 meeting also incorporated risk management considerations. In
particular, in view of some signs of an increase in inflation risks over the course of the summer, it was
judged to be safer to increase the policy rate by a further 25 basis points to 4.0 per cent. This
additional hike would reinforce progress towards the target for two basic reasons. First, if the economy
evolved in line with the staff baseline case, the decision to hike would bolster confidence that inflation
would return to target within the projection horizon. Second, a higher interest rate would more strongly
limit the amplification of any upside shocks to the inflation path. In consequence, a more secure pace
of disinflation and greater insurance against upside risks would also reinforce the anchoring of inflation
expectations, which remained a precondition for the disinflation process to keep up its pace.


The next phase: reducing the level of restriction
In line with our assessment at the April monetary policy meeting, this review of the tightening cycle,
together with the observed disinflation path in recent months and the analysis of the drivers of inflation
over the projection horizon, indicates that, based on the three elements of our reaction function we can
conclude that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the
ongoing disinflation process. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently
restrictive for as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our
confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to
reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction.
Subject to maintaining sufficient confidence in the sustained convergence of inflation to our target, the
appropriate speed and scale of the reduction in the level of restriction will need to take into account
several factors.24 First, given the lags in transmission, the tightening effects from our past interest
rate hikes are still unfolding. The simulations shown in Chart 37 suggest that, while the impact on GDP
growth from our cumulative action might have reached its maximum level in 2023, the bulk of the
impact on inflation is comparatively backloaded, with substantial pass-through still expected to
transpire in the period ahead.
Second, as we continue along the disinflation path, the evolution of inflation expectations also has
implications for the calibration of monetary policy restriction. As expectations of future inflation
normalise further, leaving nominal rates unchanged implies a mechanical increase in real interest
rates. For instance, if it were deemed appropriate to keep interest rates stable in real terms, nominal
rates would need to decline in line with inflation expectations. In turn, this would reinforce the
normalisation of inflation expectations and help to keep longer-term expectations of inflation well
anchored at target.
Third, there are two-sided risks in proceeding through the next phase. In one direction, easing policy
too soon or proceeding too quickly would not be consistent with inflation sustainably returning to target
if inflation turns out to be more persistent than anticipated. In the other direction, keeping rates overly
restrictive for too long could push inflation below target over the medium term and incur excessive side
effects in terms of sacrificed output, employment and investment. This would require corrective action
through a subsequent acceleration in rate cuts that could even require having to descend to below-
neutral levels to fix any persistent drift towards a below-target inflation trend.
In navigating these risks, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting
approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-
committing to a particular rate path. This approach has served us well in the tightening cycle and many
of the same considerations will apply during the unwinding phase. In particular, we will have to balance
the merits of forecast-based criteria that might call for front-loaded rate cuts versus data-dependent
criteria that might call for a gradual and sequential approach, in view of the remaining uncertainty
around the degree of persistence in inflation dynamics. Since the relative strengths of these opposing
considerations are continuously evolving, a meeting-by-meeting approach maximises policy optionality.


A data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach is the best way to ensure that the calibration of
monetary policy incorporates the multiple dimensions of uncertainty that have been highlighted in this
lecture. Each quarterly projection meeting provides comprehensive staff updates on the inflation
outlook, underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission. In turn, while the staff
projections are based on the market yield curve, the information at the quarterly meetings provides the
foundations for an array of simulations of possible future rate paths, including optimal policy exercises
as shown in Chart 39 and “robust” paths that seek to minimise the risk of a policy error across a range
of plausible scenarios.
While this family of possible future rate paths provides helpful guidance to the Governing Council, the
robust approach to making rate decisions under conditions of high uncertainty is to avoid pre-
commitments or creating unwarranted expectations about the future rate path. In particular, moving
from one meeting to the next meeting and from one projection round to the next projection round
allows for the accumulation of further data that can help inform the rate decision.
For instance, the net interpretation of the incoming data at a non-projection meeting can result in
several possible outcomes: (i) the confirmation of the quarterly assessment; (ii) a further boost to the
level of confidence in the sustainability of convergence to the target and/or increased evidence of
adverse economic side effects from the level of restriction; (iii) a decline in the level of confidence in
the sustainability of convergence to the target and/or increased evidence of economic resilience
despite the level of restriction. These outcomes differ markedly in terms of the implications for a rate
decision at a non-projection meeting. Accordingly, it is best not to commit to a pre-set path for rate
decisions and preserve optionality.
Conclusion
To conclude, the tightening cycle has ensured that the disinflation process has not been derailed by
the de-anchoring of inflation expectations, with the sustainable return of inflation to our target
underpinned by a dampened-demand environment. We consider that the key ECB interest rates are at
levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process. Our future
decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. If our
updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of
monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our
target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy
restriction. In any event, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting
approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-
committing to a particular rate path.

Variation across the euro area in the importance of fixed-rate mortgages was identified since the
beginning of the euro as a source of transmission heterogeneity, as emphasised by Dornbusch, R., C.
Favero and F. Giavazzi (1998) “Immediate Challenges for the European Central Bank,” Economic
Policy 13(26), 15-64. In addition to this cross-country variation, there was a trend increase in the share
of fixed-rate mortgages during the pre-pandemic low interest rate period. While fixed-rate mortgages
transfer the interest rate exposure away from the mortgage borrower to the holders of interest-
sensitive assets, it is plausible that the mortgage borrowers have higher marginal propensities to
consume.

While | focus on banks in this lecture, clearly non-bank financial intermediation also plays a role in the
transmission of monetary policy. Since 2009, the importance of banks in euro area financial
intermediation has declined in favour of non-bank financial institutions (NBFls). Direct lending by
NBFIs to the private sector is relatively small in the broad euro area, with notable exceptions
concentrated in few countries. But those institutions play a dominant role in holding both sovereign and


corporate bonds and their balance sheet has steadily increased since the global financial crisis.
Hence, since the global financial crisis, the reduction in the relative role of loans over bonds has
translated into a diminished importance of banks in monetary transmission compared with NBFIs.
Recent research demonstrates that monetary policy transmission via traditional banks and NBFlIs
differs in non-trivial ways but remains effective in the face of a changing monetary toolkit and evolving
central bank mandate. See for instance Gebauer, S. and Mazelis, F. (2023), “Macroprudential
regulation and leakage to the shadow banking sector’, European Economic Review, Vol. 154, No

inflation rates to monetary policy may also depend on differential exposure to international competition.
For example, if prices in the traded sector (predominantly capital- intensive manufacturing) are largely
exogenous and driven by world prices, then monetary policy may have large output effects but small
price effects. The inverse may be true in the non-traded sector (predominantly services where
domestic demand plays a larger role in determining prices).

The simulations are carried out using the NAWM II model. See Coenen, G., Karadi, P., Schmidt, S.

model for forecasting and policy analysis with a financial sector’, Working Paper Series, No 2200,

and D. Sandri, 2023, “The contribution of monetary policy to disinflation,” BIS Bulletin No. 82. Of
course, many alternative counterfactual exercises are possible and many alternative calibration
choices can be implemented, such that the reported exercises are illustrative in nature.

For further details on the policy counterfactuals carried out using the Mazelis, Motto and Ristiniemi
(MMR) model, see Mazelis, F., Motto, R. and Ristiniemi, A. (2023), op. cit. are prepared for a chapter in
the forthcoming Handbook on Inflation (Coenen, Mazelis, Motto, Ristiniemi, Smets, Wouters
(forthcoming)). For further details on the policy counterfactuals carried out using the New Area-Wide
Model (NAWM) II, see Darracg Pariés, M., Kornprobst, A. and Priftis, R. (2024), “Monetary policy
strategies to navigate post-pandemic inflation: an assessment using the ECB’s New Area-Wide
Model’, Working Paper Series, No 2935, ECB, April. The optimal policy simulations in both models are
conducted in the COPPs toolkit. For further details see de Groot, O., Mazelis, F., Motto, R. and

This finding is based on an ex-post analysis using optimal policy counterfactuals under two different
sets of assumptions. In a first exercise, the policymaker is assumed to be aware of realised
macroeconomic developments and forecasts as captured by the ECB projections from March 2024,
but is able to implement an alternative rate path already from the start of the policy normalisation in
2021Q4. The rate path follows optimal policy based on a loss function that takes the following
variables into account: deviations of inflation from the target; the output gap; interest rate smoothing.
The relative weights on these variables are estimated using euro area data. In a second exercise,
optimal rate policy is conducted under the counterfactual assumption that the securities portfolios
evolved according to expectations prior to the announcement of policy normalisation at the December
2021 GovC rather than according to their actual evolution. Due to the higher balance sheet and
associated macroeconomic dynamics, the optimal rate path in the second exercise is 30bps higher on
average over the period 2022Q1 to 202604.


25.
Optimal policy counterfactuals under commitment in 2022Q3 are computed conditional on the
December 2023 macroeconomic baseline and a central bank loss function, which beyond penalising
deviations of inflation from target and deviations of GDP from potential, it also includes penalties on
asset holding and interest rate and balance sheet volatility. The penalties of the loss function are
calibrated such that under optimal balance sheet policies in March 2015, the path produced by the
model is consistent with announcements on asset purchases by the Governing Council as of March
2015.

These robust control exercises use three models: MMR model (Mazelis, Motto, Ristiniemi, 2023), the
New Area-Wide Model (Coenen, Karadi, Schmidt, Warne, 2019), and the BASE model (Angelini,
Bokan, Christoffel, Ciccarelli, Zimic, 2019). A weight of 0.25 on the output gap follows the literature
(Kiley and Roberts, 2017) and practice in other policy institutions (Yellen, 2012). These values are
consistent with a relative weight on unemployment rate deviations from its natural rate of 1 (Svensson
and Tetlow, 2015; Debortoli et al., 2019) and an Okun’s law coefficient of 0.5 that relates the output
gap to the unemployment gap. The robust control approach avoids the policy paths that would deliver
the largest losses.
