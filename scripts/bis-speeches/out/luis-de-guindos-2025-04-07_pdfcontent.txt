1/3 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Luis de Guindos: Financial stability in uncertain times
Speech by Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the 
International Federation of Accountants' Chief Executives Forum, Amsterdam, 3 April 
2025.

Introduction
It is a pleasure to be taking part in the International Federation of Accountants' Chief 
Executives Forum today.In line with the topic of the event, I will reflect on the risks and 1 
uncertainty that threaten financial stability and their implications for policymakers. I will 
be brief to allow enough time to take your questions.
Conceptually, risk is associated with situations where the exact outcome is unknown 
but the possible outcomes can be identified and their probabilities can be estimated 
reasonably well.For the ECB, financial stability is defined as a condition in which the 2 
financial system is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of financial 
imbalances. So, when assessing financial stability, we evaluate the likelihood of shocks 
materialising and their potential impact. Uncertainty, by contrast, refers to scenarios 
where it is impossible to define and measure outcomes and probabilities, often owing to 
a lack of information. While risk is quantifiable, uncertainty can be proxied at best.
The current environment
Uncertainty in the macro-financial and credit environment is currently exceptionally 
high, in a world being reshaped by significant shifts in geopolitics, international 
cooperation, global trade policy, financial regulation and the role of crypto-assets. At the 
same time, the scale of the defence investment foreseen in the EU is unprecedented 
and adds another significant layer of uncertainty to the current environment.
According to a news-based index, economic policy uncertainty in the euro area is 3
currently more than three times the historical average.Similarly, an index of trade 4 
policy uncertainty is more than eight times the historical average.These levels are well 5 
above those seen during the pandemic.
Amid all of this uncertainty, the ECB's Governing Council decided to lower interest rates 
by another 25 basis points in March. The deposit facility rate is now at 2.5%, 150 basis 
points below its recent peak.
The disinflation process is well on track, with inflation developing broadly as expected. 
Headline inflation decreased further from 2.3% in February to 2.2% in March. According 
to recent data and in line with our projections, wage growth is moderating, which is 
helping services inflation to gradually decline. Most measures of underlying inflation 
suggest that inflation will settle at around our 2% inflation target, on a sustained basis.

But uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook remains high, mainly on account of 
increasing friction in global trade. An escalation in trade tensions could see the euro 
depreciate and import costs rise, while much needed defence and infrastructure 
spending could raise inflation via aggregate demand. Geopolitical tensions could also 
lead to higher inflation owing to trade disruptions, rising commodity prices and energy 
costs. At the same time, lower demand for euro area exports and lower growth resulting 
from the impact of higher tariffs or geopolitical tensions could pose a threat to the 
economy, depress demand and push inflation down.
Weak economic growth remains a challenge for the euro area, even without any further 
shocks. ECB staff have again revised down their growth projections – to 0.9% for 2025, 
1.2% for 2026 and 1.3% for 2027. The downward revisions reflect lower exports and 
ongoing weakness in investment. High uncertainty, both at home and abroad, is holding 
back investment, while competitiveness challenges are weighing on exports. 
Addressing these challenges in order to improve growth prospects is clearly more 
demanding in the current context of exceptionally high uncertainty about trade and 
economic policy.
Challenges when analysing financial stability
Our macroeconomic projections are not the only area where we face great difficulties 
navigating this environment of heightened uncertainty. Analysing financial stability also 
requires us to adjust our frameworks and use state-of-the-art tools to assess the 
financial system's capacity to withstand shocks under these conditions.
Analysing multiple scenarios is a powerful way to deal with situations of high 
uncertainty. It allows us to test the resilience of the financial system against various 
possible manifestations of financial stress. Shocks cannot be predicted, but drawing on 
a diverse array of indicators and a range of sensitivity analyses is essential for us to 
understand the nuances of the current uncertainty. It is also crucial that our various 
approaches include ways to measure sources of risk amplification and non-linearities. 
By combining hard data indicators with survey results and analyses based on micro 
data, we can achieve a more granular, diverse and timely understanding of the 
economic landscape. Such a comprehensive approach can enhance our ability to 
anticipate and respond to emerging challenges.
The main risks to financial stability in the euro area
In the current economic environment, we are observing marked vulnerabilities in 
financial stability. While banks remain in good shape, with sound solvency and liquidity 
indicators that are well above regulatory minimums, there are weaknesses in several 
other areas. First, elevated valuations and concentrated risks make financial markets 
susceptible to adverse corrections. Non-bank financial intermediaries have remained 
resilient to recent bouts of market volatility, but they are still quite heavily exposed to 
risky assets. Broader market shocks could cause sudden investment fund outflows or 
trigger margin calls on derivative exposures, unsettling markets and leading to abrupt 
price corrections. Second, sovereign indebtedness is a cause for concern at a time 
when defence spending is emerging as a priority in Europe, with different countries 
having very different amounts of fiscal space to respond. Despite the likely increase in

debt servicing costs, public finances need to be managed in a growth-friendly way and 
ultimately be sustainable. Third, the corporate sector has demonstrated resilience but 
faces competitiveness challenges and is subject to emerging credit risk concerns, 
especially in the case of firms that are more exposed to the export sector and 
geopolitical risks.
Conclusion
In conclusion, an extraordinarily high level of uncertainty around economic and trade 
policy has been acting as a drag on markets and the economy alike. Financial 
intermediaries need to adapt their risk management tools in the face of new 
vulnerabilities and scenarios at a time when it is no longer possible to measure likely 
outcomes and probabilities. This environment calls for heightened vigilance, which is 
why we are exploring unconventional sources of risk and vulnerability and using a 
broader range of tools, such as sensitivity and scenario analyses, to assess the 
resilience of the financial system.
In terms of monetary policy, this uncertainty means we need to be extremely prudent 
when determining the appropriate stance. While most indicators point to inflation 
moving in the right direction, the environment of exceptional uncertainty requires us to 
stick even more closely to our data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach.
The European Union is at a crossroads. Defence policy requires a significant overhaul 
and challenges relating to trade and economic competitiveness need to be addressed. 
In addition to ramping up defence spending, we need to deepen and strengthen our 
Economic and Monetary Union with a true single market for goods and services that 
shores up our structural economic growth prospects, supported by a complete banking 
union and capital markets union.
