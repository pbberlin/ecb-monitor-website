Dear President of the European Central Bank Christine Lagarde, Dear Member of the 
European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis, Governors, Ambassadors, Esteemed 
Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my great honour and pleasure to welcome you to this historic venue. We are at the 
Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. Since the early days of the Grand Dutchy, a 
predecessor of modern Lithuania, the Palace has stood as a geopolitical and economic 
centre.
The occasion that gathers us today is very special. 10 years ago, Lithuania joined the 
euro. Which is also both an economic and geopolitical landmark.
Therefore, the topic of today's conference – Pillars of Resilience Amid Global 
Geopolitical Shifts – is not accidental. It is an invitation to reflect on the most pressing 
challenges to Lithuanian and European economies. And, most importantly, how we can 
overcome them.
The Euro Area accession does not happen overnight. Or, as Lithuania's experience 
proves, by trying once. Economic and legal criteria are rigorous, making the accession 
a demanding journey.
During this journey, both actions and words matter. I would like to extend my sincere 
gratitude to you, Christine. For your support and consistent vision on the euro area 
membership, when you visited Lithuania in 2013. Back then, in your capacity as the 
Managing Director of the IMF.
Dear Christine, Merci Cordialement!
Besides being demanding, Lithuania's journey was also collective. The adoption of the 
common currency is beyond the capacity of a single institution. I would like to express 
my gratitude to everyone. Your bright minds and strong will made it possible.

Thank you!
And, congratulations to all Lithuanian people and all of us here on this 10 year jubilee!
I see the euro membership as one of the cornerstones. A part of Lithuania's strategic 
and decisive Euro-Atlantic integration since the 90s.
Lithuania is an old European country. Whose name was first officially mentioned more 
than a thousand years ago. Despite a relatively early appearance on the European 
map, Lithuania's political and economic development has not been continuous. And of 
the past 200 years, our country was independent and sovereign for less than 60.
Accession to the European Union, NATO, Schengen Area are landmark events. They 
show that solidifying and deepening Lithuania's ties with the Euro-Atlantic friends has 
been consistent. The accession to the euro area was part of our steady goal to increase 
economic and geopolitical resilience.
Esteemed guests,
The euro was one of the best economic decisions over the last 30 years. It has brought 
tangible economic benefits to the people.  
10 years ago, on the euro doorstep, Lithuania's economy had to be and was well 
balanced.
And the euro now further strengthens us. The euro contributed to the trade expansion. 
Financial stability was enhanced by eliminating currency mismatches and broadening 
liquidity management tools.
The euro reduces downside risks to our economy. That is most evident in crisis 
situations.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, despite a complete shutdown of economic activity and 
huge uncertainty about the future, international capital markets were lending to 
Lithuania at low interest rates.
This not only helped to prevent an economic contraction it also stands in stark contrast 
to GDP loss that we experienced at the depth of the global financial crisis.
Lithuania strengthened its geopolitical resilience and economic stability with the 
adoption of euro.
By introducing the euro, Lithuania demonstrated that the European project is attractive. 
And its objectives of economic stability and geopolitical cohesion continue to hold 
appeal.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The ten-year anniversary of the euro in Lithuania offers a chance to look into the future. 
And to steer it by making wishes. So, what do I wish for our common currency?

Jean Monnet said "Continue, continue, there is no future for the people of Europe other 
than in Union. "
I would add that our single currency would indefinitely continue providing benefit for the 
people. And here, in Lithuania, we are on a good trajectory.
My second wish is that we not only continue to stay together but also further deepen 
our integration: improving our single market modus operandi, increasing growth and 
productivity, and enhancing institutional capabilities. These are not just economic 
matters. Certainly, not in the context of russia's unjustified invasion of Ukraine.
I am sure that today we will have a lot to say about these and other Pillars of Resilience.
I stop here and, once again, congratulate all of us on the 10th anniversary of the euro in 
Lithuania. 
Thank you!
