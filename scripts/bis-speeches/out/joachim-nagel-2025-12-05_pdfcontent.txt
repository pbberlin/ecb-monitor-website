For example, both are export‑driven, with large manufacturing bases.
Manufacturing made up about 18 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) in
Germany, and a striking 24 per cent in the Republic of Korea in 2023 – far more
than the 13 per cent across the
OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).  As a result,
both economies are deeply embedded in global value chains. This means that
they are exposed to trade policy changes and geopolitical risks, especially
involving the United States and China. 
Furthermore, both countries depend heavily on imported energy, making them
vulnerable to global energy price shocks. In 2023, Germany met around 70 per
cent of its energy needs through net imports. In the Republic of Korea, the share
was even higher at 85 per cent.
Finally, both Germany and the Republic of Korea have a rapidly ageing popula‐
tion and low birth rates. The fertility rate was about 1.4 in Germany and 0.7 in
the Republic of Korea in 2023.   Both rates are below 2.1, which is the level
required to keep the population stable. This demographic shift will weigh on
labour supply and public ﬁnances.
In this speech, I will set out how we can address these challenges and seize the
opportunities that come along with them. As you would expect, my focus is on
Germany and Europe. Yet some of the lessons might be relevant to the Republic
of Korea as well. I will organise my speech around three questions:
First, what is the current economic situation in Germany and what is the
medium-term outlook?
Second, what policy measures could Germany enact at the national level to
address the challenges ahead?
Third, what needs to be done at the European level to complement these
national reforms?
I will close with a discussion on the outlook for euro area monetary policy.

2 Current economic situation in Germany
Let me start with Germany’s economic backdrop. In the 2010s, Germany enjoyed
solid growth, powered by earlier structural reforms and strong global demand.
As late as 2017, Germany was still growing faster than the euro area as a whole.
But towards the end of the twenty-tens, the German growth engine began to
stutter.
One key reason was a loss of competitiveness for German ﬁrms in several inter‐
national markets. According to recent Bundesbank estimates, this loss of com‐
petitiveness accounts for around three-quarters of the decline in export market
shares observed in recent years. 
Furthermore, many German ﬁrms specialise in products that have been aﬀected
by subdued global demand, such as cars. As a consequence, Germany’s export
goods mix – which, for decades, was a recipe for success – has also contributed
to recent market share losses.
On top of these structural headwinds, a series of shocks has dampened eco‐
nomic growth. Germany’s deep integration within global supply chains meant
that the pandemic hit hard. Logistics bottlenecks and shortages of intermediate
inputs aﬀected more ﬁrms than in many other countries. 
Furthermore, Germany’s heavy reliance on Russian gas ampliﬁed the energy
price surge after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That shock is still felt across
energy-intensive industries. 
Against this backdrop, what is the outlook for the German economy? The latest
Bundesbank forecast from June sees two opposing forces shaping 2025 and the
following two years:
On the one hand, US (United States) tariﬀs and policy uncertainty will weigh on
growth this year and next.  Recent US (United States) trade measures have
pushed up average US (United States)-tariﬀs on EU (European Union) goods
from around 1.5 per cent to about 15 per cent.
[4]
[5]

On the other hand, expansionary ﬁscal policy will help to drive a recovery from
next year onwards. Higher defence and infrastructure spending will boost
demand. This could support GDP (gross domestic product) growth by roughly
three‑quarters of a percentage point in cumulative terms over the next two
years.
However, on its own, higher public spending will not change our long‑term
growth path. Our internal Bundesbank simulations show that the extra ﬁscal
spending would only modestly raise potential output. To exploit the full potential
of the ﬁscal package, it must be complemented by structural reforms.
3 Structural challenges for Germany
What might those reforms look like? I will focus on three main areas that could
boost our growth potential: a better business environment, a more eﬃcient
energy system and higher labour supply.
3.1 Business environment
The ﬁrst area that has to improve in Germany is the business environment. 
To regain market shares in a turbulent global trading environment, ﬁrms need
scope to invest and innovate. Bureaucracy is the most‑cited investment con‐
straint in recent surveys.  Compliance costs have risen – especially for manufac‐
turing ﬁrms. Let me illustrate this using two numbers. 
According to the ifo (economic research institution) Institute, excessive bureau‐
cracy costs nearly €150 billion in output each year – more than 3 per cent of
GDP (gross domestic product).  The Institute for Employment Research found
that ﬁrms hired around 325,000 extra staﬀ in recent years just to comply with
new rules.  That is scarce labour tied up in non‑productive tasks.
But bureaucracy not only costs money and ties up scarce labour. It also stiﬂes
start‑ups: bureaucratic hurdles and delays were the most frequently-cited barri‐
ers to starting a business.  Accordingly, Germany should urgently cut unneces‐
sary red tape. 
3.2 Energy markets
The second area in need of reforms is the energy sector.

[9]

High energy prices have hit German industry hard. At the same time, Germany
has legally committed itself to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. This trans‐
ition will require substantial investment.
According to estimates in a recent study, Germany has to invest around
€390 billion annually from 2021 to 2030, or 11 percent of its
GDP (gross domestic product).  However, in many cases, these investments are
typical replacement investments, as fossil-fuel-based technologies are simply
being phased out in favour of climate-neutral alternatives. The additional net ﬁn‐
ancing needs are thus much lower, amounting to around €120 billion or some
three per cent of GDP (gross domestic product).
Our goal should be to deliver the transition at the lowest possible cost. A single,
standard carbon price across sectors is the most eﬃcient way to cut emissions.
This directs eﬀorts to areas where cuts are most cost-eﬀective and spurs innova‐
tion in green technologies. To avoid distorting price signals, subsidies for activit‐
ies that are harmful to the climate should be phased out.
Policy must also provide reliability, because the transition needs long‑term
investment. In addition, we must accelerate digitalisation in the energy system.
By rapidly rolling out smart meters, smart grids and enabling bidirectional char‐
ging, we could make more eﬃcient use of renewables. This could signiﬁcantly
reduce the costs of the green transition.
All in all, I am convinced that keeping up the pace of renewables deployment will
ultimately pay oﬀ. This is our best route to cutting our dependence on imports
and staying on the path to climate neutrality.
3.3 Labour supply
The third area in need of reforms is labour supply. 
The demographic trend is the main headwind. As baby boomers retire, the
number of workers will fall – and potential growth with it. Accordingly, we must
make work easier and more rewarding.
[10]

One lever is to help part‑time workers increase their hours if they wish –
 especially women. Annual hours per worker in Germany are low based on stand‐
ards in the advanced economies. One reason stems from disincentives relating
to taxes and social security contributions. Childcare and eldercare provision is
another major constraint. Better care provision, longer opening hours and more
ﬂexibility could increase labour supply.
Germany also needs labour market-oriented migration. The reformed Skilled
Immigration Act creates opportunities in this area. But red tape is an issue here
as well – procedures remain too slow and too complex. A “work and stay”
approach – involving faster digital processing, simpler recognition of qualiﬁca‐
tions and better integration – would help. Language training and residency
rights for family members could improve worker retention. In the current
setting, many intra‑EU (European Union) migrants leave the country within two
years.
Furthermore, Germany should tap the potential of older workers. It makes sense
to link the earliest retirement age – and then the statutory retirement age after
2031 – to life expectancy. Ending the option to retire early without deductions
after 45 years of contributions would reduce the incentive to leave the workforce
early. 
Together, these steps would ease labour shortages, support growth and
strengthen pension ﬁnancing. 
4 Need for European reforms
National reforms are vital to meet Germany’s challenges. But many decisive
issues will be determined at the European level. 
One example is trade. Germany – like the Republic of Korea – thrives in an open,
rules‑based global trading system. Rising protectionism makes that harder. In
the face of this, Europe must stay committed to a rules‑based global trade
order. 

As long as worldwide trade reform is not feasible, striking free trade agreements
with like‑minded partners is a promising way forward. Deepening ties with the
members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Paciﬁc
Partnership
(CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership))
is one avenue. Strengthening trade and investment links between the
EU (European Union) and Korea is another.
At the same time, Europe needs deeper integration and greater resilience.
4.1 Deepening European integration
Greater integration is necessary on three fronts: economics, ﬁnance and energy.
4.1.1 Economic integration
Let us start with economic integration.
The free movement of goods, services, capital and people is a cornerstone of the
European Union. For goods and people, integration has advanced substantially.
 But fragmented national rules are still hampering trade in services to a signi‐
ﬁcantly larger extent. 
Removing barriers could boost competition and productivity. The digital revolu‐
tion might help here. For example, a uniﬁed digital single market would allow
professionals to work and ﬁrms to sell services across borders with ease.
Another solution would be an optional “28th regime”. The idea here is to estab‐
lish an EU (European Union)-wide legal framework that companies can opt into
instead of navigating 27 national rulebooks. This would make cross-border oper‐
ations easier.
4.1.2 Financial integration
The second area in which Europe needs deeper integration is ﬁnance. 
The European Union aims to build a Savings and Investments Union. In short,
the idea of this concept is to channel more of Europe’s signiﬁcant household
savings into domestic investment. At present, households predominantly
channel their savings into safe products like deposits. At the same time, start-
ups have diﬃculty raising funds, while some larger ﬁrms leave Europe in order
to scale up.
[11]

The key is to diversify ﬁrms’ funding towards more equity, market‑based debt
and venture capital. What should be done here?
First, ﬁrms need better access to equity. For small, innovative start-ups, that
means better access to venture capital. For established ﬁrms looking to expand,
that means deeper, more liquid capital markets.
Second, a deeper securitisation market would help banks to transfer risk from
their balance sheets to ﬁnancial markets. In turn, that would free up banks’ addi‐
tional lending capacity.
Finally, households and institutional investors need encouragement to buy more
of these assets. For households, better ﬁnancial literacy would empower them to
make informed decisions and seize opportunities in the capital markets. For
institutional investors, we should review whether some regulatory hurdles to
capital markets investments could be eased.
Once completed, the Savings and Investments Union will help to mobilise capital
for green projects, defence and innovation. It would also make Europe more
attractive to global investors at a time when relative attractiveness is being
reassessed.
4.1.3 Energy system integration
Finally, integrating European energy markets should be another priority. 
The European Union aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The European
Commission estimates that EU (European Union) countries will have to invest
over €1.2 trillion annually from 2021 to 2030.
Today, Europe’s power systems are still mainly national. Better cross‑border
grids and market coupling would align supply and demand more eﬃciently. That
would cut reliance on costly reserve capacity and speed up the rollout of renew‐
ables. In eﬀect, energy integration would lower energy prices and further
strengthen both climate policy and energy security.
4.2 Fostering European resilience
Alongside integration, Europe must increase its resilience. 
[12]

4.2.1 Defence
First and foremost, Europe needs closer defence coordination on strategy, per‐
sonnel, procurement and production. We should also work with partners beyond
the EU (European Union), such as the UK (United Kingdom) and Norway. 
The European Commission’s Readiness 2030 strategy is a step in the right direc‐
tion. Amongst other things, it aims to create a single market for defence goods.
This would deliver scale, lower unit costs and save billions each year.
Even so, defence spending will be structurally higher for years to come. That,
inevitably, raises the question of ﬁnancing. In the European Union, debt ﬁnan‐
cing is limited by ﬁscal rules. They safeguard sound, sustainable public ﬁnances –
 a precondition for monetary policy to deliver on its price stability mandate. 
Given the urgency, temporary exceptions can help to mobilise resources quickly.
But permanently higher outlays must be aligned with the European framework
for sound public ﬁnances.
4.2.2 Payments
Payments is another area in which Europe has to build resilience. Europe cur‐
rently relies heavily on non‑European payment providers. 
At present, about two-thirds of all card payments in the euro area are processed
by non-European providers such as Visa and Mastercard – and often on servers
outside Europe. That creates dependencies and leaves us vulnerable to geopolit‐
ical risks. And if US (United States) dollar stablecoins were to become wide‐
spread in Europe, our reliance on American providers could become even
greater.
A central bank digital currency (CBDC (central bank digital currency)) in the euro
area would secure control over critical infrastructure and make us less depend‐
ent on non‑European providers. Where do we stand here?
In terms of the retail variant – the digital euro – the Eurosystem has just con‐
cluded its preparation phase.  It will now start to build the necessary technical
capacity ahead of a possible decision to issue the currency. What we still need is
a legal basis for the digital euro. It is now up to the European Parliament and the
Council to give the green light. I really hope that we will see swift progress here.
[13]
[14]

For wholesale CBDC (central bank digital currency), the Eurosystem has recently
tested three diﬀerent solutions involving market participants. I am proud to say
that the Bundesbank, through the Trigger Solution developed by our Payment
and Settlement experts, has played a decisive role in this endeavour. Demand
was strong and market participants showed clear interest in moving beyond the
trials. Just recently, the Eurosystem started working on the Pontes project – a dis‐
tributed ledger technology (DLT (distributed ledger technology)) solution that
links market DLT (distributed ledger technology) platforms and
TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement ExpressTransfer System)
Services to settle transactions in central bank money.
Taken together, strengthening our defence capabilities and bringing the euro
into the digital age would increase Europe’s resilience.
5 Euro area monetary policy
Ladies and gentlemen, so far, I have spoken about broader economic policy
issues. They matter for central bankers because they shape the medium‑term
outlook for inﬂation as well as growth. Let me close my speech by explaining
how we conduct monetary policy in the euro area and discussing the current
monetary policy outlook. 
Unlike the Bank of Korea, the Deutsche Bundesbank does not set monetary
policy on its own. Rather, Germany is part of a monetary union with 19 other
European countries – the euro area. Together, the 20 national central banks and
the European Central Bank (ECB (European Central Bank)) form the Eurosystem.
As an aside, as of January there will be 21 member states, with Bulgaria set to
join the Eurosystem.
Monetary policy decisions in the Eurosystem are taken by the
ECB (European Central Bank)’s Governing Council. It includes the 20 national
central bank governors and the ECB (European Central Bank)’s Executive Board,
led by President Christine Lagarde. The Governing Council meets eight times per
year to set monetary policy.
[15]

At every other policy meeting, Eurosystem or ECB (European Central Bank) staﬀ
present projections for inﬂation, growth and other key variables. These forecasts
provide vital input to our monetary policy decisions. They are published four
times a year – in March, June, September and December. So much for the institu‐
tional set-up. 
Over the last couple of years, interest rates in the euro area have been on a
rollercoaster ride. After a long period of negative interest rates, the Eurosystem
reacted forcefully to the inﬂation surge that began in 2021 and reached its peak
in 2022. Between July 2022 and September 2023, interest rates were hiked ten
times, by a total of 450 basis points.
In June 2024, the Eurosystem began to lower rates again. By June this year, they
had fallen by 200 basis points. At its July, September and October meetings, the
ECB (European Central Bank)’s Governing Council left interest rates unchanged.
The Eurosystem currently uses the deposit facility rate to implement its desired
policy stance, since liquidity remains ample. At present, this rate stands at 2 per
cent. So where does that leave us?
One way to judge whether rates are in the right place is the natural rate of
interest. This is deﬁned as the interest rate that is consistent with growth at
potential and stable prices. As we cannot observe it directly, we have to estimate
it.
Our latest Bundesbank estimates for the third quarter of 2025, drawing on a
broad range of models, point to values between 1.7 and 2.6 per cent in nominal
terms. Eurosystem model-based calculations in spring 2025 put the nominal
natural rate between 1.75 and 2.25 per cent.  Accordingly, the current rate of 2
per cent sits more or less in the middle of those ranges.
This suggests that Eurosystem monetary policy is broadly neutral right now.
However, this assessment should be taken with a grain of salt, because estimates
of the neutral rate are inherently uncertain. 
[16]

Our inﬂation projections are a better guide for interest rate decisions.  In the
latest projections from September 2025, ECB (European Central Bank) staﬀ
expected inﬂation to average around 2 per cent over the next three years,
including a slight dip in 2026.  Euro area growth over the same period should
average about 1.2 per cent. That is very close to the European Commission’s
estimate of potential growth of 1.1 per cent for 2026. 
Moreover, the projections have been quite stable for some time now. Taken
together, our projections also suggest that interest rates are currently in a good
place.
Right now, Eurosystem staﬀ are ﬁnalising projections to be published in conjunc‐
tion with the ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council’s December
meeting. They will include an initial projection for 2028. Based on these fore‐
casts, we will be able to determine whether we are still on track to meet our
medium‑term inﬂation target.
6 Concluding remarks
Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.
Germany and the Republic of Korea face similar challenges. I hope my remarks
have given you a clear view of how Germany and Europe could tackle these
challenges.
To increase its potential growth, Germany has to cut red tape, reduce energy
costs and expand its labour supply. At the European level, we need to deepen
the Single Market, ﬁnalise the Savings and Investments Union, integrate energy
markets and boost Europe’s resilience in defence and payments.
I truly appreciate being here in the Republic of Korea and learning from your
experiences. By deepening ties between our two countries, we can learn from
each other and make faster progress.
For now, I look forward to our discussion.
Thank you for your attention.
