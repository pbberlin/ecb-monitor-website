Ladies and Gentlemen,  
It is a great pleasure to be in London today for this OMFIF meeting and I am 
grateful for your kind invitation . By the way, today is history for our single 
currency, the euro: we announced this morning a decisive step toward future 
banknotes. We will have to decide between two possible themes by next year: 
culture, with six prominent Europeans, and rivers and birds. These banknotes 
will much better represent Europe, and embody the historically high support of 
81% of European citizens for their single currency.  That said, I would like to 
share with you some insights about two recent monetary developments. I will 
first comment on short-term rates and yesterday’s monetary policy decision (I) 
and then highlight some challenges against a backdrop of rising long-term rates 
(II). 
 
I. On ECB short-term rates: a clear direction, and a pragmatic pace  
 
Yesterday, our Governing Council, led by President Lagarde, decided 
unanimously a fifth cut, and a fourth in a row. Compared to other major central 
banks, ECB has been the earliest to cut, the lowest to go, and probably has the 
clearest path in its monetary course. To put it in a nutshell: as the ECB president 
said, we are precisely on track in our victorious fight against inflation. We know 
there is a discussion whether this success is the result of luck –  reversal of 
commodity prices – or of central banks work. Both, to be honest : but monetary 
policy played its significant part. There are different models used by various 
European NCBs and the ECB itself: but all of them converge to a conservative  
estimate of monetary policy having reduced inflation by about 2% in 2023 as 
well as in 2024.  
Looking ahead, we should be sustainably around our 2% inflation target by this 
summer. The French flash inflation in January published this morning, stable at 
1.8% and slightly lower than expected, is good news on this road: services 
inflation in particular seems to be receding . We s ee significant wage 
deceleration and are hence confident on core inflation decrease, including 

Page 2 sur 6 
 
services. And on activity, we avoided recession last year with 0.7% growth, and 
will again avoid it this year.  But the somewhat disappointing GDP stagnation in 
Q4 published yesterday confirms that risks on growth are clearly tilted to the 
downside.  
With such a “disinflationary slowdown”, the direction of the travel is clear: our 
monetary policy will go from restrictive towards neutral, and should support a 
gradual recovery while ensuring inflation is at our target. How fast and how  far 
should we go in this travel? This is where what I call “agile pragmatism” and 
our data driven approach will guide us. I don’t want to bother you today with a 
sophisticated discussion about the precise level of R*… Furthermore, long term 
yields have increased, limiting the easing of overall financial conditions.  
II. A more challenging view on long-term yields 
 
A) Unusual divergence between short and long-term rates  
The ECB, since last June, and the US Federal Reserve, since last September, 
began a rate cutting cycle and both have reduced their policy rates by 100 bp  
last year. But over the same period longer term yields have increased, 
particularly in the US which is very unusual compared to previous easing cycles. 
The US 10-year yield is now up by more than 80 basis points since the Fed 
started cutting rates and the so -called “Trump trade” began  while previous 
easing phases were initially associated with a fall in long yields.

In the euro area, long-term rates have also increased but to a lesser extent and 
the US 10- year spread relative to EA OIS has risen by  80 bps over the same 
period.  
 
B) What can explain this rise in long yields?  
The sovereign debt trajectories and the elevated global policy uncertainties are 
likely the two main factors. Fiscal deficits remain high i n many advanced 
economies (US, UK, FR); even in Germany, fiscal policy might become more 
expansionary after the elections . Uncertainty about the trajectory of public 
finances is putting upward pressure on sovereign yields.  
Macroeconomic factors are also at play, even though quite differently on both 
sides of the Atlantic. In the US, the risk of future t rade restrictions and possibly 
immigration policies  keep uncertainty about the outlook and inflation high, 
directly affecting risk premia.  In the short run, these measures are akin to 
negative supply shocks and likely to  be inflationary, before possible reversal in 
the long er run as aggregate demand could weaken. For now , the growth 
perspectives remain strong in the US, as confirmed by recent robust labour 
market data, and option -implied distributions of inflation expectations show 
upside risks to inflation. In  that context, markets expect the Fed to cut interest 
rates less this year than previously anticipated. The expectations component is 
estimated to account for about two-thirds of the increase in the 10-year Treasury 
yield since mid-September.  


Page 4 sur 6 
 
 
The macroeconomic picture is different in the euro area. The disinflation 
trajectory is more clear-cut and the macro outlook is weaker. The contagion to 
European yields from higher US interest rates has thus been limited so far : 
monetary policy perspectives could and should rightly decouple . But spillovers 
on the bond markets operate also through the global risk channel. In a more 
uncertain global environment, investors require higher compensation for lending 
long term , which results in higher term premia. The contribution of the term 
premium to the change in OIS 10-year rates since mid-September is almost 15 
bp. The impact of this rise in the term premium on  financial conditions in the 
euro area is however mitigated by the depreciation of the euro/dollar exch ange 
rate which has occurred during the same period. 
C) The role of unwinding QE shouldn’t be overstated 
Some commentators argue that the end of QE has contributed to the rise in 
long-term yields. This interpretation goes back to the initial objective of QE. 
Asset purchase programmes were launched in times of crisis and when rates 
were at the effective lower bound ( ELB) for two reasons:  1) to preserve an 
effective monetary policy  transmission when specific market segments were 
under strain – which is not relevant today, and 2) to provide additional policy 
space when required (i.e. monetary stance  purpose). In that latter case, 
purchases of long-term bonds aimed at compressing the term premium and 
therefore the long term yields, to stimulate aggregate demand. 
In principle, “quantitative tightening”, i.e. the full unwinding of all large scale 
asset purchases would drive the market back to the status quo ante. But there 


Page 5 sur 6 
 
are two reasons to discount this; and the wording itself of “QT” is somewhat 
misleading.  First, passive and bounded “QT” is not the symmetric of active and 
open-ended QE: QE ramped up quickly but unwinds much more slowly. Recent 
researchi finds that asset purchases had powerful effects during period s of 
market stress. We should not expect to go back to crisis yields. As a matter of 
fact the term premium has been contained since the end of the reinvestments 
under the APP ( July 2023) and the PEPP (December 2024). Second, QT is 
completely predictable and none of the parameters have changed since last 
summer. For both programmes the Governing Council announced months in 
advance the date at which reinvestments would be disconti nued and market  
reactions at that time were very muted.  
D) To conclude, let me draw a few lessons regarding the use of balance -sheet 
tools in the future. 
1) First, when the primary goal of QE is transmission or financial stability , 
there is no reason to hold the assets to maturity or to take excessive duration 
risk. There is no obligation to re-sell at short notice but there should be an option 
open at any time. More generally, QE is not necessarily the first-line instrument 
to restore appropriate transmi ssion. TLTROs or large scale liquidity provision 
are other effective tools to address transmission impairments in the banking 
system.  
2) Second, when the goal is to ease further the monetary  stance while interest 
rates have reached their lower bound, then we should distinguish whether we 
aim to provide liquidity (i.e. volumes) or to reduce long-term rates (i.e. prices).  
If the primary objective is to inject liquidity , it should  not be done through 
purchases of long-term bonds, but by lending short term or at floating rates for 
LTROs. By the way, these were a powerful and successful innovation of the 
ECB, not used in the US. But the initial pricing of TLTRO III at quasi-fixed rates 
was not fully appropriate and had to be later recalibrated. 
“Core QE” – i.e. purchasing and holding long-term bonds – should be used 
for the purpose of reducing the term premium and therefore the long-term yields. 
If this purpose is clear and warranted, we should admit that it entails taking 

Page 6 sur 6 
 
interest rate risk onto our balance sheet, and hence possible losses as we have 
seen recently. We should then be ready to accept such risks, while looking more 
closely at the average maturity of the purchased portfolio.  
3) In our portfolio holdings, we should prioritize government and supranational 
bonds to limit our direct balance sheet exposure to the non -financial corporate 
sector. That being said, such programmes are not and should never be 
designed to fund governments nor to help fiscal stimulus.  
4) Fourth and finally, we should not condition one instrument on another.  
Doing so creates communication issues if one programme  has to be stopped. 
For instance, using asset purchases to make forward guidance more credible 
can turn out to be unwise, as we saw early 2022 when we had to gradually 
discontinue asset purchases before being able to raise rates.

I will end with a few lines from a French poet, Joachim du Bellay ii in the 16 th 
century: “Happy is the one, who like Ulysses, has completed a beautiful journey 
(…) And has then returned, full of wisdom and reason”. The last ten years have 
been anything but a beautiful journey  for us central bankers; however, victory 
over inflation is now in sight . Like Ulysses, we have been through an 
unprecedented sequence of monetary policy challenges: this valuable 
experience gave us humility  but also some confidence to face  the next steps 
ahead. These include adjusting while keeping our toolkit, which will be a focus 
of our interim Strategy Review. Thank you for your attention.
