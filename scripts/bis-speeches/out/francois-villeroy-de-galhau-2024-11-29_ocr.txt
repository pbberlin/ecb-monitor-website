Towards a realistic simplification:
untying some of the knots In
European banking regulations
Published on the 26th of November 2024
Speech by Francois Villeroy de Galhau,
Governor of the Banque de France, Chairman of the ACPR


Ladies and Gentlemen,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to another ACPR Conference,
which this year focuses on the topic of innovation: “the financial sector
innovates, supervision evolves”. As a supervisor, talking about innovation
of course means trying to strike the right balance between two
ostensibly contradictory goals, which we nonetheless want to reconcile:
the 2S’s — Security for the financial sector and Support for economic
development. But there is a third S, which can help to achieve this
compatibility: Simplification.
Following the 2007-09 global crisis, we took significant and much-
needed steps to strengthen financial sector regulation. We have now
reached the end of a cycle, with the implementation of the final package
of Basel Ill. This therefore now seems to be the right time to take a
much-needed step back: it is not enough for the regulatory principles
themselves to be sound — we also need to ensure that the complexity of
our existing regulation does not constitute an obstacle to achieving our
goals.
There now appears to be a new consensus in Europe in favour of
simplification. The Draghi report,'! and before that the Letta report,
singled out regulatory simplification as one of the keys to European
competitiveness: more speed for more innovation and more growth. The
European Commission has made easing the regulatory burden — and
especially reducing reporting obligations by at least 25%" -— one of the
focuses of its forthcoming mandate. The Single Supervisory Mechanism
(SSM) has decided to modify its Supervisory Review and Evaluation
Process (SREP) and make it more simple and flexible. | am convinced
that, for financial stability, we also now need regulatory stability.
However, simplifying does not mean deregulating, and let us
acknowledge that simplifying is actually not quite that simple (1). | will
then set out some practical priorities for achieving simplification (Il).


More than 15 years have passed since the Great Financial Crisis — 1 do
not need to remind you of the social, economic and financial damage it
caused. Lessons were learned, thanks to intense international
cooperation, but as time passes, the “temptation to forget” returns,
along with calls to go back to the way things were. This temptation is
dangerous: Basel Ill rules allowed financial institutions to weather the
Covid-19 crisis, and stopped the health and economic crisis from turning
into a financial crisis. They subsequently prevented the interest rate
hikes from jeopardising financial stability, and stopped the fallout from
the collapse of SVB in March 2023 from spreading to Europe.
Today, of course, a wind of deregulation appears to be blowing on the
other side of the Atlantic. So let us be clear and factual: the final Basel III
rules have already been published by two thirds of the 27 Basel
Committee member jurisdictions, and have already entered into force in
more than a third, including Japan, Canada and China. In Europe, they
will enter into force on 1 January 2025." .

Etat des lieux de l'adoption des standards de Bale iii, AU 30/09/2024


This framework must continue to form the international basis for banking
regulation. It will of course apply to European subsidiaries of US banks.
We remain hopeful that US authorities will transpose Basel Ill into
national law: indeed, it may be in the interests of big American banks to
align with international standards. However, if the United States does
decide to opt out, European supervisors and legislators will take great
care to maintain a competitive level playing field across the main
jurisdictions. The European banking package contains certain tools
allowing us to adjust our regulations to competitive challenges when this
is justified, especially when it comes to market risks. The Commission
has already postponed the entry into force of the new rules concerning
the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) by a year. Moreover,
failing to regulate non-banks and crypto-assets today would just sow the
seeds for tomorrow’s financial crisis. Both these sectors are growing
rapidly, and the G20 and FSB have adopted clear guiding principles for
them. It is in everyone's interest to support them, rather than multiplying
the future risks — including in the United States — stemming from
different supervisors taking their own individual decisions, from legal
disputes, and from the collapse of players whose value has been
artificially inflated — let’s not forget what happened to LTCM in 1998, and
FTX in 2022.
In short, simplifying does not mean deregulating. On the contrary, it
means regulating more effectively: having fewer regulations but
implementing them better and thereby making them more efficient.
2. Simplifying that simple


The unsatisfactory situation in Europe in this regard can give rise to
pessimism: not only do we have more legislative proposals than 20 years
ago — 431 in the 2019-24 period, compared with 374 between 1999 and
2004 - but they have also doubled in length — an average of 8,600 words
in 2019-24, compared with 4,500 previously.” This is not simply the
result of bureaucratic blindness that is all too easily vilified: the different
European authorities are doing their job both competently and
conscientiously. But in Europe at least, there are clear structural causes
that are also potential levers for improvement. First, there is an
accumulation of international, European and national standards, with the
constant temptation to add more. There is also the fact that each
country always wants to keep the previous rules, making it nearly
impossible to lighten the burden when a new regulation is introduced.
There are also numerous bodies in charge — the SSM with its
microprudential role, the ECB and the European Systemic Risk Board
(ESRB) with their macroprudential role, the SRM for resolution, European
agencies including the European Banking Authority (EBA) for banks, and
the various national authorities... The ACPR does not claim to be perfect,
although it does have a reputation for being an expert in its sector and
for focusing on substance rather than procedure.
There are also too many directives that need to be transposed into
national law, and not enough regulations that apply directly. Added to
this is the ongoing too high level of mistrust between states, meaning
that rules have to be set out clearly specified in great detail, at times at
the request of the industry itself. By way of example, in the last banking
package, the EBA — whose work is essential - was entrusted with
approximately 140 mandates to draft technical standards and guidelines
. This mistrust also leads to an obsession with an internal level playing
field, between Member States, whereas we should be just as concerned
with ensuring an externa! level playing field, with the rest of the world.
Yes, technological innovation and artificial intelligence will help us to
manage big data. But we should not simply use innovation as a crutch to
carry us in the same wrong direction. First, because technology cannot
do everything: it cannot manage the ambiguities caused by complexity.
To have efficient technology, we need clean, standardised and
consistent data. Second, because adding technological complexity to
offset regulatory complexity is merely lowering the chances that humans


will retain control and this would result in us losing sight of our goal of
achieving real security.
So there is no magic wand, no simplification revolution, but resolute
action based around a small number of practical priorities. | would like to
put forward three of these, without claiming to be exhaustive. | know
that several of my European colleagues — like certain national treasuries
— are thinking along these lines in terms of a realistic simplification.
REP of tomorrow’ over the
Let’s start with a concrete example of what the SSM has begun to do to
ensure that its Supervisory Review And Evaluation Process - the SREP -
more effectively reflects a risk-based approach involving greater
prioritisation of supervisory activities. The SSM Supervisory Board has
adopted two broad principles. First, developing a multi-year approach to
the SREP, with the possibility of updating decisions every two years
rather than every year if there has been no significant change in a bank's
risk profile. Second, greater focus on key expectations and outcomes,
with more effective use of the escalation ladder if deficiencies have not
been remediated after a long period. The SREP process will therefore be
shorter, with decisions sent to the majority of banks in September. | will
also support any initiative to standardise supervision tools at the SSM
level, as this will make the best use of resources and enhance efficiency.
As regards our internal functioning, there is still room to fine-tune the
organisation between vertical and horizontal supervisory activities, in
order to reduce the ‘prudential burden’ for both banks and supervisors.
These simplification measures can represent real progress, which
obviously still need to be effectively implemented in practice - we will
make sure that they are - but whose aim is to make prudential oversight
more responsive and focused on priority risks.
2 Developing an overview of the rules to


We are simplifying supervision, now we need to streamline regulations,
while complying with the Basel standards, which remains our
benchmark. First, we need to recognise that it is not easy to compare
capital requirements across the major jurisdictions. Differences in
business models, specific legal aspects, possible divergences and other
overlapping requirements outside the Basel Ill framework mean that
comparisons quickly become tricky. We should simply note that the
major European banks generally have a higher CET1 capital ratio than the
major US banks - 14.3% compared with 13.9% on average.
However, it is easier to compare the complexity of regulations. As the
EBA report“ published last summer clearly shows, in Europe, there are
many more overlapping layers of microprudential and macroprudential
capital requirement regulations and triggers of automatic restrictions on
distributions than in the United States or the United Kingdom.

Comparaison des exigences prudentielles bancaires : le cas du cadre applicable pour les
fonds propres


In Europe, we have multiplied institutions and requirements, whereas
Basel and our counterpart institutions have opted for a simpler approach.
Are we to assume that we are systematically the only ones in the right?
As we have reached the end of a regulation cycle in the wake of the
Great Financial Crisis, our priority could now be to develop a “holistic”
view of the rules that apply to European banks, which will enable us to
compare ourselves at the international level. This work obviously needs
to be carried out under the aegis of the European Commission and
involve all of the European supervisory authorities. We need a
comprehensive analysis of the impact of all the new standards produced
in Europe — including at levels 2 and 3 — to ensure that they do not add
another layer of capital requirements in addition to what is provided for
in the political agreement in respect of the level 1 text.
Next, we will need to have the courage and lucidity to simplify
regulations in areas where Europe is considerably out of line. In terms of
resolution, | am thinking in particular of the fit between TLAC loss
absorbing capacity requirements under Basel and MREL, which is a
European invention. | am also thinking of the different parallel
frameworks for automatic restriction on distributions, which can create
uncertainty in the forward-looking management of a firms' capital.
Neither should we exclude the need to consider the need for a more
radical approach to simplifying capital requirements, factoring in the
experience of other major jurisdictions, such as the United States, where
the stress capital buffer set up by the Federal Reserve combines a
number of micro and macroprudential objectives. Comparisons can be
misleading, but they are not a bad place to start! At the end of its
comprehensive review, the Commission could put forward a legislative
proposal to simplify the European prudential framework — one that is still
Basel-compliant, but more effective.
Lastly, | would like to reiterate the need to finally start making progress
on cross-border banking integration within the European Union, focusing
on two areas: removing “host” country obstacles to cross-border
liquidity (and capital) flows, with sufficient guarantees in terms of intra-
group support mechanisms in the event of a crisis; and setting up a
hybrid deposit guarantee system to ensure European support for
national systems as a last resort.TM!!


g the consistency of the different3. Ensurin
ulations
There is one crucial area in Europe where we are thankfully at the
forefront, but which is representative of a certain build-up overlapping
regulations, namely that of climate change. I'll say it again loud and clear:
this is essential if the financial sector is to be able to contend with the
very real risks to which it is exposed. No one can doubt the pioneering
commitment of the Banque de France and the ACPR in this area,
however, if these regulations become too complex and difficult to
understand, there is a risk they will be applied poorly or not implemented
at all.
That's why it is vital that we continue to work towards two objectives.
First, it is essential to achieve the most unified regulations possible in
Europe, instead of a plethora of regulations including — to name but a few
— the SFDR regulation, the CSRD* and CSDDD*' directives, and
France's Energy and Climate Act*' , which preceded the European
regulations. Each of these regulations, often issued by different bodies,
represented legitimate progress at the time, however, their accumulation
now clearly lacks overall consistency. Let's stick to the objective but, at
the very least, bring the definitions closer together and avoid duplicating
requests for data. Secondly, we need to come up with a single transition
plan per institution, summarising prudential requirements under the CRD
directiveTM" and net-zero alignment requirements under the CSRD and
the CSDDD. This is vital if we are to set credible targets for financial
institutions. And one day, we will perhaps be able to go further in
aligning European EFRAG*" and international ISSB*” standards.
In conclusion, | am convinced that a safer banking sector can go hand in
hand with simpler rules. Not fewer capital and liquidity safeguards, but
less procedural burden. Certainly not less Basel Ill - but sometimes less
European sophisticated regulations. Our rules can only gain in legitimacy
and effectiveness. René Char, in his collection Les Matinaux, spoke of
‘man’s curious illness of tying knots’*”' Now is the time to start untying
them.
