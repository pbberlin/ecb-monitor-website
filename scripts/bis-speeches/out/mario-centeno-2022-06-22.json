How we work together as Portuguese, Europeans, as Global Democracies.</p>\n<p>To motivate this morning debate, allow me to ask you to travel back in time with me. Not as far as the year of the creation of Banco de Portugal, 1846, but only back five years, to 2017. </p>\n<p>That was the year when Portugal exited an 8-year-period of non-compliance with the European Union institutional framework regarding national budget deficits (the 3 percent threshold). </p>\n<p>By any standards, 8 years of Excessive Deficit Procedures is, allow me the pun, excessive. The social capital of Portugal in the European Union was, probably, at its lowest level. </p>\n<p>But, according to an opinion poll conducted in mid-2017, the feat of exiting the Excessive Deficit Procedure increased the Portugueses' self-esteem more than winning for the first time the European football cup or the Eurovision song contest. </p>\n<p>For you to have an idea, as of how broad this effect was, I just need to let you know that it was true for both the subsample of men and women.</p>\n<p>To me, this demonstrates how citizens value the commitment to social contracts. That is why central banks must nourish and enhance the social capital of our societies. It is essential for economic and social development.</p>\n<p>For that reason, our Strategic Plan moto for 2021-2025 is \"proximity and trust\" with those who we must serve, the Portuguese citizens.</p>\n<p>As a central bank, Banco de Portugal plays a key role in the process of consolidation of the country's social capital. We are committed to this built-up process, so that together we can successfully overcome the challenges ahead. </p>\n<p>At this juncture in time, the historical challenges are considerable. In addition to the pressing debt legacy, climate change and digital transition challenges – particularly important in the traditional banking sector –, the economy was hit by two exogenous, now partially overlapping, shocks: the Covid pandemic and the Russia war on Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The short-term effects are clear. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, in itself a demonstration of the lack of social capital, is slowing down the recovery. Also it is causing an inflationary environment, adding to the ones already in place, and temporary, due to the fast recovery from the COVID crisis. The new pressures on prices result from the escalation of commodity and energy prices, reduced confidence of economic agents and the effects of commercial and financial sanctions imposed on Russia. </p>\n<p>In this context, a coordinated set of national and European policy actions is crucial to ensure sustainable growth in our economies. </p>\n<p>For the Portuguese economy, there are two main courses of action to overcome successfully the challenges ahead.</p>\n<p>At the national level, Portugal must continue to champion education. For many decades, which add up to centuries, Portugal lagged behind in the development race by neglecting the main driver: education. Claudia Goldin and Larry Katz have dubbed the twentieth century as the \"Human Capital Century\". </p>\n<p>For Portugal, the twentieth century arrived only on the twenty first century. But ever since we have been keen to take that opportunity. </p>\n<p>Knowing that social capital does not depreciate if used, but, on the contrary, it tends to enhance, we must remain resolute in the education front. This is a necessary condition to ensure our convergence within Europe. </p>\n<p>Moreover, by investing in education, we increase the equality of opportunities, we reduce income and wealth inequalities and improve our labour force. </p>\n<p>Above all, we boost the country's social capital. We promote horizontal and participative institutions.  </p>\n<p>The recent reaction to the COVID crisis was a leap of integration in Europe because it was widely accepted by all Europeans.
