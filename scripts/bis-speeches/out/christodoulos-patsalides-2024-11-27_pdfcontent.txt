Distinguished co-speakers and guests, ladies and gentlemen.
It is a pleasure to join you today to discuss the future aspects of monetary policy and 
the role of the banking system in the face of increased uncertainty.
So let me begin with the  . The Governing Council current discussion on interest rates
of the ECB, at its meeting in October, advanced its policy easing as our assessment of 
the latest data confirmed significant progress in the disinflationary process, with inflation 
in October standing at 2.0%. Going forward, the pace and magnitude of further rate cuts 
remain a subject of ongoing assessment.  
While growth in the euro-area economy has been anaemic for some time now, the 
approach to rate cuts must be gradual and data-driven. Inflationary pressures, 
particularly those stemming from potential supply shocks, still pose risks. There is still 
considerable uncertainty with regard to energy prices and services inflation continues to 
be sticky at 4%. Moreover, trade tensions are rising. If trade restrictions materialise, the 
outcome may be inflationary, recessionary, or worse, stagflationary.
If incoming data and new projections in December confirm our baseline scenario, there 
will be room to continue lowering rates at a steady pace and magnitude. In general, 
striking the right balance is essential, as overly aggressive rate cuts could risk reigniting 
inflationary pressures, while cutting rates too slowly might unnecessarily hinder 
economic recovery and dampen market confidence. At this juncture, monetary policy is 
a balancing act, and these considerations confirm that maintaining optionality without 
any predefined path is the prudent avenue for our policy calibration.
I would now like to offer a few remarks on the  , which, in European banking sector
recent years, has shown remarkable resilience despite facing significant economic and 
geopolitical turmoil. The latest key indicators of June 2024, support the aforementioned 
with the liquidity ratio reaching 163,2%, the CET1 ratio increasing to 17,5% and the 
Non-Performing Loans ratio remaining relatively steady at 1,9%. It is fair to say that the 
Single Supervisory Mechanism, celebrating this year its 10-year anniversary, is 
delivering exceptional outcomes.
However, the outlook for the euro area remains highly uncertain, shaped by tighter 
financing conditions, heightened geopolitical tensions, and significant rising risks, such 
as climate and cyber risks. Both the SSM and the European Banking Authority have 
incorporated these risks into their supervisory and regulatory priorities.  Banks are

required to align their practices with the relevant guidelines and take the necessary 
steps to incorporate these risks in their business models. The ECB's strategy for the 
next three years is focused on addressing these challenges effectively.
Yet, as is, the banking sector alone cannot drive the transformative changes needed in 
the European economic landscape. The pursuit of a stronger and more competitive 
European economy requires the establishment of a truly integrated capital markets 
union and the completion of the banking union with the introduction of a common 
deposit guarantee scheme. The alarming reality is that Europe is falling behind with 
much lower productivity levels compared to the United States. This challenge is further 
intensified by growing competition from other economies like China. This requires bold 
structural reforms to effectively channel savings into productive and innovative private 
investments. 
The Draghi Report provides the right recipes to achieve these goals. It also sheds light 
on key weaknesses in the European economy and offers actionable guidance. At the 
EU level, deeper capital markets and financial integration will close the innovation gap, 
particularly by strengthening the European venture capital market, which significantly 
lacks behind that of the US. In fact, The Financial Stability Review of the ECB published 
yesterday, shows that the US venture capital market is five times larger than that of the 
euro area. Diversifying financing options for European firms, beyond traditional bank 
lending, is also crucial. Encouraging IPOs and equity investments for start-ups and 
scale-ups can be achieved by reducing regulatory barriers, especially in advanced 
digital technologies. Additionally, having a single supervisor for EU capital markets, 
would ensure consistent risk treatment, reduce fragmentation, and boost confidence in 
EU capital markets-key steps toward realizing a unified capital market.
Overall, as we navigate the broader euro-area monetary policy landscape, the 
resilience of the European banking sector remains a cornerstone for ensuring stability in 
the face of economic uncertainties.
Thank you.
