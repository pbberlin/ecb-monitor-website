It is a pleasure to be here at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE): 
your impressive research on a wide range of topics is extremely valuable for 
policymakers.1
At last week's monetary policy meeting, the ECB's Governing Council decided to lower 
the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – 
by 25 basis points from 3.0 per cent to 2.75 per cent. In cumulative terms, the deposit 
facility rate has declined by 125 basis points since last June. The decision reflected our 
updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and 
the strength of monetary policy transmission.
In what follows, I will explain in more detail the basis for this decision. I will review 
inflation developments, economic developments, our risk assessment, and financial and 
monetary conditions. Finally, I explain why pursuing a middle path for monetary policy is 
best suited to the current environment.
Inflation developments
The disinflation process remains well on track. Inflation has continued to develop 
broadly in line with the staff projections and is set to return to our two per cent medium-
term target in the course of this year. Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that 
inflation will settle at around our target on a sustained basis. The Persistent and 
Common Component of Inflation (PCCI), which has the best predictive power among 
underlying inflation indicators for future headline inflation, continued to hover around 
two per cent in the December data, indicating that headline inflation is set to stabilise 
around our target.
Domestic inflation, at 4.2 per cent, stayed well above all the other indicators in 
December mostly because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the 
past inflation surge with a substantial delay. However, the PCCI for services, which 
should act as an underlying attractor for services inflation and domestic inflation, fell to 
2.3 per cent.
The anticipation of a downward shift in services inflation in the coming months also 
relates to the expected deceleration in wage growth in the course of 2025. Wages have 
been adjusting to the past inflation surges with a substantial delay, but the ECB wage 
tracker and the latest surveys point to a significant moderation in wage pressures this 
year. According to the latest results of the Survey on the Access to Finance of 

2/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Enterprises (SAFE), firms expect wages to grow by 3.3 per cent on average over the 
next twelve months, down from 4.5 per cent this time last year. Similarly, the latest 
Corporate Telephone Survey indicates that wage growth should decelerate from 4.3 per 
cent in 2024 to 3.6 per cent in 2025 and 2.7 per cent in 2026. This assessment is 
shared broadly among forecasters. Consensus Economics, for example, foresees a 
decline in wage growth by about one percentage point between 2024 and 2025.
Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continue to stand at around two 
per cent, despite an uptick at shorter horizons that may reflect the recent rise in energy 
prices. While the inflation expectations of firms have stabilised at three per cent across 
horizons, according to the SAFE, larger firms that are aware of the ECB's inflation 
target show convergence towards two per cent. Consumer inflation expectations have 
edged up recently, especially for the near term, which can at least be partly explained 
by their higher sensitivity to the recent uptick in realised inflation. Inflation expectations 
of professionals – as captured by the latest vintages of the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters and Survey of Monetary Analysts – as well as market-based measures of 
inflation compensation have ticked up for the near term but, over longer horizons, 
remain stable at levels consistent with our medium-term target of two per cent.
Economic developments
On a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, the 2024 growth rate came in at 0.9 per 
cent, constituting a material improvement in momentum relative to the 2023 growth rate 
of 0.1 per cent. While 2024 saw a modest recovery in consumption, investment 
remained weak and exporters continued to suffer competitiveness challenges. In terms 
of the quarterly profile, growth stagnated in the final quarter following a comparatively 
robust third quarter.
The incoming survey indicators suggest that the euro area economy is set to remain 
subdued in the near term. While unemployment remained low at 6.3 per cent in 
December, there has been some softening in labour demand, as reflected in lower 
vacancies and lower employment growth.
At the same time, our baseline assessment is that the conditions for a recovery remain 
in place. Higher incomes, lower interest rates and stronger household balance sheets 
should allow a faster pick-up in consumption. More affordable credit should also boost 
housing and business investment over time. Exports should also support the recovery 
as global demand rises, although this is highly conditional on developments in 
international trade policies.
Financial and monetary conditions
Global and euro area bond yields have increased significantly since our last meeting. 
Amongst other factors, the spillover impact of the rise in US and global longer-term 
rates has contributed to the steepening of the euro area yield curve.
Our past interest rate cuts are gradually making it less expensive for firms and 
households to borrow. The cost of borrowing for firms has declined by 92 basis points 
and mortgage rates have declined by 62 basis points since their peaks in autumn 2023. 
However, the interest rates on existing corporate and household loan books remain 

3/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
high, especially in real terms, with pre-2022 debt still re-pricing at higher rates as 
fixation periods expire.
In overall terms, financing conditions remain tight. While credit is expanding, lending to 
firms and households remains subdued relative to historical norms. Growth in bank 
lending to firms rose to 1.5 per cent in December. In part, the pick-up in December 
reflects firms substituting market-based long-term financing for bank-based borrowing 
amidst tightening market conditions and increasing upcoming redemptions of long-term 
corporate bonds. Overall external debt financing of firms increased by 1.9 per cent in 
December, but remained well below the historical average of 4.9 per cent.Loans to 2 
households continued to rise gradually, driven by mortgages, but remained muted 
overall, with an annual growth rate of 1.1 per cent in December, notably below the long-
term average of 4.2 per cent.
According to the latest bank lending survey, the demand for loans by firms increased 
slightly in the fourth quarter. At the same time, credit standards for loans to firms have 
tightened again, after having broadly stabilised over the previous four quarters. The 
renewed tightening of credit standards for firms was driven by the fact that banks see 
higher risks to the economic outlook and have lower tolerance for taking on credit risk. 
This finding is consistent with the results from the SAFE, in which firms reported a small 
decline in the availability of bank loans and more demanding non-rate lending 
conditions. In terms of households, the demand for mortgages increased strongly, 
mostly on the back of more attractive interest rates and better prospects for the property 
market. Credit standards for housing loans remained unchanged overall.
Risk assessment
Risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. In addition to trade policy 
uncertainty, lower confidence could prevent consumption and investment from 
recovering as fast as expected. This could be amplified by geopolitical risks, such as 
Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, which 
could disrupt energy supplies and further weigh on global trade. Growth could also be 
lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening last longer than expected. In the 
other direction, growth could be higher if easier financing conditions and falling inflation 
allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound faster.
We take a two-sided approach to assessing inflation risk. Inflation could turn out higher 
if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to inflation also stem 
from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and freight 
costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather 
events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by 
more than expected. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if low 
confidence and concerns about geopolitical events prevent consumption and 
investment from recovering as fast as expected, if monetary policy dampens demand 
by more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens 
unexpectedly. Greater friction in global trade would make the euro area inflation outlook 
more uncertain.
A middle path for monetary policy

4/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Taken together, the incoming data since our previous meeting meant that it was clear 
that we should take a further step in monetary easing by lowering the deposit facility 
rate to 2.75 per cent. By excessively dampening demand, the alternative of holding the 
deposit facility rate at the level of 3.0 per cent would not have been consistent with the 
set of rate paths that would best ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two 
per cent medium-term target. At the same time, the new level for the deposit facility rate 
at 2.75 per cent preserves considerable optionality in responding to shocks. In 
particular, the rate path can adjust as appropriate in the event of material upside or 
downside shocks to the inflation outlook and/or to economic momentum.
While our baseline is that inflation should decline from 2.5 per cent in January to around 
our target in the coming months, it is still important to take into account that this 
deceleration might take longer than expected and that new upside risks to inflation 
could emerge, including due to external developments. These considerations explain 
why we have taken a step-by-step approach to rate cutting since last June.
At the same time, an excessive abundance of caution in monetary easing could 
threaten the recovery in domestic demand that is needed to support the pricing 
environment compatible with our medium-term two per cent target. Under this too-
cautious path, a below-target inflation dynamic could take hold, which would then 
require a more sizeable policy response to ensure inflation returns to our symmetric two 
per cent medium-term target.
Balancing these considerations suggest a middle path is appropriate, which neither 
over-weighs upside risk nor over-weighs downside risk. That is, a robust monetary 
policy approach should balance the risks of moving too slowly against the risks of 
moving too quickly. Accordingly, it is prudent to maintain agility in adjusting the stance 
as appropriate on a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting basis and to not pre-
commit to any particular rate path.
In closing, let me comment on two much-discussed concepts: restrictiveness and 
neutrality.
When inflation is materially above target and requires a monetary response to ensure 
that it returns to target in a timely manner and that inflation expectations remain 
anchored, the monetary stance must be clearly restrictive. As inflation returns close to 
target, policymakers need to shift their focus to adjusting monetary policy in line with the 
incoming economic and financial data and the evolving risk assessment to deliver the 
two per cent target over the medium term. In other words, policymakers should deliver 
the monetary stance that is appropriate to the situation.
In exiting a restrictive phase, much energy could be diverted towards creating a 
summary "restrictiveness" index. Any such index would have to incorporate at least 
nine factors: (i) the still-important rolling off of super-cheap debt that was taken out in 
the "low for long" era that is now being re-financed at higher rates; (ii) in the other 
direction, the transmission of the easing since the peak of the hiking cycle; (iii) the 
impact of the anticipation of future rate cuts on current financing conditions; (iv) the 
evolving contribution of quasi-exogenous influences on financing conditions (such as 
global upward pressure on term premia); (v) the dynamics of bond and equity risk 
premia; (vi) the evolution of credit standards in bank lending; (vii) the different timelines 

5/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
for market-based and bank-based transmission; (viii) the responsiveness of 
consumption and investment to shifting monetary conditions; and (ix) the 
responsiveness of price setting to shifting monetary conditions.
All of these factors enter our calibration of monetary policy (our assessment of the 
strength of monetary policy transmission has been highlighted as central to our reaction 
function) and cannot be summarised by a single indicator such as comparing the 
prevailing policy rate to a highly-uncertain estimate of the so-called neutral rate.3
In terms of policy making, uncertainty about the level of the neutral rate and, more 
generally, about the strength of monetary transmission inescapably sits alongside 
uncertainty about the inflation outlook and uncertainty about the economic outlook.
This is why our 2021 monetary policy strategy statement highlights that our decisions 
are based on an integrated assessment of all relevant factors. Over the last two years, 
we have emphasised in particular the importance of underlying inflation and the 
strength of monetary transmission as particularly relevant in complementing our 
analysis of the inflation outlook. More generally, it is essential that all relevant risks are 
incorporated in monetary policy decisions.

3 The neutral rate is an important concept in understanding the likely long-run average 
interest rate but it is not a good guide to near-term policy decisions. A team of ECB 
economists will release an updated assessment of the neutral rate for the euro area on 
Friday.
