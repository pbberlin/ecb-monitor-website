Gabriel Makhlouf: Remarks at the EU Heads of Mission Meeting
Remarks by Mr Gabriel Makhlouf, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, at the EU 
Heads of Mission Meeting (HOMS), Embassy of the Republic of Bulgaria in Ireland, 
Dublin, 22 January 2025.

Good afternoon everyone. It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to address you today. 
Thank you in particular to Ambassador Andreeva-Malakova for the invitation.  
Allow me to start by acknowledging your important work in navigating an increasingly 
complex international environment. Open dialogue and mutual respect have laid the 
groundwork for the meaningful cooperation at the core of our shared European project. 
It is also fundamental to the functioning of the broader international rules-based order 
that we have become familiar with over the last 80 years. And let me say, for the 
avoidance of doubt, that I remain a believer in the potential of international 
connectedness to strengthen communities rather than weakening them.
Ireland's track record is a testament to that. The first 50 years of independence are in 
stark contrast to the second 50: from isolated protectionism to being part of the largest 
single market in the world. 
Our economic success has not been linear but it has run in tandem with that of the rest 
of the EU. We know what happened following the financial crisis just over a decade 
ago. But our strong mutually beneficial relationship has ensured that Ireland remains a 
vital part of the European project, contributing to and benefitting from the stability and 
opportunities it affords. The relationship underscores the importance of continued 
collaboration and shared progress.
But it is also obvious that we are in another period of transition across the globe. 
Political leaderships are changing across Europe and across the Atlantic. We have a 
new European Commission and European Parliament, where half of the MEPs are 
newly elected.
This period of political change comes at a pivotal moment. The global geopolitical 
landscape faces significant strain and complexity, driven by competing interests, 
shifting alliances and increasingly independent economic blocs. The Russian war on 
Ukraine and its people threatens the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity 
that has underpinned the international order that was established 80 years ago. The 
conflicts in the Middle East and in Sudan are human tragedies that we have become 
uncomfortably familiar with.
Simultaneously, the rise of economic nationalism and trade disputes have created 
friction between major powers. Relationships appear to oscillate between competition 
and cooperation with resultant impacts on our individual and collective ability to tackle 
climate change, leverage the digital transformation and manage the march of 
demography.

2/3 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
These shifts present significant challenges for the EU. We have been a fervent 
advocate for free markets and global economic integration. But we now find ourselves 
needing to balance an open and dynamic economy with our own strategic 
independence.
That is further complicated by our competitive decline vis-à-vis our large global 
competitors. Mario Draghi has highlighted that China is leading the way in the 
development of clean technologies and the US on digitalisation. Since the start of the 
millennium, real disposable income has grown almost twice as much on a per capita 
basis in the US as it has in the EU. Enrico Letta argues that the Single Market's current 
framework is ill-equipped to navigate today's global challenges, particularly those posed 
by digitalisation and climate change.
Draghi and Letta both provide detailed recommendations on how to arrest Europe's 
malaise. Their recommendations deserve careful consideration and a response that is 
underpinned by a determination to strengthen Europe's unity, its competitiveness and 
its resilience.
A resilient financial system supports the efficient allocation of resources, facilitates 
investment and underpins trust in the broader economy. It is critical for maintaining 
economic stability, fostering growth and safeguarding public confidence. That means 
the Savings and Investments Union must deliver if Europe is to regain its competitive 
edge, and if we are to find ways to unlock the €11.5 trillion held by Europeans in 
deposits and cash and channel it to drive European innovation, while maintaining our 
resilience in the face of future potential shocks. As a strong advocate for a risk-based 
supervisory approach, the Central Bank of Ireland wants to ensure that the financial 
system remains resilient while serving the broader economy effectively. 
Together with our Eurosystem colleagues, our focus continues to remain on price 
stability and ensuring inflation stabilises sustainably at our 2 per cent medium term 
target. We will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach 
to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance for the Euro area.  In my view, 
the high levels of uncertainty in the global macrofinancial environment calls for 
prudence in our decision-making.  
Our single currency is of course at the heart of one of Europe's success stories. Last 
year, we celebrated its 25anniversary. The Euro has proven its resilience through a th 
series of political, economic and health crises. It continues to be a symbol of strength 
for the European project and one of its biggest success stories. And as we enter a new 
era of technological innovation, the development of a Digital Euro represents a logical 
and critical next step.
By ensuring public money is available in digital form, we can future-proof our monetary 
system while maintaining trust and inclusivity for all European citizens. The Digital Euro 
will reduce costs by making financial transactions cheaper. It will facilitate innovation 
and competition and it will increase the resilience of the European payments system.
Conclusion

3/3 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Last year, the Central Bank of Ireland established a dedicated office in Brussels to 
strengthen our capacity to engage effectively with EU Institutions, providing timely input 
into the policy-making process, sharing our supervisory experiences and navigating the 
EU's legislative framework. We want to be a proactive and effective voice within the EU, 
playing our part in growing Europe's prosperity. While there are indeed challenges 
ahead, there are also opportunities. By working together, as ambassadors, as policy 
makers, as regulators, as central banks, and by developing what someoneonce called 1 
a "dangerous unselfishness", we can shape a resilient and prosperous future for our 
Europe.
Thank you once again for the opportunity to speak with you today.
