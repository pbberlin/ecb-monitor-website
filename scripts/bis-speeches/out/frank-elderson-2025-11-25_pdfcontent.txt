SPEECH
Resilient banks through effective supervision: a
pillar of Europe’s competitiveness
Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of
the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the
ECB Forum on Banking Supervision 2025
Frankfurt, 14 November 2025
It is a pleasure to deliver the last keynote speech of this year’s banking supervision forum. Over the past
two days, we have discussed what resilience means in times of challenge, complexity and disruption –
and why resilience should be broad based.[ ] As the Chair mentioned yesterday morning, broad-based
resilience is about strong financials, but equally about operational resilience, sound governance and good
risk management. 
During this period of profound change, a debate on European competitiveness has emerged with full
force. Many are asking what the key impediments and main enablers might be for a more competitive
European economy. How can we tackle the former and improve the latter? And what role does the banking
sector play in shaping the competitiveness of the real economy?
The good news is that over the past decade, much has already been achieved to make banks more
resilient, and this resilience remains the indispensable foundation to support the real economy throughout
the economic cycle. I will therefore start by illustrating this very welcome healthy state of the banks under
our supervision.
At the same time, discussions about the complexities that are having an impact on European banks’
competitiveness have gained prominence. Today I would like to highlight how we are tackling undue
complexities in the regulatory and supervisory framework in order to help banks operate efficiently within a
predictable, proportionate and risk-based framework.
I will then illustrate how banks’ competitiveness crucially hinges on structural and macroeconomic factors
that will require a concerted effort from a wide range of stakeholders. In this way, Europe’s banking system
can be both innovative and strong, competitive and resilient. So, let me first start by looking at the
resilience I mentioned at the start.
Bank resilience is crucial to withstand shocks and support the
economy at all times
Resilient banks are a vital precondition for a thriving real economy. Why is this so?
1

Well-capitalised and resilient banks are better placed to channel funds from savers to borrowers to enable
businesses to innovate, households to buy homes and governments to finance public goods. Banks must
therefore be well regulated and supervised.[ ]
European banking supervision was established in 2014 in response to the global financial crisis and
subsequent European sovereign debt crisis. Now, almost to the day 11 years later, banks under our
supervision are significantly stronger. Thanks to regulatory guardrails, rigorous supervision and continued
improvements in banks’ risk management, the banking sector is now in a much better position to fulfil its
essential function of supporting the economy at all times.
Today’s euro area banks have solid capitalisation levels, with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio
of 16% compared with 12.7% a decade ago.[ ]
Banks have robust liquidity positions well above regulatory requirements[ ] and the asset quality problems
that plagued many significant banks across Europe a decade ago have been successfully tackled. In fact
today the non-performing loans ratio stands at 1.9%, less than a third of the level observed ten years ago.

Moreover, euro area banks’ profitability has improved, with their return on equity now standing at 10.1%.
Encouragingly, stronger profitability is increasingly reflected in the higher valuations investors attribute to
euro area banks, as shown by a price-to-book value of over 1.

In addition to financial resilience, euro area banks have also improved their risk management and
governance[ ], and boosted their operational resilience[ ].
Thanks to broad-based resilience banks have been an anchor of stability in undeniably challenging times.
In the past five years alone, we have dealt with the worst pandemic since the 1920s, the most devastating
war on European soil since the 1940s, and the biggest energy shock and rise in inflation since the 1970s.
Moreover, we are now seeing tariff levels and “beggar-thy-neighbour” trade policies reminiscent of the
1930s and a resurgence of great power rivalry similar to the Cold War of the 1950s, all while the climate
and nature crises are getting worse.
Against this backdrop of change and complexity, the euro area banking system has fared well. Banks
remained resilient and did not propagate shocks.. And this is no coincidence: well-capitalised and resilient
banks do not excessively retreat in downturns, propagating adverse dynamics; instead, they continue to
support the economy.[ ] Think about what happened during the pandemic: banks continued to supply
credit to struggling businesses and households, even in the direst of circumstances. Better capitalisation
therefore makes the banking sector more resilient and better able to fund the real economy in good as well
as bad times.[ ] Fiscal and monetary support to households and firms clearly helped to shield the banks
from higher credit losses.
So resilient banks yield a double dividend: not only are they safer and hence better able to withstand
shocks, but they are also better able to continue playing their vital role of supporting the economy at all

times. In that sense, resilient banks play an important role in contributing to competitiveness, especially in
a bank-based economy like Europe.
Resilience must not, however, lead to complacency in an environment that continues to be complex and,
in certain aspects, is becoming increasingly challenging. Geopolitical tensions are not expected to
subside, ever more frequent and severe cyberattacks are here to stay, and the substantial growth of non-
bank financial institutions, including their interconnectedness with the banking sector, demand our
continued vigilance.[ ]
Reducing undue complexities, overlaps and costs that may hinder
competitiveness
At the same time we hear voices loud and clear about undue complexities in the regulatory and
supervisory framework that may negatively impact banks’ competitiveness.
Looking at how the regulatory and supervisory framework evolved since the start of the banking union
there is undoubtedly an increase in size but also complexity which is shaped by several factors.
A root cause of this complexity lies in the persistent fragmentation of rules at national level. Many facets of
the current prudential framework, for example, do not actually consist of a single European regulation but
of a patchwork of nationally transposed directives that create complexity. In addition, foundational
elements of the prudential framework, such as accounting standards, securities and insolvency laws,
continue to differ across Member States, which also adds unnecessary complexity.
Another root cause of this increasing complexity is that regulation and supervision have developed in
lockstep with the complexity of the external environment in which the banks under our supervision
operate. For example, the framework has evolved to make sure banks are operationally resilient, for
instance, to ever more frequent and severe cyberattacks and operational failures.[ ]And while this was
very much warranted in light of a more complex external risk landscape, it has also led to regulation
growing in size.
At the same time there is also a need to identify areas of unwarranted complexity, overlaps and
unnecessarily prescriptive elements that may have built up over the past decade and which can and must
be simplified.
Against this backdrop, we welcome the debate on simplification. The ECB’s Governing Council has
created a High-Level Task Force on Simplification to develop proposals to simplify the European
prudential regulatory, supervisory and reporting framework, while still maintaining resilience. The Task
Force plans to deliver its proposals for simplification to the Governing Council by the end of the year, after
which they will be presented to the European Commission.
As far as European banking supervision is concerned, we have been taking action for quite a few years
now. Let me outline some of the initiatives that are already in full swing to make supervision more efficient,
more transparent and more risk-based, without sacrificing resilience. This makes sure that we keep banks
resilient in an efficient and effective manner, thereby reducing cost factors that may hamper
10

competitiveness. We are proving that simplification and resilience are not opposing forces – they can go
very well hand in hand. 
The comprehensive reform of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) that we embarked
upon in 2022 is at the heart of our simplification initiatives. We have embraced risk-based supervision
through initiatives like the risk tolerance framework and a multi-year approach, which allow our supervisory
teams to focus more effectively on the underlying risks that matter the most. Practically speaking, this
means that we are not looking every year at every risk in every bank.
The SREP reform is already delivering results: SREP decisions have become shorter and more focused,
with SREP measures decreasing from 700 in 2021 to below 400 in 2025, with a stronger emphasis on
addressing severe findings.[ ] Moreover, issuing decisions by the end of October rather than the end of
December means that key findings can be communicated more promptly. We are also enhancing our
supervisory planning by improving the alignment of different supervisory activities, which helps banks to
avoid duplicating their efforts.
In addition, we are reducing undue complexities and prescriptiveness by streamlining our supervisory
processes through our “next-level supervision” project, which covers areas such as decision-making
processes, internal models, stress testing, capital-related decisions, reporting and on-site inspections.[ ]
One concrete example is fit and proper assessments, where, thanks to the help of machine learning and
technology, we have reduced processing times so that banks receive faster responses.[ ]
Another example is a , which was tested in the first half of
2025. This new process will cut approval times from three months to just ten working days.
An additional concrete simplification initiative is our drive to reduce reporting costs by establishing an
integrated reporting framework that is accessible to statistical, prudential and resolution authorities.
We are also further embracing proportionality, which, although already embedded in the European
regulatory and supervisory system, can be expanded further. Currently, 
, which are banks that meet clear criteria for size, simplicity and limited trading activity, already
benefit from lighter reporting templates and simplified liquidity and market risk standards, as well as
streamlined recovery and resolution planning.[ ] In practice, this means they are only required to report
up to 30% of the data that large banks must report. They also benefit from less frequent on-site
inspections. Therefore the SNCI regime seems the natural starting point to further enhance proportionality.
For instance, one could consider a more systematic application of this regime, as well as an increased
scope. These steps could be taken while maintaining the Single Rulebook, which ensures the risk-based
nature of the prudential framework is retained for all banks. This is important, because proportionality
should not be mistaken for simply reducing prudential standards for all smaller banks, irrespective of the
risks this would generate. Instead, we should focus our attention on initiatives that reduce undue
complexity, prescriptiveness and cost factors, without making banks less safe or causing them to lose
track of the underlying risks.

In addition, while maintaining the current level of financial resilience among supervised banks, there is
room to increase the predictability of how our supervisory assessments feed through to banks’ capital
requirements. This enhanced predictability would help banks’ capital planning. Moreover, the risk-based
capital stack in the EU is admittedly complex. With up to nine different layers of requirements and buffers,
each serving a specific purpose that needs to be met with going and gone-concern funding instruments,
the system can be difficult to navigate and, at times, create unintended interactions.[ ] Thus there seems
to be room to make the framework simpler and more transparent while maintaining resilience.
Banking sector competitiveness is shaped by multiple factors
Reducing undue complexities in regulation, supervision and reporting that may hamper banks’
competitiveness is essential. However the ability of euro area banks to compete with other actors –
especially their international peers – is primarily shaped by a broad range of other factors, many of which
are structural as well as macroeconomic in nature.
This becomes particularly clear when looking more closely at the profitability gap between euro area and
US banks.[ ] European banks, for instance, have a smaller home market and lower IT investments. US
banks are more concentrated, with the largest ones operating across the entire country, which allows them
to exert more pricing power and reap the benefits of economies of scale. European banks, on the other
hand, do not have access to the same benefits because the Single Market is still fragmented.
Moreover, business volumes and profitability crucially depend on a dynamic real economy. As the Draghi
report[ ] convincingly shows, real GDP growth in the EU has been subdued in comparison with US
growth over the last decade. And the robust economic growth in the United States, partly fuelled by its
more advanced capital markets, has provided substantial benefits to banks. Thus, improvements in
European banks’ competitiveness crucially hinge on revitalising growth in the European economy.[ ]
Another factor shaping banks’ competitiveness is operating efficiency. Although euro area banks’
cost/income ratio has improved from 66% to 54% between 2020 and 2025, since 2021 this has been
entirely driven by increasing revenues most notably net interest income, showing that there is still room for
improvement when it comes to banks’ cost base.

Boosting bank competitiveness by deepening integration and
revitalising growth
Considering the myriad factors shaping European banks’ competitiveness and the fact that many of these
factors have structural and macroeconomic root causes, real progress requires a concerted effort by a
wide range of stakeholders. Let me outline some of the potential avenues that can sustainably move the
dial when it comes to banks’ competitiveness.
One promising path for euro area banks to improve their operating efficiency is to enable them to reap the
benefits of economies of scale by consolidating the highly fragmented sector. Larger, pan-European banks
would also be better equipped to diversify risks, invest in digital transformation and compete in higher-
margin, fee-based business areas. Such developments would not only strengthen banks’ competitiveness
but also enable them to operate more effectively in the most profitable segments of the financial market,
improve their profitability and optimise their liquidity management at the group level. From a supervisory
perspective, we have repeatedly stressed that we see the benefits of cross-border mergers and have been
crystal clear that we will not obstruct consolidation efforts, provided that the limitative set of regulatory

effect”) to these changes. Lower values indicate an improvement in cost efficiency.

criteria are met. These criteria essentially ensure that a merger results in the formation of a safe and
sound bank.
At the same time, the ability of euro area banks to build pan-European business models and scale up their
activity is additionally constrained by the fact that the banking union is incomplete. Completing it, including
by establishing a European deposit insurance scheme, would help eliminate barriers that still hinder
market integration and ensure that euro area banks can scale up and diversify geographically more easily.
Some financial instruments can also play a meaningful role in transferring risks away from credit
institutions so that they are better positioned to meet additional lending demands from the real economy,
while creating opportunities for financial market investors. As noted in the recently published 
, the proposed regulations are a step in the right direction to make further
progress at EU level to achieve economies of scale in the development of securitisation products, facilitate
the expansion of the market, and support the integration of EU markets, all of which would broadly support
the savings and investments union.
However, further integrating banking markets alone is no silver bullet for the competitiveness challenge
banks are facing.
Looking at the real economy, the Draghi report shows that the widening GDP gap between the EU and the
United States is primarily driven by weaker productivity growth in Europe. And when it comes to
productivity, economists largely agree that one key reason for the gap is that Europe is adopting digital
technologies more slowly and is unable to fully capture the efficiency gains of the digital transformation.
Many firms remain behind the technological frontier.[ ] In order to catch up, these firms need access to
risk capital and to investors with networks and experience – which is why finalising the savings and
investments union is vitally important for more efficient and more integrated capital markets.
Beyond capital market integration, the broader lack of a true Single Market further amplifies Europe’s
competitiveness challenge. As I mentioned in a speech earlier this year[ ],internal barriers to the Single
Market are, on average, equivalent to a tariff of 44% on goods and a staggering 110% on services. And
soberingly, 60% of barriers to trade in services are still the same as they were 20 years ago. So in order to
boost productivity, unlock competitiveness and promote simplification, a time-limited roadmap to complete
the Single Market is more important than ever. In areas where full harmonisation is currently politically or
technically unfeasible, alternative approaches, such as introducing a “28th regime”, could provide a
practical and effective interim step.
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Europe stands at an important crossroads: to become a bulwark against external threats, ensure our
strategic autonomy, and remain masters of our own destiny with good living standards for all Europeans,
our economic prosperity is more important than ever.

And to safeguard our prosperity, we must bolster our competitiveness to ensure Europe is a place where
innovators, creators and doers seek opportunity in the world’s second largest market. And if we are to
succeed, a concerted effort from a wide range of stakeholders is essential.
Resilient banks have an important role to play. Banks that are innovative, strong and at the service of firms
and citizens at all times, are an essential pillar of a competitive real economy.
And as supervisors, our single most important contribution is to make sure that banks continue to fulfil this
role. Our job description is clear: maintain the public good that is financial stability. Because history has
taught us – often in the hardest way during crises – that without financial stability, growth falters, progress
fades, potential flounders, investment stalls, innovation slows and confidence slips away. But with the solid
bedrock of financial stability, there is no ceiling to the innovation, progress and prosperity we can unleash.
Thank you for your attention.

The traditional microprudential regulation of banks operates on a well-established logic. Banks finance
themselves with high leverage, partly through insured deposits, which play a crucial role in preventing
destabilising bank runs (see Diamond, D. W., & Dybvig, P. H. (1983). Bank runs, deposit insurance, and
liquidity. Journal of political economy, 91(3), 401-419)). However, high leverage and deposit insurance
also creates moral hazard: it incentivises bank managers to take on excessive risks, knowing that potential
losses would be absorbed by creditors and taxpayers rather than the bank itself. The primary objective of
capital regulation is to counteract this moral hazard by compelling banks to internalise potential losses.
Another convincing explanation of the rationale of prudential supervision was outlined in the seminal book
by Dewatripont, M. and Tirole, J. (1994), The Prudential Regulation of Banks, which states that
supervisors’ task is to monitor banks to ensure they are safe and sound on behalf of depositors, as the
latter are too small, dispersed and have neither the time nor the expertise required to understand the risks
a bank is taking. That’s why supervisory authorities are assigned the task of ensuring financial stability.
Moreover, after the great financial crisis, a credible and effective resolution framework to resolve failing
banks in an orderly manner has been a key innovation to increase trust, protect taxpayers’ money and
preserve financial stability.

For example, we reduced the average processing time from 109 days in 2023 to 97 days in 2024, and to
as little as 61 days for non-complex cases, meaning that we can dedicate more time and resources to
complex cases in line with our risk-based approach. For certain appointments, such as renewals of
mandates, we will streamline the assessment process further.
