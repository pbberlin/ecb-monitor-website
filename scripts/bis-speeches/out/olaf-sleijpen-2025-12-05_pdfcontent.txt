Olaf Sleijpen: Awakening Europe's inner animal - building a resilient 
and innovative economy

Sometimes, the trouble with an economy can be illustrated by an animal. Or rather, the 
absence of one. I mean, many countries have an animal as a national symbol. Ireland 
for example is often referred to as the Celtic tiger, symbolising its awakened economic 
power. The Dutch have the lion (no lack of self-confidence there). And the Americans 
the bald eagle. All impressive animals.
But what animal symbolises Europe? Some argue for the bull, and indeed I think it is 
displayed on all EU residence permits. But of course, there is a problem with that. 
Because as you know it refers to the story from Greek mythology, where the Phoenician 
princess Europa is abducted by Zeus, disguised as a bull. But in this story we are not 
the bull, we are the victim. And in a way that painfully illustrates how we Europeans 
sometimes fall into the role of a victim, when we could be taking matters into our own 
hands.
Now is the time to do exactly that: take matters in our own hands. And here perhaps we 
can take an example from Ireland. Two years ago, my predecessor was here in Dublin 
to give the Whitaker lecture. In his lecture he recalled how, back in 1958, Thomas 
Kenneth Whitaker initiated the Programme for Economic Expansion. This policy 
program opened up the Irish economy to foreign investment and industrial 
development. Ireland joined the EU, and ended its dependence on agriculture and 
tariffs. It was the start of a remarkable episode of economic development. The Celtic 
tiger had awakened.
Today, the European economy stands at a crossroads not unsimilar to the one your 
country faced almost 70 years ago. The European economy is not doing exactly badly, 
but we could and should do much better. Our productivity growth is too low. And that 
makes it particularly difficult to deal with the challenges of our time. As outlined in the 
Draghi report, the EU must unlock an estimated €800 billion in annual investments to 
meet its ambitions for climate, digitalisation, defence and innovation.
The root of the problem is threefold.
First of all, we still do not have one European economy. Substantial trade barriers 
between the EU member states persist. According to IMF research, productivity in the 
EU could increase substantially if trade barriers were to be reduced to the level 
observed among US states.
Second, our financial markets are highly fragmented and do not deliver sufficient risk 
capital for new innovative firms to grow. As we all know, European financial services 
are heavily bank-based. But banks are less well suited for financing innovation. In 
particular, there is a strong need for venture capital to enable innovative firms to grow

beyond the initial start-up phase. As recently shown by the ECB, the availability of 
venture capital in the US is three times higher than in Europe, with the gap widening 
over time.
Third, the EU budget is still focused on the economy of the past, and not so much on 
providing the public goods that are necessary for the economy of the future. Agricultural 
subsidies and cohesion funds together account for more than two thirds of the EU 
budget, while expenditures on research, climate, defence and cross-border 
infrastructure remain low.
That is where we stand today. If we want a modern, innovative and productive 
European economy that is ready for tomorrow's challenges, we need to change course. 
Like Ireland did in the 1960s.
Basically, we have to do three things.
First of all, we need to deepen the European Single Market, by addressing cross-border 
barriers, introducing more harmonised rules, and curbing national state aid policies that 
hinder innovation.
Addressing cross-border infrastructural barriers, both digital and physical, may require 
additional public investment, because this generally concerns public goods. Such 
investments may benefit from coordination at the EU level. I will come back to that in a 
minute.
To further harmonise rules, the EU needs to limit the possibility for 'gold plating' by 
Member States, by opting more for regulations rather than directives.
On state aid rules, there has been a progressive relaxation in response to recent crises. 
While national state aid was understandable and sometimes effective under the 
circumstances, it has also distorted the level playing field. Therefore, the European 
Commission should strictly enforce regulation of state aid at the national level. Instead, 
it should provide European state aid in a targeted way, and solely when it is clearly 
justified.
Capital markets are one area where deepening of the single market is particularly 
necessary. This is my second action point. Promoting the Savings and Investment 
Union is key here. We need to enlarge the pools of capital available for investment by 
stimulating households to invest more of their money rather than putting all of it in 
saving accounts. Pension reforms can also help here. Therefore I welcome the 
proposals by the European Commission, announced last week, to stimulate the build-up 
of supplementary pension provisions. And maybe Ireland and my own country can 
guide other partners in this respect. Furthermore, we need to make sure these pools of 
capital are invested more in equity, including venture capital, by taking down cross-
border barriers. The SIU strategy recently presented by the European Commission is 
aimed at achieving precisely that.
Let me elaborate a bit on the issue of venture capital. Over the past years the EU has 
tried to stimulate venture capital. We can and should build further on that. We could 
streamline the registration process for the European venture capital label to encourage

more funds to participate. We could expand the European Innovation Council's equity 
co-financing model by introducing guarantees on investments. This could also be 
considered under other public programmes supporting venture capital investment, such 
as by the European Investment Fund, the European Investment Bank, as well as 
national initiatives. And we could reduce cross-border barriers in the field of tax 
procedures, insolvency proceedings and corporate governance. This could be 
combined with simplified reporting and compliance mechanisms.
I realise this is quite a list. Integrating our capital markets is a big task. But on the sunny 
side, the upward potential is also huge. If we manage to rise to the occasion, Europe 
could truly become an Innovation Union as well.
The third area where we can and must improve, is by spending taxpayers' money 
through the EU budget more strategically. The next Multiannual Financial Framework, 
due in 2027, should be modernised, with a redirection of funds towards the provision of 
European public goods catering for Europe's future. Those are goods and services that 
are more effectively provided by the government than the market, and that are more 
effectively provided at the EU level than at the national level.
There are several ways of doing this, for instance by redirecting current spending 
priorities. This is ultimately a political decision. Some argue in favour of the issuance of 
common EU debt to finance the EU's new priorities. However, if we do that, this should 
be accompanied by a reduction in national debt levels to ensure that total public debt 
remains sustainable. Because ultimately, the national and European taxpayer is one 
and the same person. Moreover, while acknowledging the diversity of the public 
finances at national level in the EU, the average debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro area is 
high, and should be reduced. It is of utmost importance from a monetary and financial 
stability point of view that public finances in the euro area remain sustainable.
So to sum it up for you: deepening the Single Market, building a true Savings and 
Investment Union, and modernising the EU budget. That is the way forward.
I am wrapping up. Sometimes we Europeans are too pessimistic about our future. 
Instead of acting like a victim, we should take ownership and start building on our own 
strengths. We have tremendous potential. The EU is the world's second largest 
economy. And in a world where everything seems uncertain and money seems to be 
able to buy anything, we have strong institutions governed by the rule of law. This is a 
strength not to be underestimated. We should build on this strength by making the 
European economy more integrated, more productive and more innovative.
This also calls for the selection of an animal to symbolise the European Union. And 
please, don't let it be some non-existent animal designed by a committee. My proposal: 
an octopus. First, octopuses are among the most intelligent animals on earth. 
Moreover, they are remarkably resilient, as they are able to regenerate, which aligns 
with Europe's repeated recoveries across history. Also, few animals are more 
adaptable. And finally, when it comes to creative intelligence and ingenuity, the octopus 
is nearly unmatched in the animal kingdom, reflecting the need for innovation. And if 
you are not convinced yet, watch the Oscar-winning documentary "My Octopus 
Teacher".

Indeed, intelligent policies we need, like the ones initiated by Ireland in the 1960s. And 
as we are now talking about 27 countries instead of one, we also need a renewed 
sense of European purpose and unity. Being only a simple central banker, I am 
somewhat reluctant to quote famous writers beyond my level of understanding. But I 
could not help thinking of the famous line by Oscar Wilde: "Life imitates Art far more 
than Art imitates Life." He wrote this to remind us that what we imagine together can 
become the world we wake up to. So let the art of our work, even that of central 
bankers, be something worth imitating. And the Europe we shape today will define the 
Europe we live in tomorrow.
