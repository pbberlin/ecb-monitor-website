Ladies and Gentlemen,  
I am delighted to welcome you to the Banque de France for this fifth annual 
Fintech Forum, organised jointly by the ACPR and AMF. I would like to extend 
a warm welcome to Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, Chair of the AMF, and to thank 
Clara Chappaz, Secretary of State for Artificial Intelligence and Digital 
Technologies, for her presence at the close of this morning's proceedings. We 
created this Forum with a simple aim: to show that the Banque de France, and 
our Authorities, are as much those of the fintechs as they are of the incumbent 
players, and that innovation and regulation do not necessarily constitute an odd 
couple.  
Today I would like to illustrate this with a continuity, a break with the past, and 
a challenge. First, the continuity: while the first few m onths of 2024 have 
witnessed a stabilisation of the amount of funds raised, the ACPR and the 
Banque de France remain resolutely committed to fintechs  (I). The break with 
the past concerns the surge in artificial intelligence: t he ACPR stands ready to 
assume the role of “market supervisor” for the French financial sector (II). Lastly, 
the challenge is one of balancing openness and trust: as from next January, 
DORA legislation will provide more trust – as well as more requirements (III). 
I. Continuity: the commitment of the Banque de France and the ACPR to 
the innovative ecosystem 
1. A stabilising financial environment 
After the heady years of 2021 and 2022, followed by a sharp downturn in 2023,i 
funds raised by French fintechs stabilised in the first half of 2024 at 
EUR 560 million, compared with EUR 568 million in the first half of 2023. ii 
Therefore France is still the EU's biggest market, ahead of Germany (nearly 
EUR 500 million), but continues to lag well behind the U nited Kingdom 
(EUR 1.3 billion). This stabilisation is due in particular to the shift in monetary 
policy: the last increase in key rates was in September 2023, and since then we 
have cut rates twice by 25 basis points, in June and September, as a result of

the sharp fall in inflation. I will refrain from saying any more as we are in a “silent 
period”. 
The first half of the year may therefore mark a turning point and herald renewed 
growth in the fintech ecosystem. We are also witnessing this at the ACPR's 
Fintech Innovation Hub, with a distinct upturn in the number of new projects. By 
mid-September, 72 projects had been submitted, an increase of around 15% on 
the same period in 2023. 
2. The ACPR continues to listen closely to the ecosystem and intends to 
adapt to its developments 
Against a backdrop still fraught with economic uncertainty, the ACPR is listening 
ever more closely to the ecosystem. This is what the Fintech Forum is all about, 
together with the “My Fintech Journey” website, which is regularly enhanced to 
provide clear answers to the main questions posed by project leaders. It is also 
the purpose of our commitments under the Fintech Charter , and their regular 
monitoring.  
Our first contact response rate within two weeks – as outlined in the Charter – 
remains very high at 92%. Once the authorisation journey has actually begun, 
response times have edged up this year, averaging around 11 days (compared 
with 10 last year). The ACPR has also been very proactive around innovative 
projects in the broadest sense. In particular, I should mention the projects 
involving the first two issuers of stablecoins accredited in France –  and in 
Europe – on 1 July,
  the same day that the MiCA Re gulationiii came into force. 
We are also currently vetting applications for the pilot regime.iv 
Lastly, for f intechs that have already been granted authorisation and wish to 
extend their activities to other European countries, we are aware of the 
difficulties arising from the increasing number of sometimes relatively similar 
reports that need to be submitted to different authorities, and di ffering 
interpretations of regulations. These disparities are generating complexity and 
significant costs for start-ups like fintechs. And let me say loud and clear that it 
is time to take serious note of the call of the Draghi Report , among others, for

more standardisation and simplification. We fully intend to contribute to this 
process.  
II. A break with the past, around artificial intelligence   
1. One of the main drivers of fintech innovation 
Artificial intelligence (AI) – and especially generative AI – has clearly made 
exponential progress over the past two years. And despite massive interest, we 
have not yet c ollectively grasped the full extent of the transformation to come. 
Let's be humble enough to admit that we don't know everything, and that we 
don't really know what the business models of tomorrow will look like. But in the 
case of AI, if we wait until we are sure before innovating, we will be sure to get 
it wrong.  
As a central bank and financial supervisor, it is imperative that we keep up with 
these developments; and learning by doing is critical. At the Banque de France, 
we have already given priority to five use cases. At the beginning of May, I 
outlined an “AI doctrine”
v at the BIS, organised around three guiding principles: 
understand and master; buy- in, through a “human AI” that enhances human 
capabilities rather than replacing them; and cooperation between public 
authorities.  
2. The ACPR stands ready to take on the role of market supervisor 
In this regard, the European legislation adopted last June,
vi designed to promote 
trustworthy AI, will gradually enter into force. It identifies two “ high-risk” use 
cases in the banking and insurance sectors: systems designed to assess the 
creditworthiness of individuals or assign them a credit rating; and systems for 
assessing and pricing life and health insurance products.  
The ACPR stands ready to assume the role of market supervisor for the French 
financial sector. This designation seems only natural, in phase with both the 
spirit of the regulation that explicitly provides for such a role, and with what 
almost all of our European neighbours intend to do: the supervision of these 
systems can unlock significant and fairly obvious synergies with the prudential 

Page 4 of 5 
 
supervision of banks and insurers. And we have been preparing for this role for 
several years now, in liaison with the market vii and with the support of the 
Banque de France's Lab (our Open Innovation centre).  
So we have already acquired expertise, especially in auditing algorithms; 
however, we recognise that this role will require a certain methodological leap 
for the designated national authorities. Developing a standard European 
methodology would make sense in this regard, based on guidance from the 
European supervisory authorities, for example.  
III. The challenge: balancing openness with trust in the digital arena  
1. Open source, open data... new models to serve consumers 
New digital uses have resulted in new models that benefit consumers. Open 
source, open data, and so on: the desire for openness resides in the name. 
European regulation has helped to drive this dynamic, the second Payment 
Services Directive (PSD 2) being a prime example.
viii  
For financial services, this openness is set to intensify in the near future with the 
draft Financial Data Access regulation (FIDA).
ix A gradual approach to openness 
and data sharing – contingent on the degree of standardisation and digitisation 
– should enable existing players and fintechs to reach a consensus and jointly 
develop guidelines and technical arrang ements for sharing, while avoiding the 
risks of exclusion and demutuali sation. This should be done as part of 
“schemes”, outside of which data sharing should not be possible, and access to 
which should be restricted to entities established within the EU. It is in nobody's 
interest for openness to turn into anarchy, or to exacerbate cyber risks.  
2. In a more open world, more prone to cyber risk, a major componen t of 
systemic trust: DORA 
BigTechs have established a dominant position in the IT sphere in areas such 
as the cloud, to which the financial sector is increasingly turning.
x By the way, 
the ACPR has published just today a study on this topicxi and possible regulatory 
responses. Faced with these dominant players, fintechs are even more welcome 
as factors that “dilute” risks. Speaking more generally, it is obvious that cyber 

Page 5 of 5 
 
risks are growing in line with the increasing “ interconnectedness” of the digital 
sphere – and even more so with rising geopolitical tensions. 
The EU regulation concerning digital oper ational resilience for the financial 
sector (DORA), due to be applied from  next January, will enable the three 
European authorities to directly oversee all critical IT service providers. I would 
like to take this opportunity to welcome the recent appointment of Marc Andries, 
Inspector General of the Banque de France and a recognised expert in IT and 
cybersecurity, to head up this new mission. DORA will provide a major 
component of systemic trust thanks to a state- of-the-art regulatory framework. 
It bolsters third-party risk management and incident reporting for more effective 
cyber threat analysis, introduces mandatory penetration testing, and fosters a 
collective defence culture by enabling financial entities to exchange information 
on cyber threats within trust-based communities. DORA's rigorous standards 
provide a guarantee of the increased resilience it will bring to the financial sector. 
It is therefore particularly important that all those involved are well prepared and 
this afternoon's thematic workshop, run by teams from the ACPR and the AMF, 
will provide all those concerned with answers to any questions they may have.  
 ***  
I will conclude with a quote from Benjamin Franklin: “There are many ways not 
to succeed, but the surest way is never to take ri sks.” Fintechs know well how 
to take risks and in doing so, they also enable the financial sector as a whole to 
innovate and adapt to technological change. Nevertheless, dangers relating to 
these changes must be known and controlled, so we also need to for ge a 
successful alliance between innovators and regulators. You can count on our 
commitment to this objective. Thank you for your attention.
