1 Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen, 
We ﬁnd ourselves in very turbulent times: for Germany, for our European neigh‐
bours, and for the world, of which the United States of America is probably still
the leading nation. All of us, you and I, are constantly trying to process the
stream of news that we consider relevant.
If you have ever read the diaries of Thomas Mann, you will probably ﬁnd a com‐
pletely diﬀerent mindset. On 15 January 1954, he wrote: “Mid-month already.
Terrible.” Today, in mid-February 2025, I ﬁnd myself in wholehearted agreement
with the author Thomas Mann, who was born 150 years ago.
I will try to embody both mindsets: the mindset of an author, who is presumably
thinking about advancing his own plans, whilst also processing the stream of
news to pick up on longer-term trends that are relevant to relations between
Germany and the rest of the world. I hope that this ﬁts with the international
outlook that you very rightly put at the focus of the Union International Club.
The German economy in choppy internationalwaters
Speech at the Speaker’s Luncheon, Union International Club e. V.
1 Introduction
2 Development of trade
3 Current economic situation in Germany
4 Potential impact of US tariﬀs
5 Conclusion

I would like to discuss three topics today: the development of trade, the eco‐
nomic situation in Germany, and the possible impact of additional tariﬀs. I will
then revisit Thomas Mann and his mindset as I conclude.
2 Development of trade
I would like to begin by looking back to the past. Speciﬁcally, to 1970, when
global integration and, as a result, global trade were picking up pace. This pace
remained unusually high for almost 40 years. During this time, the volume of
global trade, measured in terms of global economic output, grew from 25 per
cent to 61 per cent.  Key drivers were lower transport costs, diminishing gov‐
ernment trade barriers such as tariﬀs and quotas, and new possibilities for infor‐
mation and communication.
Since the ﬁnancial crisis, the degree of interconnectedness in the global
economy has not risen any further.  It remains high, however, amounting to 58
per cent in 2023. Nevertheless, the trade policy climate has been deteriorating
noticeably for some years now. This began in 2018 with the escalation of the
bilateral trade conﬂict between the United States and China. It was then further
intensiﬁed by the coronavirus pandemic, which caused the number of trade
restrictions to surge in 2020. Of course, health considerations also played an
important role here at ﬁrst, too.
Since then, around 6,000 new trade-restricting measures have been adopted
worldwide each year. More recently, additional contributing factors have been
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine as well as rising geopolitical tensions.
Alongside trade restrictions in the stricter sense, subsidies also played a major
role. Protectionist measures have been implemented in many G20 (Group of 20)
countries.
Particularly noteworthy in this regard is China, which subsidises – in some cases,
signiﬁcantly – the production of industrial goods and thus undermines the level
playing ﬁeld. This was one factor that resulted in record exports: in 2024, China
exported over US (United States)$3.6 trillion worth of goods – more than any
country in history – representing an increase of almost 6 per cent over the previ‐
ous year.
[1]

This was not without consequence: more than one-third of the current anti-
dumping measures and compensatory tariﬀs that have been introduced around
the world since 2009 are aimed at China.  These are intended to restore a fair
competitive environment in the aﬀected markets.
For the German economy, developments in China’s economy have signiﬁcant
repercussions. Alongside technological advances, subsidies may have contrib‐
uted to Chinese companies taking market share away from their competitors in
certain sectors – both in China and abroad – and particularly in sectors in which
German companies had been especially successful until now: for example, in
machinery and the automotive industry. 
In the automotive industry, in particular, the ﬁgures speak clearly for China’s
growing strength. Between 2020 and 2024, China increased its net exports of
motor vehicles from just under 1 million to almost 6 million.  The German auto‐
motive industry bears substantial responsibility for the poor overall performance
of German exports to China in recent times. 
However, China is not the only reason why German exporters have lost consider‐
able market share since 2019. Since the start of the 2020s, the growth in
Germany’s exports has lagged behind the growth in Germany’s sales markets by
around 8 percentage points. According to the German Council of Economic
Experts, were global GDP (gross domestic product) to rise by 1 per cent, the
increase in Germany’s exports would now be only 0.6 per cent. Fourteen years
ago, this ﬁgure was 1.4 per cent.
This weakened position in the world has signiﬁcant repercussions for the
German economy. If Germany’s exports had kept pace with the expansion of its
international sales markets, the growth in the German economy between the
beginning of 2021 and mid-2024 would have been more than 2 percentage
points higher in real terms. 
If we look at the changing ﬂows of trade, then there are additional driving forces
alongside the obvious protectionism and the associated, far-reaching subsidies.
In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against
Ukraine, we have had to learn hard lessons on the importance of robust supply
chains.

Since then, policymakers and businesses have understandably stepped up their
eﬀorts to ensure that we in Europe can obtain necessary goods and services at
all times. Companies are examining the certainty of their deliveries from their
suppliers in the event of a crisis. Furthermore, the European Commission’s Open
Strategic Autonomy initiative aims, amongst other things, to reduce trade politi‐
cal and geoeconomic dependencies. 
The extent of this dependency, particularly with regard to critical imports from
China, was revealed by a representative survey of German ﬁrms conducted by
the Bundesbank last year.  This showed that there are considerable risks from
supply chain disruptions. However, individual sectors would be aﬀected very
diﬀerently.
According to the survey, nearly one out of every two ﬁrms in the manufacturing
sector directly or indirectly sourced essential intermediate inputs from China. In
addition, more than 80 per cent of these ﬁrms stated that it would be at least dif‐
ﬁcult to substitute these critical intermediate inputs. 
However, subsequent Bundesbank surveys show that ﬁrms are taking appropri‐
ate steps.  Nevertheless, changes in supply chains are associated with certain
increases in costs, which could reduce productivity. These changes should not be
allowed to lead to new concentration risks building up elsewhere. 
Another factor contributing to the weakness in Germany’s exports is the higher
costs of production, particularly the costs of energy.  According to ﬁgures from
the International Energy Agency (IEA (International Energy Agency)), between
2013 and 2023, electricity and gas prices for German industry rose by 30 per
cent and 55 per cent, respectively. By way of comparison, electricity prices in the
United States rose by just 18 per cent over the same period, and the price of gas
actually saw a minimal decline.
3 Current economic situation in Germany
So as you can see, Germany’s export industry is not in particularly good shape at
the moment. What is the economic situation like in Germany overall? I will now
turn to this topic in the second half of my speech.

Partly owing to the weak performance of Germany’s export industry, German
economic output declined for the second year in a row in 2024 – something that
has not happened since 2003. After price and calendar adjustment, the German
economy contracted by 0.2 per cent in 2024.
And the outlook for this year is not much better, either. In the Bundesbank’s
December Forecast for Germany, the experts are much more sceptical than last
summer; we are expecting only a small amount of growth in 2025. And things
are unlikely to improve noticeably until at least 2026.
This is due mainly to the extended period of weakness in industry. No wonder
investment remains low. But private consumption, too, is less dynamic. It is not
driving the expected recovery. 
As a central banker, I can at least conﬁrm that inﬂation has now fallen signiﬁ‐
cantly. And, despite all the uncertainty, the chances of returning to a rate of 2
per cent soon are good.
I have already mentioned that Germany will beneﬁt less from the growing global
markets than in previous years because of the deteriorating competitive posi‐
tion. How things will proceed is far from certain. The change of government in
the United States has not done anything to ease this uncertainty. And this brings
me to the third and ﬁnal topic of my speech – the potential impact of
US (United States) tariﬀs.
4 Potential impact of US (United States) tariﬀs
“Tariﬀ,” according to the new US (United States) President, “is the most beautiful
word in the dictionary.” Hardly a day goes by without him using it, thus fuelling
new speculation on the subject. 
Germany would be particularly strongly aﬀected by a new period of protection‐
ism in the United States. This is because we maintain close trade relations with
the US (United States). In absolute terms, we were by far the largest European
exporter to the United States in 2023. And we export a larger share of our total
exports to the United States than most other EU (European Union) Member
States.

The Bundesbank’s December 2024 forecast, which I mentioned a moment ago,
does not yet take into account potential protectionist measures by the new
US (United States) administration. That is because it is still unclear exactly what
form they might take. Of course, this does not mean we have been twiddling our
thumbs and are rushing blindly towards potential tariﬀ increases. Quite the
opposite: to accompany the December forecast, we analysed one possible sce‐
nario.  I would like to outline this brieﬂy for you now.
What exactly did we investigate? Our assumptions regarding tariﬀs were based
on Trump’s announcements from his election campaign; tariﬀs on imports from
China would rise to 60 per cent, while products from Germany and other coun‐
tries would be slapped with a 10 per cent tariﬀ rate.
As things stand today, the US (United States) government has already imposed
additional tariﬀs of 10 per cent on Chinese goods. Tariﬀs of 25 per cent on alu‐
minium and steel have been announced for March, while tariﬀs of the same
amount have been proposed against the country’s close trading partners Mexico
and Canada.
In addition to US (United States) tariﬀ increases, we factored in other announced
measures, including tax relief and the consequences of a mass deportation of
immigrants from the United States. We also assumed that the trading partners
of the United States would introduce retaliatory tariﬀs and that macroeconomic
uncertainty would increase in an environment such as this.
We used two diﬀerent models to estimate the macroeconomic impact of this
scenario for Germany. The ﬁrst model comprehensively captures global trade
relations. Meanwhile, the second model provides a detailed look at the German
economy. What were the results of our scenario calculations? 
The German economy would suﬀer considerably from such a policy shift. Both
models agree on this. Our heavy reliance on exports makes us particularly vul‐
nerable to dwindling foreign demand. Higher uncertainty presents an additional
impediment. A depreciating euro could improve price competitiveness. But that
would not be enough to compensate for the negative eﬀects. All in all, economic
output in 2027 would be almost 1.5 percentage points lower than projected.
[10]

By contrast, the eﬀects of inﬂation diﬀer signiﬁcantly in the models. While the
model tailored to Germany shows only minor eﬀects, the model that more
closely captures the global economy points to markedly higher inﬂation rates.
These diﬀerences mainly stem from the fact that the depreciation of the euro
and the retaliatory tariﬀs are passed through more quickly and more compre‐
hensively to consumer prices in the model that better captures the global
economy.
In the United States, too, protectionist measures are likely to have a marked
dampening eﬀect on economic activity. Losses in purchasing power and
increased costs for intermediate inputs outweigh any gains in competitiveness
for US (United States) industry. Inﬂation would rise sharply and could be even
higher still in the absence of any signiﬁcant monetary policy tightening. Contrary
to what the administration has announced, the tariﬀs would therefore have neg‐
ative repercussions for the United States. 
What can we take away from this? A drastic policy shift in the United States
would entail considerable risks to economic growth in Germany. It could also
fuel inﬂation, although it is very hard to say to what extent. However, we should
bear in mind that we are still talking about a hypothetical scenario at present.
Let us hope that it remains hypothetical and that trade policy uncertainty will
soon recede again. 
5 Conclusion
Ladies and gentlemen, 
At the start of my speech, I mentioned the 150-year-old “birthday boy” Thomas
Mann. Of course, the author is not famous for his discourse on protectionism.
But his writing contains repeated hints that international cooperation and cul‐
tural exchange are important ways of fostering peace and progress.
So if I could leave you with just one message today, it would be that protection‐
ism leads to welfare losses in all the countries concerned. There are no winners.
And it will be particularly damaging to the German economy, which is strongly
export-oriented. I will therefore continue to advocate for an open and rules-
based trading system.

The recently negotiated free trade agreement between the EU (European Union)
and the Mercosur countries shows that it still possible to take steps in the right
direction, even in turbulent times. Further agreements are intended to follow –
 and will hopefully not take 25 years to negotiate.
Trade is an important building block for prosperity. Wise economic policy is
another. Germany is currently facing a large number of structural challenges. We
are all responsible for tackling and overcoming them. This includes the next
Federal Government. 
Mid-month already? Terrible? Let’s roll up our sleeves. Then Germany’s listless
economy will also be reinvigorated. But ﬁrst I look forward to our discussion.
Thank you very much for your attention.
