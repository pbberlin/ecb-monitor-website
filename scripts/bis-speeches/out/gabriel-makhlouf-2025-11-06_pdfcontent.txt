Chair and Committee members, thank you for the invitation to join you today to discuss 
the issue of the Central Bank's role in the Israeli Bond Programme. I am joined by Mary 
Elizabeth McMunn, Deputy Governor, Financial Regulation, and Gerry Cross, Director 
of Capital Markets and Funds. 
Since our first engagement with you on this issue over a year ago, we have 
endeavoured to support your examination of it to the fullest.
The Central Bank's role in this issue is governed by EU law. The EU Prospectus 
Regulation sets out harmonised EU laws with respect to securities which are the 
subject of that regulation. This is a part of the EU Capital Markets Union. Each Member 
State of the EU must appoint a competent authority in that jurisdiction. The Central 
Bank has been appointed as the competent authority in Ireland for the purposes of the 
EU Prospectus Regulation and must carry out its functions and duties as provided for 
under that Regulation.
At all times, we have been obliged to carry out the statutory tasks and functions which 
have been assigned to us. We have to work within the law and we have carefully and 
comprehensively discharged our obligations under the EU Prospectus Regulation.
As set out in my recent letter to the Committee, there are a number of important over-
arching points that I would like to highlight, specifically the Central Bank's role in the 
transfer of approval process, our professional secrecy obligations, and the framework of 
EU Regulations within which we operate.
First, Article 20(8) of the EU Prospectus Regulation provides for the transfer of the 
approval of a prospectus on the request of an issuer to the competent authority of 
another Member State. Any such transfer is subject to prior notification to ESMA and 
the agreement of the competent authority to whom the approval function is to be 
transferred.
In this process, the competent authority of the home Member State only approves the 
transfer to the competent authority of another Member State but does not approve the 
prospectus that is issued. The competent authority of the transferee Member State 
reviews and decides whether to approve the prospectus.
In this framework, the Central Bank's role was limited to transferring the role of 
approving the 2025 Prospectus to the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur 
Financier in Luxembourg (the CSSF). The Central Bank did not have any role in the 
review or approval of the 2025 Prospectus and did not receive any draft of that

document. It was a matter for the CSSF to independently carry out the review and 
approval process.
There are two distinct and separate steps in the transfer of approval process. The first 
is the transfer of approval of the prospectus to another competent authority. The second 
is the review and approval of the prospectus by that other authority. In carrying out its 
role of reviewing and approving the relevant prospectus, the CSSF is entirely 
independent of the Central Bank.
Second, the Central Bank is subject to confidentiality obligations pursuant to the EU 
Prospectus Regulation and Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942. Those 
obligations restrict us from disclosing confidential information obtained in the 
performance of our functions. The correspondence between the Central Bank and the 
State of Israel and between the Central Bank and the CSSF also falls within 
confidentiality restrictions. Within our legal obligations, we have sought, to put as much 
information as possible with regard to this matter into the public domain.
Third, one of the functions that we are required to carry out under the Prospectus 
Regulation is to consider transfer of approval requests. When considering transfer of 
approval requests, we consider the connectivity of the prospectus with the jurisdiction 
from which and to which it is seeking a transfer.
In the case of the State of Israel transfer of approval request, the issuer decided that it 
would cease from 1 September 2025 making offers to the public under its prospectus in 
Ireland. The bonds to be issued under the 2025 Prospectus may only be offered to the 
public in Austria, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
In circumstances where the State of Israel proposed to discontinue offers to the public 
under its prospectus in Ireland, the Central Bank approved the transfer of approval of 
the prospectus under the EU Prospectus Regulation.
Finally, the Central Bank reviewed the recommendations in the report issued by this 
Committee in the context of its functions and with regard to the prospectus it approved 
for the State of Israel on 2 September 2024 which expired on 1 September 2025. 
However we had no role in the review and approval of the 2025 prospectus.
We are happy to take your questions.
