2024 World Savings Day
1924-2024: one hundred years of fostering a savings culture
Address by the Governor of Banca d’Italia
Fabio Panetta
Rome, 31 October 2024



Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
World Savings Day was established one hundred years ago, during the 
celebrations for the foundation of Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde.1 
Every year since then, this day has focused on the importance of saving.
Saving means transferring resources from the present to the future: people 
save in order to smooth consumption over the course of their lives; to handle 
unforeseen events such as job loss or illness; to pay for education, buy a house or 
start a business.
A person’s ability to save depends on their expected lifetime income, although 
the constraint of current earnings becomes stringent for those who, like many young 
people, struggle to access credit. The social protection system also plays an important 
role: a generous pension and an efficient healthcare system attenuate the need to set 
resources aside. Finally, saving decisions are based on wealth – that which we inherit 
and that which we plan to leave to our loved ones2 – and on expected returns.3 
Savings are an element of stability in the lives of households, yet they are also 
an important resource for business investment. 
Savings and economic and social progress are closely linked, as recognized by 
Article 47 of Italy’s Constitution, which states that ‘The Republic shall foster and 
protect savings in all forms’.
1 Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde was founded in 1823, but the international conference 
marking its 100th anniversary was postponed to 1924 for organizational reasons.
2 ‘[V]i sono […] uomini, fortunatamente i più, i quali, mossi da sentimenti diversi, hanno l’istinto della 
costruzione. […] Il padre non risparmia per sé; ma spera di creare qualcosa che assicuri nell’avvenire 
la vita della famiglia’, L. Einaudi, Lezioni di politica sociale, Turin, Einaudi, 2004 (c. 1949), p. 191 
(There are men who, driven by a wide range of different feelings, have an instinct for construction. 
The father does not save for his own benefit, but rather hopes to create something that will secure the 
wellbeing of his family in the future).
3 The higher the return the greater the incentive to save, thereby increasing opportunities for consumption 
in the future.

1. One hundred years of saving in Italy 
In 1924, when World Savings Day was established, Italians’ savings had 
bridged the gap with the other advanced economies, 4 thanks to the increase 
resulting from the economic growth of the Giolittian Era (1901-1914) and the 
sizeable remittances by Italian emigrants. 5 The stock of bank deposits and postal 
savings books amounted to 27 per cent of GDP.6 
Subsequent dramatic historical events – the Great Depression, the Second 
World War and post-war inflation – decimated the financial wealth of an entire 
generation: by 1948 the value of bank and postal deposits had plummeted to 10 
per cent of GDP. 
Those painful experiences sharpened the focus of society and of the newly 
established republican institutions on savings. The protection of savings was even 
enshrined in our Constitution, a rarity in the international landscape.7 
After the Second World War and up to the early 1990s, Italian households 
were saving one quarter of their income every year on average (Figure 1). 8  
4 According to the available statistical reconstructions, Italy’s gross national savings (including the public 
sector) stood at 9  per cent of GDP in the mid-1920s and, up until the eve of the Second World War, 
remained on average lower than in Germany and the United States, and higher than in the United Kingdom.

The drafters of the Constitution decided to include the safeguarding of savings in the Constitution, 
although they were aware of the risk that rules similar to Article 47 could turn it into ‘a memorandum 
and a list’ (Constituent Assembly, session of 19 May 1947, p. 4039). This decision is a testament to the 
deep wound that the severe monetary disasters of the previous 30 years had inflicted on our economic 
and social fabric and individual experiences.
8 This flow of savings does not include social security contributions, although in the perspective of 
the life-cycle theory originally put forward by Richard Brumberg and Franco Modigliani (and then 
extended by Modigliani and Albert Ando), they are indeed a form of saving, albeit involuntary. See 
A. Ando and F. Modigliani, ‘The “life cycle” hypothesis of saving: aggregate implications and tests’, 
American Economic Review, 53, 1, 1963, pp. 55-84.

The household saving rate began to decline in the 1980s; it then fell more rapidly 
after 1992, and eventually stabilized at 10 per cent in this century.9
There are several reasons behind this reduction in the propensity to save.
In the 1980s, the presence of a very generous public pension system was an 
important contributory factor. 
Later on, household saving was adversely affected by macroeconomic 
conditions. The 1992 currency crisis and the subsequent fiscal consolidation 
squeezed disposable income, leading households to save less in order to sustain 
consumption. On top of that, since the late 1990s, the fall in interest rates brought 
about by the introduction of the euro and better access to credit have favoured 
current over future consumption.
More recently, savings have been affected by the global financial crisis, the 
sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, and finally by the pandemic.
Demographic factors have also come into play. Population ageing has 
compounded the fall in the saving rate, with a rising share of elderly people drawing 
on their assets to fund their expenses, and therefore recording negative savings. 10 
The resources set aside by younger workers have been very limited, due to their 
low incomes.11 
9 The rise in the saving rate as a consequence of forced saving during the pandemic was the exception 
to this general trend.
10 In 1991, for each resident aged 65 or over, there were four people aged between 20 and 64; today 
that number has become two. For more details, see A. Brandolini and A. Rosolia, ‘Consumi, redditi, 
risparmi e benessere’, in A. Golini and A. Rosina (eds.), Il secolo degli anziani. Come cambierà 
l’Italia, Bologna, Il Mulino, 2011, pp. 137-158.
11 With less stable and low-paid jobs, young people are being limited in their ability to save, in spite of 
the stimulus to make precautionary savings to meet their needs during periods of unemployment. See 
A. Rosolia, ‘L’evoluzione delle retribuzioni in Italia tra il 1986 e il 2004 secondo i dati dell’archivio 
WHIP’, Politica economica, 2, 2010, pp. 179-201; A. Rosolia and R. Torrini, ‘The generation gap:  
a cohort analysis of earnings levels, dispersion and initial labor market conditions in Italy,  
1974-2014’, Banca d’Italia, Questioni di Economia e Finanza (Occasional Papers), 366, 2016.

But households are not the only savers: in this century, corporate savings have 
grown steadily, accounting for two thirds of private savings in the last decade 
(Figure 2).12 
Overall, the annual flow of private savings now exceeds €400 billion, or one fifth 
of national income. Only part of it, however, goes towards financing investments 
in Italy. In the five years before the pandemic, domestic financial resources spent 
abroad averaged 2.5 per cent of GDP. Had they been used to purchase capital 
goods, investments would have increased by almost one fifth.
2. A stable, growth-oriented economy 
Having a robust real economy is the first pillar in the protection of savings. 
A robust economy is one that grows and invests, generating jobs, income and 
opportunities to use savings profitably. By contrast, an economy vulnerable to 
shocks is prone to frequent recessions, which tend to slow the accumulation of 
savings.
The Italian economy has gone through difficult phases in this century. Between 
2000 and 2019, Italy’s real GDP per capita declined slightly, against an increase of 
25 per cent for the other European countries, although they too were losing ground 
to the United States.
I have already discussed this disappointing trend and its causes in past speeches: 
low innovation capacity and limited investment, a fragmented production system 
oriented towards traditional sectors, shortcomings in the public administration and 
in infrastructure, and low labour market participation.
The high level of public debt amplifies these weaknesses, exposing the 
economy to the vagaries of the markets and limiting our ability to react effectively 
12 Corporate savings consist mainly of retained earnings; national saving is the sum of private sector and 
general government savings, which is the balance between current revenue and current expenditure (not 
including capital expenditure, which instead contributes to the general government deficit or surplus).

to adverse circumstances. Interest expenditure absorbs considerable resources, 
which could otherwise go into funding education, infrastructure and healthcare.13
In recent years, the Italian economy has shown encouraging signs of 
improvement. After the crisis of the last decade, the production system has 
undergone a profound – and painful – overhaul. Firms have come out stronger.14 
These changes help explain how the Italian economy has been able to bounce 
back from recent shocks. Since the end of 2019, Italy’s GDP has grown by 5.5 per 
cent, against 4.1 per cent for France and 0.2 per cent for Germany.15 
The global economy is now in a phase of uncertainty and weakness. According 
to the latest IMF estimates, global GDP is expected to grow by just over 3 per cent  
in 2025, below the average for previous decades. The euro-area economy remains 
weak (Figure 3), partly owing to still high real interest rates and the end of the fiscal 
stimulus measures introduced in previous years. The Italian economy is suffering 
as a result.
However, it is the longer-term trends that are worrying: ongoing conflicts, the 
fragmentation of global trade, the division of countries into opposing blocs, and 
a continent, Europe, which is suffering the effects of population decline, lagging 
behind and losing influence in international relations.
In this context, the European Union and Italy stand in need of far-reaching reforms. 
Europe needs to revive the sense of common purpose that enabled the adoption 
of the NextGenerationEU programme and has since waned. The areas in which 
to take action are numerous: 16 we need to realize the full potential of the single 
market; launch joint projects in innovation and technology, starting with the 
13 As I noted recently, Italy is the only euro-area country where interest payments on public debt almost 
match spending on education; see F. Panetta, ‘If we are not after the essence, then what are we after?’, 
speech at the 45th Foundation Meeting for Friendship among Peoples, Rimini, 21 August 2024.

digital and green transitions; reduce foreign dependency in the energy and defence 
sectors; streamline rules and regulations; create a centralized and autonomous 
fiscal capacity; and address the demographic challenge.
Italy has an important responsibility in lending credibility to the European 
project, which it can fulfil by carrying out the investments and reforms laid out in 
the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, reducing the public debt-to-GDP ratio, 
and decisively tackling the unresolved issues I have mentioned. 
3. Monetary stability 
Monetary stability is the second pillar in the protection of savings. Inflation 
worsens the allocation of resources and erodes the real value of savings.17 
In its first two decades of existence, the monetary union ensured moderate 
inflation. The pandemic and the energy shock, however, changed this: in 2022, 
consumer prices grew by 10 per cent in the euro area and by 12 per cent in 
Italy.
The ECB’s monetary tightening actions helped bring inflation down as swiftly 
as it had risen: today, price growth stands at around 2 per cent for the first time since 
2021. The ECB has thus been able to cut its key interest rates in three consecutive 
Governing Council meetings since June. 
However, monetary conditions are still tight and new cuts will be necessary. 
As inflation subsides, our focus should be on the sluggishness of the real economy: 
without a sustained recovery, inflation risks being pushed well below the target, 
opening up a scenario that would be difficult for monetary policy to counteract and 
should therefore be avoided.
17 Tommaso Zerbi opened the Italian Constituent Assembly meeting of 19 May 1947, during which 
Article 47 of the Constitution was discussed and approved, recalling ‘the cry of millions and 
millions of small Italian savers, the tragedy – without exaggeration – of our entire generation of 
small savers, who in the last 30 years or so have seen the purchasing power of the lira fall to one 
one-hundred-and-fortieth of its value in 1913 or to one thirty-fifth of its value in the period between 
the First and the Second World War’ (see Constituent Assembly, session of 19 May 1947, p. 4025; 
only in Italian).

4. Financial stability 
Financial stability is the third pillar in the protection of savings. Financial 
crises pose a severe threat to savers because of the destruction of wealth they bring 
about.18
Banks
Over the previous decade, Italy’s banking system suffered the consequences 
of two recessions within a few years. Between 2008 and 2014, GDP fell by 9 
per cent, leading to an increase in business bankruptcies and unemployment. 19  
Non-performing loans rose to 10 per cent of total loans. Banks suffered sizeable 
losses, which in many cases resulted in outright banking crises. 
That is now a distant memory. The banking system is currently well capitalized 
and profitable. The stock market valuations of the main financial intermediaries 
exceed their book values (Figure 4), signalling investor confidence in banks’ ability 
to generate income in the future. 
These improvements reflect the efficiency gains achieved by financial 
intermediaries and the strengthening of prudential rules, as well as the favourable 
conditions of recent years.20
Public aid during the pandemic crisis, including the expansion of state 
guarantees on loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, played an important 
18 In Italy, the global financial crisis of 2007-09 led to a drop in equity prices of almost 70 per cent, 
followed by a slow and partial recovery. The sovereign debt crisis caused further losses, coupled with 
a sharp fall in house prices.
19 In that period, yearly bankruptcies doubled to more than 15,000; the unemployment rate rose by over 
6 percentage points, to 12.9 per cent. 
20 In recent years, the European financial system has been characterized by ample liquidity supply 
and rapidly rising interest rates. These market conditions have created a particularly favourable 
environment for banks’ profitability.

10
role. Now that the conditions allow it, the time has come to return to a system of 
guarantees based on ordinary criteria.21
Looking ahead, the high capital levels and the foreseeable reduction in 
profitability could push banks towards consolidation, including at cross-border 
level. Consolidation deals must be made by improving efficiency and creating 
strong, profitable intermediaries that can better serve the real economy.
Greater integration of the banking market at European level would increase the 
soundness of banks and allow them to operate in multiple countries, diversifying 
risks and strengthening the provision of services to households and firms. The 
banking union needs to be completed by establishing a European deposit guarantee 
scheme and improving the bank crisis management framework. 
Creating a European capital market is also necessary. The most important  
– though not the only – condition for achieving this goal is the introduction of a 
European safe asset,22 which is essential for the operation of financial markets.23
Non-bank financial intermediaries 
Non-bank intermediaries have become the main financial players, both 
globally and in the euro area. In Italy, banks continue to predominate, but non-bank 
intermediaries are growing rapidly (Figure 5). 
21 The draft budget law for 2025 reduces the ceiling for guarantees that can be issued by the Italian 
fund created to improve access to credit for SMEs from €200 billion to €160 billion. This ceiling 
was €225 billion in 2023. In the five-year period 2015-19, the total guarantees issued by the fund 
amounted to about €60 billion.
22 In addition to introducing a safe asset, we must draft a consolidated European law on finance, 
strengthen centralized supervision of non-bank financial intermediaries, and standardize corporate 
crisis management procedures; see F. Panetta, ‘Europe needs to think bigger to build its capital markets 
union’, The ECB Blog, 30 August 2023; and F. Panetta, ‘The Governor’s Concluding Remarks for 
2023’, Rome, 31 May 2024.
23 A European safe asset would allow for better pricing of financial products, such as corporate bonds 
and derivatives, encouraging their expansion; it would provide a form of collateral that could be used 
across all market segments, including for cross-border transactions; and it would serve as the basis for 
foreign central banks’ reserves in euros, strengthening the global role of our currency. 

10 11
Non-bank finance facilitates the diversification of savings and is a primary 
source of funding for innovative projects, but it can make the financial system 
more complex and risky. 
Banca d’Italia carries out in-depth supervision of about 650 non-bank 
intermediaries with diverse activities and risks. 24 However, strong supervision 
requires that national efforts be complemented by effective international cooperation. 
Interaction between different national regulatory and supervisory frameworks 
is necessary to oversee the activity of financial intermediaries operating on a  
cross-border basis. This is the case for foreign intermediaries providing financial 
services in Italy using the single European passport.25 This model offers advantages 
in terms of competition and freedom of choice for savers, but it assumes that 
supervision is highly effective everywhere, a condition that is not always met.
The supervisory rules and practices for non-bank intermediaries need to be 
strengthened and harmonized across countries. Banca d’Italia is working towards 
this goal at both European level and as part of the Financial Stability Board.
5. The role of Banca d’Italia in the protection of savings
The protection of savings does not end with the supervision of financial 
intermediaries. It is also about ensuring the smooth operation and integrity of the 
financial system as a whole.
This means working to improve people’s financial skills, 26 and hence their ability 
to make sound investment decisions. It means offering tools to uphold savers’ 
24 Banca d’Italia supervises insurance companies (89 at the end of 2023) through the Italian Insurance 
Supervisory Authority (IV ASS). Other non-bank operators supervised by Banca d’Italia include 
investment fund managers, investment firms, financial corporations providing loans, crowdfunding 
service providers, electronic money institutions and payment institutions. 
25 The single European passport allows financial intermediaries to freely provide their services in any 
EU country without the need to establish themselves on their territory. These intermediaries are 
supervised by their home country authority.
26 As part of its activities in the field of financial education, Banca d’Italia reaches more than 150,000 
people each year, including students, small business owners, and socially and economically vulnerable 
groups at high risk of financial exclusion. 

12
rights quickly and inexpensively. 27 It means protecting the financial system 
against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. 28 It means taking 
direct action to counter cyber risks to financial and market infrastructures and 
making sure that financial intermediaries put the necessary safeguards in place. 29  
It means ensuring the efficiency and security of the payment system, which is the 
backbone of the financial system. 30 
Banca d’Italia performs all these tasks, working with law enforcement and 
judicial authorities, as well as with other national and foreign supervisory and 
regulatory bodies.
*   *   *
27 Banca d’Italia reviewed 100,000 complaints from bank customers over the decade 2014-23. The 
Banking and Financial Ombudsman handled 210,000 complaints, with the assistance of Banca 
d’Italia’s staff. As a result of the latter and of our supervisory activities, more than €1 billion were 
returned to customers. The Insurance Ombudsman service will be rolled out over the next few 
months.
28 Banca d’Italia is responsible for anti-money laundering supervision of financial intermediaries, issues 
relevant regulations and is involved in setting national and international rules and standards. It carried 
out about 350 inspections and 1,300 interventions over 2019-23. The Financial Intelligence Unit for 
Italy (UIF), which works with staff and funding from Banca d’Italia, examines reports of alleged 
money laundering and terrorist financing (more than 150,000 suspicious transactions were reported in 
2023) and carries out its financial analysis.
29 At national level, Banca d’Italia fosters cooperation with various institutional players through its 
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-BI). Together with the Italian Banking Association 
(ABI), it chairs the Computer Emergency Response Team for the Italian financial sector (CERTFin). 
At European level, Banca d’Italia is a member of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European 
Financial Infrastructures (ECRB) and the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative 
(CIISI-EU) for sharing information and cyber intelligence across systemic financial structures.  
At national and European level, Banca d’Italia monitors cyber risks in order to strengthen the security 
and business continuity safeguards of intermediaries. It identifies minimum requirements and 
measures for information system management.
30 Banca d’Italia manages a large number of Italian and European payment infrastructures. For 
example, at European level, the Bank has been involved in the development and is responsible 
for the operational management of the Eurosystem’s market infrastructures, consisting of: the 
T2 system for the real-time gross settlement of large-value transactions in central bank money 
between financial institutions and with the central bank; the TARGET2-Securites (T2S) platform, 
which enables securities transactions in central bank money to be settled simultaneously based on 
the delivery versus payment principle; the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system 
for instant payment settlement, which has been processing transactions in Swedish krona, in 
addition to those in euros, since February 2024. The first two platforms are managed together 
with the central banks of Germany, France and Spain, while TIPS has been fully developed and 
is managed autonomously by Banca d’Italia. 

12 13
Saving means looking ahead, at times with uncertainty and concern, more often 
with confidence and optimism. Adam Smith wrote that ‘the principle which 
prompts to save, the desire of bettering our condition; a desire which [...] comes 
with us from the womb, and never leaves us till we go into the grave’.31 
Savings are a source of stability and progress for households, as well as an 
invaluable asset for the economic and civil advancement of a country. 
The protection of savings, enshrined in our Constitution, is at the heart of Banca 
d’Italia’s action. 
Yet it is crucial that all those who manage people’s savings operate with integrity 
and abide by the highest ethical and professional standards.
Only then can we ensure that savings continue to be a driver of prosperity and 
progress for current and future generations, making it possible to look ahead with 
foresight and peace of mind.
