Ladies and Gentlemen, 
I am honoured to take the floor here at the Atlantic Council, just a few blocks 
from Franklin Park and Lafayette Square. Washington’s geography reminds 
every passerby of the enduring bond between our two nations – a bond forged 
in shared struggles,  and anchored in common values. As the Marquis de 
Lafayette, “hero of the two worlds”,  once wrote to George Washington: 
“Humanity has won its batt le. Liberty now has a country.” F rom the very start, 
the cause of liberty has been one we have carried together, across the Atlantic, 
and I strongly wish it still is.  
Let me also remind you with gratitude that Dean Acheson ,i a transatlantic 
statesman who played a key role in the creation of the Atlantic Council, as well 
as the Marshall plan and the Bretton Woods institutions, was instrumental in the 
early steps of European integration. He viewed it as essential to a stable and 
prosperous Atlantic order, built on peace, democracy and market economy. He 
urged the French government to take the bold step leading to the Schuman 
Declaration of 9 May 19 50, and hence  laid one of the cornerstones of what 
would become the European Union. For him, as for many Americans, the EU 
was not designed to “screw the US”, on the contrary. Robert Schuman, at that 
time French Foreign Affairs Minister,  remains for me a figure of profound 
admiration: he embodied the spirit of Franco-German reconciliation – a legacy I 
feel personally connected to, having grown up like him in that very region where 
our two nations meet.  
Hence, I will highlight that the transatlantic partnership has been so far  strong 
and balanced, as no other worldwide (I). But the US trade policy shift will harm 
the global economy – starting at home (II). Lastly, I will trace out a path for a 
European moment, if we seize this opportunity (III).  
1.  Mutual gains across the Atlantic: a strong and balanced economic 
partnership 
1.1. A strong and balanced EU-US economic relationship

The United States and the EU  are the world ’s two largest economies, 
maintaining one of the largest bilateral economic relationships. While the EU 
runs a trade in goods surplus with the United States (USD 234 billion in 2023), 
the services deficit has widened substantially in the last years (USD 125 billion 
in 2023)ii. Net primary income flows i n favor of US firms  – mostly composed of 
investment income such as profits and asset returns – also offset the trade in 
goods surplus, ultimately leading to a balanced current account (USD 19 billion 
in 2023).  
 
The effective applied tariffs between the EU and the United States were close 
before recent developments, with the EU imposing a 3.95% tariff on US 
products, while the United States applied a 3.5% tariff on EU productsiii.

And let me remind here the obvious: value -added tax (VAT) is not a customs 
duty; it is levied on the final value of imported and domestically produced goods 
equally, like the sales tax in the US.  
European majority-owned affiliates directly employed an estimated 5.3 million 
US workers in 2023 iv. European -based investors play a crucial role in the 
strength of the US economy, representing close to 50% of all foreign holdings 
of US securities in 2023v.

For centuries, ideas have crossed the Atlantic alongside goods and capital.  
Today, this legacy lives on through an interconnected research ecosystem, with 
120,000 European researchers currently working in the United States, and 
countless institutional partnerships between universities, labs, and firms. 
2. The US policy shift on trade will harm the global economy – starting at 
home  
I don’t mean that the latest globalization wave was a fairy tale: it had its problems 
and its imbalances, both social and financial. But the current lose-lose game will 
obviously increase them, and in no way solve them.  The new measures 
announced as well as the increasing unpredictability, constitute a major negative 
shock to the global economy, but first and foremost to the US economy.  
According to convergent analyses by most US and international banks and 
yesterday by the IMF, the United States could suffer in 2025 from an average 
estimated loss of around one percentage point in annual growth and a similar -
sized rise in underlying inflation. There could even be a US recession, which 
was unthinkable three months ago. But bad news for the US is bad news for all, 
including for Europe. According to preliminary assessments, there could be a 
direct negative impact of at least a quarter of a percentage point to euro area 
GDP growth in 2025. The impact on inflation remains more uncertain but could 
be as a whole on the downside. Our baseline scenario for France and the euro 
area remains that of an exit from inflation – returning to our 2% target this year 
– without a recession. 
Financial markets reacted very negatively to these tr ade announcements with 
the very unusual combination of a sharp drop in US equity indexes, a rise in US 
long term bond yields, and a broad -based decline in the US dollar value. The 
economic uncertainty may possibly threaten financial stability . Such deeply 
disruptive effects would also result from attacks on the independence and 
credibility of central banks. Let me on this occasion express again my gratitude 
to Fed’s Chair Powell, who admirably shows how a central banker must behave.

Independent from politic al impatience, our monetary policies are also 
autonomous from one another across the Atlantic. This in no wa y precludes – I 
can assure you – a continuous, trusted, and indispensable dialogue, which is 
more necessary than ever for global financial stability. But this autonomy is 
precisely what allows each of us to fulfil our domestic price stability mandate. In 
Europe, this is made possible by one of the greatest institutional achievements 
of the 1990s: the creation of the euro. I was personally in Maastricht thirty-three 
years ago, and much more recently in Francfort last week, for our latest decision 
to cut interest rates. There is currently no inflationary risk in Europe, and we can 
now almost say: “mission accomplished” when it comes to bringing inflation back 
to our 2% target: the significant deceleration of wages is another proof thereof. 
It is therefore both fair and appropriate that, comp ared to the Federal Reserve 
or the Bank of England, the European Central Bank has started cutting rates 
earlier, faster, and likely further this year. While this supports activity in the short 
term, the key to strengthening European growth remains structural — through a 
broader mobilisation of our internal resources. 
3. Nurturing Europe’s inner strengths to match America’s best: a “3i ’s” 
strategy 
3.1 A path forward to preserve the mutually beneficial economic relationship  
Let us use the 90 -day pause to seriously talk. The least economically harmful 
option would be indeed to negotiate – a bold European proposal, zero -for-zero 
tariffs for industrial goods, is already on the table – and then de -escalate the 
situation rather than setting off a transatlantic spiral of tariff hikes. So far, 
Europeans have reacted in a remarkably united and calm manner. The 
European Commission has prepared a series of retaliatory measures  – in case 
they are unfortunately needed – but has deferred their application. 
Furthermore, Europe and the United States must still commit to a “pragmatic 
multilateralism”, focused on some practical themes of common interest,  
including, to name just a few , financial stability, cross -border payments and 
crypto-assets, cybersecurity, the fight against financial crime and the prevention

of extreme climate events. Let us  resolutely preserve and support  the 
multilateral institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, born and hosted in this 
great country – and city. 
3.2 Scaling up Europe: the 3i’s agenda 
If the current situation has a silver lining , it is to possibly usher the European 
moment: Europe, despite its limitations, as a ha ven of economic predictability 
and confidence, rule of law, social cohesion . But it will not happen without bold 
moves. We can already see clear signs of it with the impressive shift of the next 
German government. It is obvious on Defence, but let me focus today on 
Economy, as the other pillar. We need a “general mobilisation” focusing on three 
imperatives, 3 ‘i’s, taking the bes t of the impressive economic success of 
America, or if you prefer, size multiplied by muscle multiplied by speed. First, 
we need to integrate the single market more. This means making the most of  
its size – as large in GDP terms as the United States  – by removing internal 
barriers in several areas such as services and energy. We also need to invest 
better, giving priority to the most promising breakthrough innovations, and 
particularly those related to AI. To succeed, we need to build financial muscle 
through a genuine Savings and Investments Union (SIU ) fostering more our 
abundant private savings towards equity and venture capital. Finally, we need 
to innovate faster. Europe needs simplification: less bureaucracy, fewer 
procedures and shorter deadlin es. But simplification is not deregulation , the  
European approachvi will remain firm on the objectives, but be more nimble in 
design.  
And to successfully implement these three imperatives, we urgently need a 
binding, visible and not too distant calendar: such a calendar will mobilise all our 
political and economic forces, as did in the past the 1 January 1993 for the single 
market and the 1 January 1999 for the single currency. 
* 
Let me now conclude. The transatlantic partnership has always delivered more 
by combining  open markets with clear rules and shared trust. As the great 

Page 7 sur 8 
 
French writer Victor Hugo envisioned:vii "A day will come when there will be no 
other battlefields but markets opening to trade and minds. […] A day will come 
when these two great groups, the United States of America and the United 
States of Europe, will stand face to face, reaching out across th e seas, 
exchanging their products, their commerce, their industries, their arts, and their 
genius." That day, alas, has grown more distant in recent times, and the 
transatlantic sky has darkened considerably. But even in the storm, we must not 
lose sight of our long-term course. You, the American people, will decide what 
must be said and fought for on your side of the Atlantic , as loud and clear as 
necessary. As Europeans, our task is clear: to strengthe n our own side of the 
ocean: let us, in the very name of the Atlantic spirit, seize the European moment.
