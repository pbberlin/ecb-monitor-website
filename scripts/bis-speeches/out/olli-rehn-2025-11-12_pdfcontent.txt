Presentation accompanying the speech
Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Colleagues and Friends,
It's a real pleasure to be back at the Peterson Institute, a place that for decades has 
helped shape how we think about the world economy: fact-based, open-minded, and 
not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom.
We meet at a moment when geopolitics and protectionism are reshaping the global 
economy. We have entered an era that is .  less rules-based and more power-based
The international monetary system is becoming more fragmented, more contested, and 
more strategic.
Now, amid this turbulence, Europe has proven its. resilience
The euro rests on firm foundations: the rule of law, macroeconomic stability, and the 
world's second-largest integrated economy.
Despite the war in Ukraine, the energy shock, and the sharpest inflation surge in 
decades, Europe has come through remarkably well. Inflation has returned to target. 
Growth has stayed positive. And employment - perhaps most impressively - has held up 
throughout.
So yes - the European economy has shown remarkable resilience.
But - and this is the key "but" - resilience isas . Our growth is  not the same   dynamism
steady, but rather modest.
In short, Europe's problem is not survival - it's. We can deal with shocks.  momentum
But can we ? generate sustained, self-confident growth
That's . And that leads to my main message today: the real test
A stronger international role for the euro requires a stronger, more dynamic 
Europe. Both in security and in the economy.
The euro's global weight ultimately depends on the vitality of the economy behind it. 
That is why the path forward rests on three key priorities: Defence, Dynamism, and 
Digital Sovereignty.

2/3 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The first D is inevitably Defence - and security as an economic asset. Russia's war 
of aggression in Ukraine has reminded us, painfully, that security and economics are 
.inseparable
That's not just a military point. It's also an economic one.
Because defence spending, if done right, is also an investment in innovation, industry 
and resilience. It drives technological spillovers. And - crucially - it builds confidence in 
Europe's capacity to protect itself.
But this also brings a . financial opportunity
The need to fund common defence reinforces the case for common European 
- including joint bond issuance - that could pave the way to finally provide instruments 
the euro area with . a deep and liquid safe asset
That would help integrate our capital markets and give the euro a genuine benchmark - 
comparable to US Treasuries.
Thus, reinforcing defence is not only about security. It's about creating the fiscal and 
financial backbone to make the euro more credible globally.
The second D is - the engine of Europe's prosperity and the foundation of  Dynamism  
the euro's strength. The lesson is simple: a currency cannot be stronger than the 
economy it represents.
The Draghi report put it clearly: Europe must reignite growth through more investment, 
smarter regulation, and a renewed commitment to complete the Single Market - 
especially in and . services   capital
That is why - investing in productivity, completing the saving and  economic dynamism  
investment union, and enabling innovation - is essential.
So let me underline this point:
The euro's international role and Europe's economic dynamism are inseparable. 
One cannot exist without the other.
The third D is - perhaps the most strategic frontier of all. In that  Digital Sovereignty 
arena, Europe remains far too dependent on non-European platforms and payment 
systems.
At the same time, are spreading rapidly - aiming at  US dollar-backed stablecoins 
extending dollar dominance into digital finance.
Europe is not ignoring this shift. That's why theis important. digital euro 

3/3 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
It's not about hype or headlines. It's about ensuring that European citizens and firms 
have access to in the digital age - secure, inclusive legal tender   issued by the 
.central bank, backed by public trust
The digital euro will , not replace, cash. And it will ensure that money in  complement
Europe remains a , not a private monopoly. public good
In a world where ,. It's about ensuring  payment systems are geopolitical instruments
that Europe controls the backbone of its financial system. Today,sovereignty is digital   
.monetary sovereignty
Together, the three D's form a coherent strategy for a stronger Europe and a stronger 
. And all three support one another: requires a dynamic euro  a credible defence 
economy to fund it; benefits from digital innovation; and economic dynamism    digital 
, in turn, depends on both secure infrastructure and economic scale.sovereignty
Let me History shows that  such  conclude.   periods of monetary system transition 
as the breakdowns of the gold standard and Bretton Woods  have provoked financial

Dollar dominance is likely to persist for quite some time, but its unipolar hegemonic

The next evolution of the international monetary system is probably going to be a

sound rebalancing of the global monetary order.
Finally, let's recall that is inherently the future of the internationalmonetary system       
. Despite the current headwinds,linked to the general fate of multilateral cooperation
 the European Union will continue to defend the foundations of international 
in the US, in the Global South, cooperation – preferably together with our partners 
and beyond.
Thank you for your attention.
