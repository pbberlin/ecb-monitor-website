SPEECH
What Is special about climate-related and
environmental risks?
Introductory remarks by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive
Board of the ECB, at the Legal Conference organised by the
European Central Bank on “The incorporation of environmental
considerations in the supervision of prudential risks”
Frankfurt am Main, 5 September 2023
This year has been a record year in many respects. July was the world’s hottest ever month, seeing
the hottest day ever recorded, while ocean temperatures hit all-time highs. We have experienced
heatwaves, droughts, floods, gigantic hail and record low levels of sea ice formation in Antarctica.
Climate scientists attribute these records to human-made climate change, exacerbated by the arrival
of El Nifio.
Not only do these events cause extensive damage to the environment and result in enormous human
suffering, but they also adversely impact the macroeconomy, giving rise to significant financial risks.)
Dealing with financial risks is the core task of prudential supervision.
Climate-related and environmental risks (C&E risks) are now an important focal point for supervisors.
I The topic of today’s panel discussion — the legal aspects of the incorporation of environmental risks
in prudential supervision — could therefore not be more apt or timely.
| am thrilled to be chairing an all-female panel on this important topic with three distinguished
speakers, each of whom | will introduce before they speak.
In my short introductory remarks, | would like to explain why C&E risks merit special supervisory
attention from an economic perspective.
There are three main reasons. First, their size, global dimension and non-linearity, which imply large
downside tail risks. Second, the irreversible nature of climate change and environmental degradation,
and the corresponding time criticality for taking action. And third, the lack of knowledge and data on
these risks.
Size, global dimension and non-linearity
The sheer size of C&E risks justifies giving them special attention. Climate change constitutes an
existential threat, implying large downside tail risks.
According to the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System
(NGFS), up to 13% of global GDP would be at risk by the end of the century, even before accounting
for the potential consequences of severe weather events, sea-level rise and wider societal impacts
from migration or conflict.


Physical climate risks tend to be correlated globally, as evidenced by today’s simultaneous occurrence
of extreme weather events, limiting the scope for diversification and creating systemic risks for the
financial sector. The economic consequences of physical climate risks could be mitigated by closing
the large climate insurance protection gap. In the EU, only a quarter of losses caused by climate-
related catastrophes are insured, giving rise to additional risks to the macroeconomy, financial stability
and public finances./] At the same time, financial sector risks are not confined to physical climate
risks; the sector is also exposed to transition risks emanating from changes in policies around the
globe in response to climate change.
Lastly, the existence of tipping points may give rise to strong non-linearities. Small changes can have
much larger effects than observed historically, making predictions highly uncertain.
Irreversibility and time criticality
Asecond distinct feature of C&E risks is that if they materialise, the effects are often irreversible.
Therefore, taking action is time critical to slow down global warming and the degradation of the
environment.
An orderly climate transition is more likely if decisive action is taken at an early stage. In an orderly
transition, a sudden repricing of assets can be avoided and financial intermediaries are able to
gradually rebalance their investment portfolios and build up buffers that can absorb potential future
losses
Moreover, in contrast to other risks, C&E risks have an important feedback mechanism, which
accentuates time criticality. Not only does climate change affect the risks on financial intermediaries’
balance sheets, but the financing of climate or environmentally unfriendly activities also amplifies C&E
risks, creating externalities.
Lack of knowledge and data
A third important feature of C&E risks is that the data available and the knowledge we have about
them remain limited. We know that climate change and biodiversity loss are already unfolding rapidly
but we still lack knowledge about their precise timing and potential tipping points. This means that we
must work with scenarios with an unknown probability of occurrence.
Economic models of climate change are typically calibrated on historical data, which means they have
difficulties in accounting for non-linear dynamics that have never been observed. They may therefore
underestimate the economic fallout. The use of scenarios, as done in macroeconomic climate stress
tests, provides a useful way forward. But such scenarios may need to be enriched by socioeconomic
factors, such as the risk of violent conflict or mass migration.
Even for known risks, the data are limited. Private and official data providers are working intensively to
close the data gaps. To make progress on this front, there is an urgent need for further disclosure
initiatives based on the double materiality principle. 2
In view of the existing data and knowledge gaps, it is very likely that climate-related and environmental
risks are currently underpriced. Some risks may not be priced at all, as confirmed by recent research.


Ea Rating agencies have only just started to incorporate climate risk into their models.
According to our bottom-up climate stress test, most banks under European banking supervision
insufficiently consider climate-related risks in their credit assessments.'“2] At the same time, various
initiatives on the supervisory front show that banks are making progress in their management of C&E
risks, although the trend is not uniform and laggards remain in all areas,
Market mispricing of C&E risks can only be mitigated if more information on those risks becomes
available, especially via comprehensive disclosures. In this respect, we still have a long way to go.
To conclude, climate-related and environmental risks merit special attention owing to their size, global
dimension and non-linearity, the irreversible nature of the damage they can cause, the resulting time
criticality of action, as well as knowledge and data gaps.
| am now curious to hear how the incorporation of environmental considerations in the supervision of
prudential risks is seen from a legal perspective.
So let me turn to our first speaker, Suzanne Kingston.
Since January 2022, Suzanne has been a Judge at the General Court. Before that she was a Senior
Counsel practising at the Irish bar. Moreover, she looks back on a distinguished academic career,
teaching law at prestigious universities such as the University College Dublin, Columbia University and
Cambridge University, among others, and received a prestigious ERC grant on how to make nature
laws more effective.
So, we are very much looking forward to hearing your insights.
Our second speaker is Juliana Bolzani.
Juliana is senior counsel at the International Monetary Fund, working at the Fiscal and Financial Unit
of the Legal Department, which provides legal advice to member countries on the design and
implementation of legal reforms. Before joining the IMF, she worked as a lawyer at the Central Bank of
Brazil. She is a specialist on central bank independence and the evolution of central banks’ legal
mandates, and she has also written about greening central banks’ balance sheets.
We are very curious to hear your views.
Our final speaker is Veerle Colaert.
Veerle holds the chair for financial law at KU Leuven University and is co-director of the Jan Ronse
Institute for Company and Financial Law. Additionally, she is the chair of the Securities and Markets
Stakeholders Group advising the European Securities and Markets Authority, and she is a member of
the Belgian Resolution Authority. One of her many research interests is sustainable finance.
Great to have you here — the floor is yours.

According to “back of the envelope” calculations performed (see Allianz (2023), “Global boiling:
Heatwave may have cost 0.6pp of GDP”, 4 August), the recent heatwave may have caused losses of
around 0.6 per cent of GDP in the United States, southern Europe and China in 2023.

For example, if losses are not covered by insurance, the speed at which households and firms can
resume their activities is reduced, slowing economic recovery. Additionally, the financial position of
governments may be weakened if they need to provide relief to cover uninsured losses. See ECB
