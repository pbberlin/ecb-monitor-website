Ladies and Gentlemen,  
It is a pleasure to speak today at this historical conference organised in 
partnership with the Fondation Napoléon . This year, 2025, marks the 225th 
anniversary of the Banque de France, founded by Napoleon Bonaparte as a 
‘mass of granite’ to stabilise the scattered ‘grains of sand’ of the Nation and 
participate in its reconstruction after the Convention and the Directo ry. I think 
that we can all agree that the results have lived up to our ambitions: the Banque 
de France, its women and men, remain one of the cornerstones of the national 
– and now European – edifice and have enabled it to weather times of economic 
and fin ancial turmoil. These successes are primarily due to the dynamic 
governance that has constantly renewed itself in order to serve an increasingly 
broad general interest (I). This year, which is particularly fraught with uncertainty 
at both the national and international levels, a few key episodes in our history 
also provide two lessons in resilience for France (II) and Europe (III).   
I) A dynamic governance  
The current governance of the Banque de France is the result of more than two 
centuries of evolution , which has led our institution to serve an incre asingly 
broad general interest. The Banque de France, born of the Consulate, was 
originally a listed company . The First Consul was also the first of its private 
shareholders: a different era! The Bank provided genuine public services for the 
Paris financial centre: issuing banknotes and setting an attractive and stable 
discount rate. It was administered by a Council of Regency made up of 
representatives elected by its 200 main shareholders. From 1806 ,i the state's 
influence over the Bank grew stronger: a Governor, assisted by two Deputy 
Governors, all appointed by the head of state, was placed at its helm. As 
Napoleon Bonaparte famously said: “I want the Bank to be sufficiently in the 
hands of the Government and not too much so.” 
For several decades, the Banque de France remained de facto the ‘Bank of 
Paris’ because it had a monopoly on issuing banknotes limited to a local 
area. As of 1848 ,ii this monopoly was extended to the whole of France, thus 

Page 2 sur 6 
 
lending our activities a national dimension. This new scope of action was 
accompanied in 1936 by a democratisation of governance. iii  The Council of 
Regency was replaced by the General Council: 20 councillors, the bulk of whom 
were appointed  by the public au thorities, succeeded the 15 regents. All 
shareholders – and no longer just the 200 main ones , known as the “200 
families” - were henceforth represented at the General Meeting. This process 
was completed in December 1945 iv with the nationalisation of the Ban k, which 
became a public institution , wholly owned by the state , supporting policies for 
the reconstruction and modernisation of the French economy.  
Our governance evolved once again with the Law of 4 August 1993v when the 
Banque de France gained its independence. A Monetary Policy Council, chaired 
by the Governor, is in charge of setting monetary policy “without seeking or 
accepting instructions from the government or any other body”. These first steps 
towards Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) were consolidated in 1999: the 
Banque de France became part of a federal system by joining the Eurosystem, 
which consists of the European Central Bank (ECB), of which it holds a 20% 
stake, and the 20 national central banks. Decisions concerning monetary policy 
are now taken collectively by the Governing Council of the ECB, chaired by 
Christine Lagarde, while our General Council continues to deliberate on internal 
management issues.  
To sum up , in 225 years, we have changed shareholders, the type of 
relationship we have with the public authorities – from controlled autonomy to 
independence – and geographical scope – from Paris to Europe. But we have 
not changed our own ‘governance’ – we still h ave a Governor (I am the 31st) 
and two Deputy Governors, fewer than many other comparable central banks – 
nor, above all, our missions: monetary and price stability, and the smooth 
financing of the economy.  
II) A beacon of confidence in France  
The Banque de France has therefore represented a beacon of confidence in 
times of economic and financial turmoil. The stabilisation of the French franc is 

Page 3 sur 6 
 
a prime example. After the First World War, the French economy gradually sank 
into a crisis that worsened from 1924 onwards. There were three main 
symptoms: a deterioration in public finances, a sharp depreciation of the franc 
and government instability – there were eight ministers of finance between 1925 
and 1926. Headed by its new governor Émile Moreau (1926-1930), the Banque 
de France endeavoured to defend the franc on the foreign exchange markets 
and it managed to stabilise it at a rate that was conducive to confidence and 
financial stability at the end of 1926. At the same time, Émile Moreau engaged 
in extensive discussions with Raymond Poincaré, President of the Council  of 
Ministers, to convince him of the need to stabilise the franc, i.e. devaluation from 
its pre-war parity. Émile Moreau had no hesitation in threatening to resign in the 
national interest.vi The President of the Council  of Ministers ended up coming 
around to the position of the Banque de France: the monetary law of 25 June 
1928 introduced the “Poincaré” franc and brought lasting calm to the financial 
turmoil.  
This is not an isolated example: several Banque de France personalities spurred 
on a national recovery in the face of danger. In 1958 for example, the De Gaulle-
Pinay-Rueff financial stabilisation plan was largely inspired vii by the economist 
Jacques Rueff, former Deputy Governor of the Banque  de France. Wilfrid 
Baumgartner, former Governor of the Banque de France (1949-1960) and 
Minister of Finance from 1960, ensured that it was successful. Two decades 
later in 1983, Jacques Delors – whose name this auditorium honours – averted 
the spectre of a financial crisis by implementing fiscal cuts and de -indexation 
measures to keep France in the European Monetary Systemviii (EMS). 
We are an old and a great country that has overcome a number of serious crises 
over the course of our history. This provides a lesson in resilience – and perhaps 
in hope – at a time when our country has to regain control of its public finances. 
And public opinion appreciates it when fiscal crises are overcome: each of the 
personalities I referred to forged a strong political and historical stature, showing 
that the French know how to recognise sound public management. The Banque 

Page 4 sur 6 
 
de France intends to remain a beacon of confidence in the face of current 
uncertainties. Thanks to the almost certain victory over inflation, the Bank’s 
credible action means that the euro enjoys a historically high level of support 
from 81% of European citizens – and 76% of the French population. ix Drawing 
upon its independence, it also has a duty to provide the political authorities with 
its views and technical expertise on economic and fiscal issues, especially as 
these are subject to strong short-term pressures and a highly volatile and fraught 
public debate. We are currently at a historical turning point and – I say this in all 
seriousness – our response may be found wanting. However, our long history 
gives us an idea of what it takes to bounce back : to elevate public debate, we 
must first extend the timeframe beyond current obsessions. We now n eed to 
broaden the scope and learn to work together instead of engaging in French -
style petty squabbling.   
III) An independent institution working for European monetary sovereignty 
Indeed, the other contemporary lesson – alongside necessary French reform – 
is the need to work for European monetary sovereignty (III). Two significant 
episodes illustrate this.  
First, the ‘battle of the franc’, also known as the ‘EMS crisis’, which occurred 
between 1992 and 1993 at a pivotal moment between the signing of the 
Maastricht Treaty and its effective implementation. In September 1992, just 
when the Treaty was due to be ratified in several Member States, speculative 
attacks targeted European currencies, forcing some of them to leave the EMS. 
Jacques de Larosière was Governor at the time and Jean -Claude Trichet, who 
was to succeed him at the end of 1993, was still Director of the French Treasury. 
The Banque de France intervened massivelyx on the foreign exchange markets 
to support the franc. If the franc had left the EM S, it would have meant that the 
European Monetary Union project would have been abandoned for a long time. 
Fortunately, this did not happen – although it was a close -run thing – and the 
crisis was resolved within a European framework, as was the case later  in July 
1993, when the EMS fluctuation margins were finally widened, putting an end to 

Page 5 sur 6 
 
the pressure on exchange rates. Better still, this crisis revealed the fragile nature 
of fixed exchange rates between national currencies and, in so doing, 
strengthened the determination of Member States to complete the transition to 
Monetary Union as quickly as possible. 
I will now move on to a second crisis, this time an existential one for the euro 
area. As of 2009, the global financial crisis began to mutate into a s overeign 
debt crisis in the euro area. Certain heavily indebted Member States faced the 
prospect of losing access to capital markets, and the euro area was in danger 
of breaking up. This was the first real test of the collective response capacity of 
the Eu rosystem. It responded decisively by granting long -term loans to 
commercial banks, buying sovereign bonds of Member States in difficulty on the 
secondary market where necessary, and managing the specific cases of the 
hardest-hit banks. Despite differences of opinion, the Member States managed 
to find common ground through trust-based dialogue: they established a safety 
net and created the European Stability Mechanism and the Banking Union  
These two crises taught us another lesson in resilience: by acting t ogether, 
Europe has become more robust. In the words of Mario Draghi, Europe gained 
the ability “to control its destiny” xi thanks to this unique monetary sovereignty, 
recognised - and sometimes envied - throughout the worldxii. 
* 
Given the current disheartening American u-turn, the euro's success serves as 
a reminder of a more general lesson: should it so wish, Europe has the 
resources to achieve economic, financial and, in the longer term, military 
sovereignty. Today – and I say this with sadness for the great nation of America 
– it is better to be European than American. If we so wish, Europe's time has 
come. Rest assured that the Banque de France will build this strong Europe out 
of granite.

viii The European Monetary System (EMS), created in 1979, was intended to boost monetary policy cooperation 
between members of the European Economic Community (EEC). The exchange rate of a given European currency 
against all other currencies could not vary bey ond fixed “fluctuation margins” and to prevent fluctuations from 
exceeding this limit, central banks had to intervene on the foreign exchange markets.
