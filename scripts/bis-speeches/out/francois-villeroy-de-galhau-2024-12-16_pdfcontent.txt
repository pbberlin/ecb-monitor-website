Ladies and Gentlemen, 
I am delighted to open  – here in the Jacques Delors  amphitheatre – this 
conference organised by Banque de France around the question of “Central 
banks as political players?”  I would like to warmly thank  all members of the 
Historical Committee, in particular Michel Margairaz and Olivier Feiertag, whom 
we will have the chance to listen to  today, among other historians. We have 
always been wary of this question because in the distant past, the Banque de 
France and its “regents” were sometimes criticised for their presumed “political” 
influence. Fortunately, times have changed and the Banque de France now 
belongs to all French citizens. This independence from political power is now 
well asserted and – better still – widely recognised.i Obviously, it is not “self-
attributed” but stems from democratic power with a specific mandate, namely 
price stability. Incidentally, as we are in a silent period, I will not talk about 
monetary policy today.  
Consequently, the Banque de France does not position itself as a political player 
even though it is a key public player: it strives to provide the best services on 
the ground at the lowest cost. Now more than ever, it aims to be a catalyst for 
inclusion through its battle against inflation and overindebtedness and its role in 
promoting financial literacy; to reduce uncertainty through its economic surveys 
and forecasts and its financial supervision; and to be a long -term stakeholder 
through its commitment to the climate. 
But today I invite you to take the opportunity of this historical conference to take 
both a step back from ongoing budgetary and parliamentary events – however 
weighty they may be – and a step to the side: central banks can be seen  as 
careful observers of the current challenges facing public services, if only through 
the consequences of fiscal policy on the policy mix , the second ingredient of 
which is  monetary policy . I am also going to speak as someone who is 
passionate about public service and who believes profoundly in the European 
social model. This unique combination of universally accessible essential 
services, strong social protection and tax redistribution has produced – 
particularly in our country – some of the most cohesive societies in the world, 

2 
 
and some of the most competent public authorities. However, visible difficulties 
are increasing in almost all advanced countries, and particularly in our own, 
public action is becoming more and more extended and expected, less and less 
well financed and financeable, and often perceived as less and less effective. 
This is why I would like to present an “anatomy” of these challenges in France, 
first over time for the purpose of understanding them (I), and then from a spatial 
perspective, for the purpose of taking action (II).  
I. Understanding: an anatomy over time 
1.1. A concomitant but non-convergent increase in public spending and revenue 
has fuelled a continuous deterioration in our public finances 
Our public finances have been steadily deteriorating for over forty years. In 
1984, our public debt represented just 30% of gross domestic product (GDP); 
today, it has more than tripled to 110% of GDP.  
  
This proportion fell only slightly after the Covid shock, and now stands more 
than 20 points above the euro area average (87%), and almost 50 points above 
that of Germany (63%). This is largely due to the fact that public spending has 
been rising faster than revenues. This “non-congruence” generates systematic 
structural deficits, which drive the increase in public debt . And this leads us to 
remember the obvious: regardless of the political situation, France needs to put 


3 
 
its public finances in order. This is in our national interest , which  transcends 
partisan interests. 
 
Our problem is due primarily to the growth in our public spending. Beyond a 
“ratchet effect” that is particularly marked in France after each crisis, it is above 
all the rise in welfare and local spending that has fuelled this increase over the 
past thirty years . As regards local spending, this increase goes beyond the 
transfer of powers ii, but in the meantime,  fiscal revenue transfers from the 
central government  – including a proportion of VAT  – have increased 
dynamically, so that the rise in spending  is not immediately noticeable  in the 
financial balances of local authorities. 
  
Indeed, spending by social security funds and local government bodies grew by 
3.4 and 1.6 percentage points of GDP, respectively between 2000 and 2023. In 


4 
 
contrast, central government expenditure fell by 0.5 percentage points of GDP 
over the same period.  
1.2. This deterioration is compounded by a concomitant increase in what French 
citizens expect from the state and in the complexity of public action 
On the one hand, our fellow citizens have increasingly high expectations of the 
state, many of which are justified on objective grounds. I am convinced that 
public authority must respond to the long -term challenges facing France and 
Europe, such as climate change, security and an ageing population. iii Some of 
these expectations are also subjective, as a result of the precautionary principle 
inter alia. We have handed the state a n increasingly important role as “insurer 
of first resort” in the face of crises (think Covid or the inflationary episode of 
2022), as well as risks of all kinds, including accidental risks, without taxpayers 
– companies and households – really being prepared to collectively contribute 
to this insurance via their taxes. In response to changing expectations, the state 
has turned into an ex post repairer, including of ex ante failures in public policies. 
Compensation for shortcomings in the labour market  and training is a good 
example: for the past 30 years, private-sector employment has been supported 
by a stack of reductions in social security contributions. These exemptions now 
cost us 2.7 percentage points of GDP, compared with just 1 percentage point in 
2012, and 0.5 percentage point in 1999.  
On the other hand, public action has become much more complex. This 
complexity is difficult to measure but we can gauge it from a number of 
indicators. 
The number of standards introduced by the state is constantly in creasing. To 
give a very concrete example, the number of words on the French government 
website Légifrance, listing the standards in force in France, has doubled in 
twenty years, from 23 million in 2002 to 45 million in 2023. iv This “inflation” in 
standards discourages initiatives and adds to the administrative burden on 
households and business owners, representing an estimated annual cost of 
between 3% and 8% of our GDP.v  

5 
 
This increasing complexity is also affecting our administrative structures. I will 
take two examples: local administration , and government operators. Over the 
past forty years, the process of decentralisation has resulted in an 
unprecedented tangle of responsibilities and powers at local authority level .vi 
This administrative patchwork generates considerable coordination costs and 
undermines the clarity and legitimacy of the many players involved, particularly 
at intermunicipal level. With almost 370,000 employees, the latter now represent 
19% of the local government workforce, vii without any corresponding reduction 
in the number of municipal employees. However, their role is not sufficiently 
clear for the general public, who tends to think that “everything gets done by 
everyone”. viii Moreover, despite the extensive streamlining that began in 2013, 
there are still too many government operators (434 at present, ix employing a 
total of almost 500,000 peoplex), with a heavy resulting oversight burden.  
A “fiscal allergy” therefore risks bei ng compounded henceforth by a 
“bureaucratic allergy”. A number of public services have been contending with 
a crisis for several years, along with decreasing satisfaction among French 
citizens:xi over the past fifteen years, this has been particularly acute  in health 
and education (where a decline in satisfaction of almost 20 percentage points 
has been recorded). Despite a recent improvement, justice remains the public 
service for which user satisfaction is still significantly low . This impression that 
public services are going downhill is often put forward as a contributor to the rise 
in the protest vote in numerous countries.xii 
 


6 
 
These French “allergies” also reflect a contradictory desire for more government 
but less tax and fewer rules. Frédéric Bastiat's famous quote, “The state is that 
great fictitious entity by which everyone seeks to live at the expense of everyone 
else”, is thus strikingly apposite today. These contradictions are weighing more 
and more heavily, not only on our public finances but also on our political debate. 
All too often, some people are tempted to resolve them by “civil servant 
bashing”. But it is by working with civil servants and managers, not against them, 
that we will succeed: while being demanding  of civil servants is legitimate, 
systematic and often demagogical criticism of them is not. Unfortunately, we are 
currently witnessing an extreme example on the other side of the Atlantic. 
II. Action: a spatial analysis 
2.1 Overall, there is no evidence that “public production” is better in France  
Of course, many of these symptoms can be found in other OECD countries – 
and in many respects, Italy most closely mirrors our situation – however they 
are most acute in France. Let  us take Denmark and Sweden as benchmarks. 
Between 1995 and 2022, Germany and Sweden reduced their government 
expenditure ratio from 59% to 45%, and from 63% to 49%, respectively. 
Meanwhile, our country has gone from fourth to the top of the table in terms  of 
government expenditure.  
  
Government expenditure in France, at around 57% of GDP in 2023, xiii is 9.3 
percentage points of GDP higher than the average for the euro area excluding 


7 
 
France – a gap of around EUR 260 billion. For all that, is public production better 
in France? 
 
Certain objective outcomes are positive . Inequalities continue to be more 
contained in France than in our neighbouring economies, and even more so 
than in the United States. In its first “augmented national accounts”, xiv INSEE 
estimated that the extended redistribution (all transfers including those 
associated with public services) in France reduces the income ratio between the 
wealthiest 10% and the poorest 10% by a factor of six before and after transfers. 
Consequently, the French Gini coefficient after transfers, is among the lowest. 
 
Our level of public investment is significantly higher than that of our neighbours 
(4.3% of GDP in France, compared with 3.3% for the euro area as a whole, and 


8 
 
2.8% in Germ any) and this is apparent in the quality of our roads and 
infrastructure. And public spending has protected households and businesses 
against a succession of economic shocks following the 2009 financial crisis. For 
a long period, household purchasing power rose more markedly in France than 
in the euro area as a whole (by a cumulative 30% since 1999, compared with 
only 18% for the euro area), xv even though public perception is nowhere near 
as favourable.  
By contrast, there is less growth in France: GDP  per c apita has risen more 
slowly in France, by a cumulative 21% between  1999 and 2023 compared with 
26% in the euro  area as a whole, which itself lags considerably behind the 
United States (up 39%) in terms of growth.  
 
Furthermore, our government expenditure has not created more jobs  than in 
neighbouring countries: in France, the unemployment rate remains higher, and 
the employment rate lower , than in the euro area as a whole, despite 
improvements in the labour market over the past decade or so. Last and most 
importantly, social cohesion and life satisfaction are no better in France than 
elsewhere. Between 2010 and 2023, the OECD social cohesion indicator 
deteriorated more sharply for France than for any other country.xvi And France's 
life satisfaction index, at 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, stands slightly below the 
European Union average of 7.1 .xvii Here we touch on the promising research 
into the “economics of happiness” or “well -being”xviii, and its paradoxes, 


9 
 
especially by Richard Easterlin  (relative comparison counts for more than 
absolute prosperity). 
 
2.2 This landscape may appear bleak... but these comparisons are actually 
opportunities for action and grounds for hope 
We can draw positive lessons from the experience of our neighbours, who have 
succeeded in reining in and even reducing their government expenditure while 
preserving their social model and maintaining growth. xix This leads me to 
consider the composition of our own government expenditure and to compare 
our spending with that of the best-performing economies 
Obviously, the Banque de France is no t a  decision-maker when it comes to 


10 
 
choices in expenditure, which are a matter for democratic debate. International 
comparisons help to inform the debate, however the work of France Stratégie,xx 
the European Commission, xxi the OECD xxii and the IMF xxiii in this regard 
continues to be surprisingly little-known. Among other things , they make it 
possible to define an “efficiency frontier” for public spending, by comparing the 
relationship between each category of public expenditure and one or more 
international performance indicators in different countries. These “frontiers” 
raise methodological questionsxxiv, but also provide valuable insights. 
France’s spending on social protection in the broadest sense xxv is significantly 
higher than the euro area average excluding France, at around 6.3 points of 
GDP in 2022 – or more than half of the total gap. Admittedly, some of this can 
be explained by different pension systems and the choice of pay -as-you-go 
rather than funded systems (capitalisation). However, i n its analysis published 
in early 2023, the IMF reported that France, despite having the highest spending 
on social protection out of a sample of fifteen comparable countries, is further 
from the efficiency frontier than Finland, Portugal, the Netherlands or Denmark. 
France is barely above average in terms of its spending efficiency. Indeed, some 
transfers are means -tested to a lesser extent than in other countries, which 
explains the comparatively weaker redist ributive effect of its social protection 
spending.  


11 
 
In this overview, I will not revisit the better -known examples of spending on 
pensions – which accounts for the most significant differential – or 
unemployment benefits. But it is instructive to consider the example of spending 
on healthcare, which accounts for 1.9 percentage points of the total gap 
between France and the rest of the euro area.  
 
We have significant possibilities for improvement compared with countries such 
as Spain, Sweden, Belgium or the Netherlands, with higher spending for 
comparable results across key indicators (healthy life expectancy, healthcare 
system satisfaction, etc.). There are also more workers in public administration: 
they account for 34% of the total workforce in the hospital sector, compared with 
23% in Spain and 21% in Germany . Furthermore, in other countries, medical 
systems that focus more on prevention improve healthy life expectancy and limit 
the incidence of chronic diseases.   
Spending on education is 0.7 percentage point of GDP higher than the euro 
area average excluding France, partly due to the higher proportion of the 
population attending school in France. xxvi However, the way this expenditure is 
allocated between primary educa tion (under -resourced compared with other 
countries) and secondary education (relatively over-resourced in comparison) is 
rather atypical. The proportion given over to administrative and operating costs 
is significantly higher than in other countries  (see the dark blue component in 
the left-hand chart below). Our high level of spending did not prevent a sharper 


12 
 
decline between the PISA 2018 and 2022 surveys. In this respect, Finland gets 
better value per euro spent. 
 
Housing, which contributes an estimated total of approximately 2% of GDP (0.8 
point of GDP more than the euro area average excluding France), is also a major 
source of expenditure. 
 
Six million households – one in five – currently receive housing benefits, xxvii 
which therefore appears to be means-tested to a much lesser extent  than in 
other countries. These substantial amounts can ultimately push up market 
prices – including rents. On top of this, there are numerous tax credit schemes. 


13 
 
The Cour des Comptes  has therefore reported that France’s housing policy 
“struggles to demonstrate its effectiveness”.xxviii  
As a final example, which partly overlaps with previous ones, subsidies and 
transfers (unrelated to social protection) amounted to EUR  210 billion  in 
France in 2023, that is 7.4% of GDP compared to an average for the rest of the 
euro area of just 6.0%. Their increase in France since 1996 has contributed 2.2 
points of GDP to the rise in public spending. Among this expenditure, certain tax 
credits and support for apprenticeship programs would benefit from being more 
clearly targeted. More generally,  there are grounds for reviewing certain 
acquired rights and for de-indexation.  
2.3 Reopening the “blind spot” in the public debate: qualitative levers and 
public governance 
Every year, the World Bank publishes an index of government effectiveness,xxix 
which draws from a range of studies and surveys. xxx In particular, it focuses on 
the degree of independence from political pressures, public policy formulation 
and implementation, and the quality of public services. France's government 
effectiveness score has slowly but steadily declined since the beginnin g of the 
2000s, dropping from 1.75 in 2004 to 1.16 in 2022 (over a distribution ranging 
from -2.5 to +2.5). In the 2010s, Denmark managed to reverse a similar 
downward trend, pushing its score back up to a high level of 2 in 2022. We can 
thus assess the qualitative levers that we can deploy.  
 


14 
 
Several attempts have been made to reform government action, from the 
Organic Budget Law (LOLF) of 2001, which aimed for performance -focused 
management, to the more recent Action Publique 2022. Buy-in and the results  
obtained have generally fallen short of expectations.  
I am well aware of how difficult it is for successive governments to deal with the 
unrelenting pressure of urgency, exacerbated by a succession of 
unprecedented crises. But far from being some fatalis tic pessimist, I believe in 
public services as a national asset. Throughout our long history, from Bonaparte 
to Charles de Gaulle, public services have frequently been a catalyst for unity, 
modernity and even productivity. I also believe that they can be turned around. 
Transforming public services can and must serve to boost France’s 
competitiveness. These are not merely pious hopes: examples of successful 
public service modernisation exist in France. Aside from the example of the 
Banque de France , which I mentioned in my introduction , we should mention 
the Public Finances Directorate (Direction Générale des Finances Publiques , 
DGFiP), which has improved the quality of the service it provides, particularly to 
private individuals, while at the same time achieving significant economies of 
scale by pooling its support functions (headcount was reduced by 29% between 
1998 and 2023).xxxi Of all public services, taxation and tax collection now have 
the highest customer satisfaction rating at 80%.xxxii  
A strategy for public finances and ambitions for government action are not 
incompatible. On the contrary: “reconciling the dynamics of modernisation with 
the imperative of restoring balance to public finances is essential”.xxxiii The path 
of compatibility must include four as pects, on which central banks can offer 
instructive lessons.  
The first essential aspect is long-term thinking and continuity. Management 
of public finances is now based more on  a multi-year perspective – which is a 
good thing – with the adoption of public  finance planning acts from 2009 
onwards. However, when it comes to executing the process , we have never 
honoured our commitments. And it takes time, patience and tenacity to achieve 
savings in public spending. It would therefore be desirable for the medium-term 

15 
 
– through 2029 – fiscal consolidation plan, which is more necessary than ever, 
to include a more significant and better-documented savings component.  
This brings us to the second aspect – effective implementation by public-sector 
participants. In this respect, the central plank of effective governance is 
“contractualisation” matched by “responsibilisation” – i.e., respecting the 
allocated resources and achieving the mutually agreed objectives. The Cour des 
Comptes rightly recommends follow ing this method, xxxiv drawing on past 
examples from INSEE and DGFiP. I can also vouch for its effectiveness as a 
practitioner. France still boasts excellent civil servants and public service 
managers: let us delegate responsibilities and resources to them, within a 
multiannual framework, in exchange for more clearly defined objectives. Many 
public servants are ready; all they ask for is this trust and freedom. 
The third aspect is an essential vector for the transformat ion of public services; 
one which we are all expecting but which has all too often been neglected – 
simplification. An over-abundance of regulations reduces competition, 
discourages entrepreneurs and hampers productive investment. Today, there is 
a new con sensus in principle in Europe in favour of simplification. The Draghi 
report,xxxv following the Letta report, xxxvi identified the simplification of rules as 
one of the keys to European competitiveness and a more effective state. We 
need to learn to regularly "take a broom" to those constraints that are vestiges 
of the past or no longer useful. Although this calls for a massive, structured and 
costed simplification effort, it is possible and it will meet the high expectations of 
citizens and SMEs alike.  
The final aspect is clarity of objectives ex ante and of actual results ex post. 
What undermines government action and makes our fellow citizens so sceptical 
is the proliferation of announcements in the media that have not resulted in any 
effective action, and of plans and objectives that are rarely prioritised and are 
often contradictory. Less talk, more accountability for genuine action: this dose 
of realism would do us all good.  
*

16 
 
In conclusion, France should be capable of overcoming the crisis in government 
action by using a number of levers. First, comparisons with our peers, which 
show where greater public spending efficiency is possible – and necessary. 
Next, the four ingredients that I just me ntioned: (i) long -term thinking and 
continuity, freeing ourselves from the tyranny of the short term; (ii) 
implementation based on contractualisation, within a framework of trust; (iii) 
simplification that is essential and measurable; and (iv) a focus on actual results 
ex post, based on clearly defined objectives.   
In 1963, Charles de Gaulle, speaking about France’s budget, said these words, 
which are all the more striking today: “Everyone must understand that one day, 
they will have to pay.  [...] You have  to look at the problem from above: both 
individuals and the state have easy money . [...] A stable budget [...] must 
become the rule. [...] This means that, for young people – for the future – it's 
huge, it's revolutionary!” xxxvii As for t he revolution of a structurally balanced 
budget, we are clearly not there yet. Let us first initiate a period of public service 
reform. Thank you for your attention.
