Monetary Policy and Macroeconomic Forecasts: 
The Last Fifty Years
Keynote speech by Fabio Panetta* 
Governor of Banca d’Italia
Prometeia 50 Conference  
Milan, Museo della Scienza e Tecnologia, 18 June 2025
I would like to thank the Prometeia association for inviting me to take part in this 
conference, marking the fiftieth anniversary of its founding.
Since 1974, Prometeia has contributed to the Italian economic debate with 
economic analyses and forecasts, in line with its original mission as the “Association 
for Econometric Forecasts“. Over time, it has come to play a prominent role by 
developing its own modelling tools capable of generating reliable forecasts and 
evaluating the impact of economic policies.
1
Over the past fifty years, the macroeconomic landscape has changed profoundly. 
Changes in shocks, progress in economic theory, and the experience gained have 
transformed the role of central banks, redefining how they safeguard the purchasing 
power of money and financial stability.
The tools available to central bankers have also evolved. The growing availability of 
data, together with advances in economic and statistical analysis, has enabled the 
development of more sophisticated forecasting models, better suited to grasp the 
complexity of today’s economy.
In my remarks, I will focus on three interconnected areas: the conduct of monetary 
policy, macroeconomic modelling, and the use of forecasts in central banks’ 
decision-making processes. Their proper interaction is a fundamental element for 
more informed, timely, and effective monetary action – especially in a constantly 
evolving environment.
* I would like to thank Stefano Siviero for his help in writing this speech.
1 Prometeia and Banca d’Italia were among the pioneers in the development of econometric models in 
Italy. In the 1960s, the Bank’s econometric efforts drew the attention of Beniamino Andreatta, who later 
became one of Prometeia’s main advocates. In 1969, he wrote: “ The path forward is the one already 
pursued by our central bank for years: to refine its interpretative frameworks and develop an increasingly 
sophisticated system for gathering the necessary statistical data.“ (B. Andreatta, “Il disegno della politica 
della Banca centrale e l’uso di modelli econometrici di flussi monetari“, Bancaria, 1, 1969, p. 18).

1.  Central bank independence, price stability, and forecasts
In the early 1970s – when, even in Italy, monetary policy was not yet separate from other 
public policies – forecasts, including those on inflation, were not considered essential. 
Central banks pursued intermediate objectives, such as the defence of the exchange rate 
or the growth of monetary aggregates, often using administrative tools. 2 Price stability 
was not yet their primary goal.
Since then, profound changes in the macroeconomic and institutional context, along with 
significant innovations in economic theory, have increased the importance of forecasts 
in monetary policymaking. As I will explain later, this evolution was not linear: phases of 
affirmation and consolidation alternated with periods of refining models and rethinking 
their role in guiding monetary policy. 
A turning point came with the inflationary wave between the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 
response to that shock, many central banks gained independence and adopted medium-
term price stability as their stated primary objective.3
Macroeconomic forecasts – especially those concerning inflation – thus became a 
structural and essential component of the monetary policy toolkit. 
Independence, however, required greater transparency and accountability. Central banks 
were expected to explain and justify their decisions: the publication of forecasts, along 
with information on the models used, became an essential factor for transparency and 
accountability.
Today, almost all central banks regularly publish their forecasts.4 This practice reflects the 
awareness of the crucial role of expectations in inflation dynamics and in the transmission 
of monetary policy. Publishing forecasts not only promotes transparency; it also helps 
guide investors’ expectations, thereby strengthening the effectiveness of monetary 
policy.
This approach has radically transformed central bank communication. Fifty years ago, the 
prevailing view held that the effectiveness of monetary policy depended on its ability to 
surprise markets. Today, by contrast, most central banks explain their “reaction function“5 
2 The administrative tools used at that time included credit ceilings, portfolio constraints, and foreign 
exchange controls.
3 The adoption of price stability as the direct goal of monetary policy is mainly associated with the 
work of Svensson, who introduced the concepts of inflation targeting and inflation forecast targeting. 
See: Lars E.O. Svensson, “Inflation Targeting“, in B.M. Friedman and M. Woodford (eds.), Handbook of 
Monetary Economics, vol. 3, Amsterdam, New Holland, 2011, pp. 1237-1302.
4 Banca d’Italia has done this since 2007, in line with Eurosystem decisions. Before the early 2000s, 
central banks rarely released public forecasts. Banca d’Italia only published some simulations in May 
1992 using its quarterly model, to analyze public finance adjustment paths; these were essentially 
forecasts conditional on different fiscal scenarios.
5 The “reaction function“ describes how the central bank adjusts its policy tools in response to changes 
in the economic environment, in order to maintain price stability.

in order to guide market expectations. Some have gone even further, adopting forms of 
forward guidance6 and, at times, publishing the expected path of official rates they deem 
consistent with achieving the inflation target.7
2.  Economic instability, monetary policy, and forecasts in the 2000s 
Over the past twenty years, the main macroeconomic and financial variables have 
experienced wide fluctuations and increased sensitivity to shocks, marking a clear 
break from the Great Moderation period, characterized by stable growth and the rapid 
absorption of shocks.8
The phase of instability began with the global financial crisis of 2008-09, followed by 
the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the post-pandemic recession, and the inflation spike 
triggered by the energy crisis (Figure 1).
The increased volatility has led to two important changes in the nature and role of the 
forecasts produced by central banks.
6 Forward guidance refers to explicit indications about the future stance of monetary policy. The ECB 
adopted formal forward guidance between 2013 and 2021, when inflation was below the 2 percent 
target and official interest rates were at their lower bound.
7 This approach has been adopted by the central banks of Sweden, Norway, and New Zealand. Its 
benefits and risks are discussed by Ben Bernanke in his review of the Bank of England’s forecasting 
tools: B. Bernanke, “Forecasting for monetary policy making and communication at the Bank of 
England: a review“, Bank of England, 12 April, 2024.
8 The term “Great Moderation“ refers to the final decades of the last century, when major economies 
appeared to follow a stable trajectory, marked by small and temporary shocks that were quickly 
absorbed.

The first one concerns the growing awareness of the need to consider not only the central 
scenario of forecasts, but also the distribution of surrounding risks – an approach known 
as risk management. In a highly uncertain environment, it is essential for central banks to 
adopt a robust policy strategy, capable of responding in a balanced way to a wide range of 
possible developments, rather than relying solely on the optimal policy for the most likely 
scenario.
This orientation has profoundly transformed the practice of forecasting, establishing 
the development of alternative scenarios9 and the systematic assessment of uncertainty 
around the central projection as standard components of the process.10
In effect, the succession of extraordinary shocks – and the occasionally substantial 
forecast errors they produced – have enhanced the informational content of forecasts, 
making them more comprehensive and context-aware tools.
The second change concerns the role of macroeconomic projections in the decision-
making process of central banks, which at times has been partially reduced due to the 
sequence of major shocks mentioned earlier and the associated forecast errors. For 
example, the inflation surge of 2021-23 – the most intense in the last forty years – was 
not anticipated, mainly due to the sharp rise in energy prices linked to the war in Ukraine.
In response to these developments, central banks have started to use forecasts more 
cautiously, integrating them with alternative analyses and indicators – particularly those 
relating to core inflation – and paying increasing attention to actual data. In the euro 
area, this approach – known as data-dependence – has led to favouring decisions taken 
on a meeting-by-meeting basis.
Today, monetary policy in the euro area is once again being conducted under conditions 
of heightened uncertainty. 
The Eurosystem projections for the coming months indicate that inflation is likely to remain 
below the 2 per cent target for an extended period, alongside persistently weak economic 
activity. Nevertheless, the macroeconomic outlook remains subject to substantial and 
difficult-to-quantify risks. These arise, on the one hand, from conflicting signals in US trade 
policy and, on the other, from the recent escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran.
Against this backdrop, the ECB’s Governing Council, at its most recent meeting, reaffirmed a 
flexible approach, keeping its options open. It will continue to take decisions on a meeting-
by-meeting basis, without pre-committing to a defined course for monetary policy.
9 In June 2025, for instance, the Eurosystem presented two alternative scenarios, alongside its economic 
projections for the euro area, in order to assess the impact of different US trade policies compared with 
the forecasting scenario deemed likelier. 
10 This trend began with the Bank of England’s inflation fan charts. See: E. Britton, P. Fisher, and J. Whitley, 
The inflation report projections: understanding the fan chart , Bank of England, Quarterly Bulletin, 
March 1998, pp. 30-37. For the approach developed by Banca d’Italia, see: C. Miani and S. Siviero,

forecasts“, Banca d’Italia, Temi di discussione (Working Papers), 758, 2010.

3.  Forecasting Errors and Learning by Doing
As mentioned, econometric models have made significant forecasting errors in recent 
years, for example during the pandemic and the high inflation phase of 2022-23, 
reigniting debate about their reliability.
This is a crucial issue: major errors can compromise the timeliness and effectiveness of 
central bank actions, with tangible effects on price stability, growth, and employment.
In reality, most of these errors – particularly those relating to inflation – can be traced to 
the unpredictability of the exogenous shocks that occurred during that period, linked to 
geopolitical or environmental events rather than economic ones. 
For example, the surge in energy prices between 2021 and 2022 was largely driven by 
Russia’s manipulation of oil supply and its invasion of Ukraine. 11 Clearly, the ability to 
anticipate such events has little to do with the features of forecasting models.
A reassuring element, emerging from ex-post analyses, is that more than two-thirds 
of the forecasting error made by Banca d’Italia on 2022 inflation is attributable to the 
energy component; the figure rises to 80 per cent when food products are included 
(Figure 2).12

The lesson from the pandemic and energy crises concerns the need to refine the 
techniques for anticipating the behaviour of key exogenous variables, starting with 
energy prices themselves, which are notoriously volatile and particularly relevant for 
inflation.
It should be noted that the process of revising forecasting tools – initiated by Banca 
d’Italia and other central banks to account for exceptional events – is nothing new. 
The global financial crisis, for example, led to the introduction of mechanisms to 
simulate the effects of a potential credit crunch, 13 while the sovereign debt crisis 
spurred the development of tools to analyse “unconventional“ monetary policies.
In addition to the challenges posed by extraordinary shocks, there are well-known 
limitations relating to the nature of the data used in economic forecasts, which are 
often estimates and subject to subsequent revisions. Economic forecasters – unlike 
meteorologists – lack certainty even about current data. 14
Nevertheless, there are encouraging signs. Research by Banca d’Italia shows that, 
compared with the 2008 financial crisis, forecasts were adjusted promptly during the 
sovereign debt crisis and even more so during the pandemic. 15 The initial errors were 
still substantial, but the ability to correct them improved significantly.
Forecasting errors are, to a large extent, inevitable; the ability to learn from them is 
what makes the difference.
4.  Which Models?
Today, semi-structural econometric models remain a central tool for both private 
forecasters – such as Prometeia – and central banks. 16 In the Eurosystem, national 
forecasts for the euro area often rely on models of this type. 
Their resilience can be explained by their ability to reconcile two often conflicting 
needs: on the one hand, adherence to data; on the other, consistency with economic

recessions“, in R. Bardozzi (ed.), Economic multisectoral modelling between past and future: a tribute to

model“, Journal of Forecasting, 25, 2006, pp. 1-23.

16 The construction of the semi-structural econometric model of Banca d’Italia began in 1963 by a working 
group coordinated by Antonio Fazio and Guido Maria Rey, under the direction of then-Governor 
Guido Carli. Over time, several generations of the model have followed, with major contributions 
from Franco Modigliani (in the initial phase) and Albert Ando (from 1982 to 2002). These generations 
were regularly documented in Bank publications, including: “Un modello econometrico dell’economia 
italiana (M1BI)“, Banca d’Italia, 1970; A. Fazio and B. Sitzia, “The quarterly econometric model of the 
Bank of Italy. Structure and policy applications“, Banca d’Italia, 1979; I. Visco et al., “Modello trimestrale 
dell’economia italiana“, Banca d’Italia, Temi di discussione del Servizio Studi, 80, 1986; G. Galli,

theory. Purely statistical models, although sometimes more accurate in the short term, 
do not clarify the underlying economic mechanisms or ensure internal consistency 
between variables. In other words, they do not provide monetary authorities with 
the economic narrative that is indispensable for the analysis and communication of 
policy decisions. 17
At the other extreme, more theoretically sophisticated models may fail to use 
empirical information efficiently. Semi-structural models, though involving inevitable 
compromises, manage to integrate a wide range of data while maintaining a 
recognizable theoretical framework. 18
For this reason, most central banks continue to use them, alongside a range of 
alternative tools within a “model suite“. Banca d’Italia also follows this approach, 
using more statistical models for short-term forecasts and more theoretical ones for 
medium- and long-term projections.
New Frontiers: Integrated Models and Computing Power
Recent advances in computing capabilities are opening up new possibilities for 
economic analysis, enabling the integration of macroeconomic models with 
microeconomic analysis tools. This combined approach has made it possible to 
address issues that macroeconometric models alone could not tackle effectively.
For example, analyses by Banca d’Italia show that the quantitative easing policies 
adopted in the pre-pandemic period, contrary to some expectations, did not exacerbate 
inequalities but rather produced moderately positive redistributive effects. 19
The combination of micro and macro levels has also proven useful in other areas, 
allowing for the estimation of potential output while avoiding the “aggregation 
bias“, 20 and providing more accurate measures of the effects of credit rationing 
during the sovereign debt crisis. 21
17 Policymakers need an “economic narrative“ to judge the reliability of a forecast scenario; data alone 
are not enough.

5. Conclusions: The Future of Forecasts (and of Errors)
This discussion has highlighted several promising ways to enhance the reliability 
of macroeconomic forecasts – including the systematic analysis of error sources, the 
integration of macroeconomic and microeconomic models, and the use of alternative 
scenarios to account for uncertainty.
Future challenges will require even more advanced tools. It will be crucial to understand 
the impact of long-term trends – such as the green transition – and to harness the 
potential offered by recent advances in data processing.
Artificial intelligence opens up interesting perspectives for modelling complex and  
non-linear dynamics, as has already happened in the field of meteorology. 22 However, 
in the realm of monetary policy, the ability to provide an economic narrative remains 
essential: for this reason, even the most advanced models must be accompanied by 
interpretable and theoretically grounded tools.
Ultimately, forecasting the economy will never be an exact science. Economic agents, 
unlike physical particles, react to policies23, form expectations, and interact strategically.
For this reason, error will always be part of the process, and precisely for this reason, 
models will always be a work in progress.
As a well-known quote has it, “It’s tough to make predictions, especially about the 
future“.24
