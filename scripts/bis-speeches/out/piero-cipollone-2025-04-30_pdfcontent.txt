SPEECH
Navigating a fractured horizon: risks and policy
options in a fragmenting world
Speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the
ECB, at the conference on “Policy challenges in a fragmenting world:
Global trade, exchange rates, and capital flow” organised by the Bank
for International Settlements, the Bank of England, the ECB and the
International Monetary Fund
Frankfurt am Main, 29 April 2025
I’m honoured to welcome you to this conference, jointly organised by the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS), the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).[ ]
Today, we come together to discuss the urgent challenges posed by global fragmentation – a growing risk
to our interconnected world. Earlier this month, the President of the United States announced tariff hikes,
sending shockwaves through the global economy – a stark reminder that the fractures we face are no
longer hypothetical, but real.
This announcement is but the latest chapter in a series of four major shocks that have been reshaping our
world in recent years.
First, since 2018 the intensifying power struggle between the United States and China has led to tit-for-tat
tariffs affecting nearly two-thirds of the trade between these two economic giants. Second, starting in
2020, the pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions to supply chains, which prompted a re-evaluation
of the balance between global integration and resilience. Third, in 2022 Russia's unjustified invasion of
Ukraine not only triggered an energy crisis but also deepened a geopolitical divide that continues to have
worldwide repercussions. And fourth, we are now facing the rising risk of economic fragmentation within
the western bloc itself, as new trade barriers threaten long-standing international partnerships.
The data paint a sobering picture. Geopolitical risk levels have surged to 50% above the post-global
financial crisis average, and uncertainty surrounding trade policy has risen to more than eight times its
average since 2021.[ ] What we are experiencing is not merely a temporary disruption – it is a profound
shift in how nations interact economically, financially and diplomatically. So, it does not come as a surprise
that financial markets have experienced considerable volatility in recent weeks. It remains to be seen if, for
markets to find a stable equilibrium, it will be enough to step back from the current international economic
disorder towards a more stable, predictable and reliable trading system – a development that appears
elusive in the short term. Against this backdrop, recent moves in exchange rates, bond yields and equities,

suggest that US markets have not been playing their usual role as a safe haven in this particular episode
of stress. This potentially has far-reaching longer-term implications for capital flows and the international
financial system.
Today I will focus on three key points. First, we are seeing increasing signs of fragmentation becoming
visible across the economy and financial system. Second, the implications of this accelerating
fragmentation could extend far beyond the immediate disruptions, with consequences for growth, stability
and prosperity. Third, in this evolving economic landscape, central banks must adapt their approaches yet
retain a steadfast focus on their core mandates, while striving to preserve international cooperation.
The emerging reality of fragmentation
Let me begin by addressing a common belief – still held by many until recently – that, despite rising
geopolitical tensions, globalisation appears largely resilient. Headline figures in trade and cross-border
investment, for example, do indeed appear to support this belief. In 2024 world trade expanded to a record
USD 33 trillion – up 3.7% from 2023. Similarly, the global stock of foreign direct investment reached an
unprecedented USD 41 trillion.[ ] However, these surface-level indicators may not reflect the underlying
realities, creating a misleading sense of stability when important changes are already underway. In reality,
fragmentation is already happening in both the global economy and the financial system.
Fragmentation of the real economy
Fragmentation is most evident in rebalancing trade, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions. Take, for
instance, the escalating US-China trade tensions that have been intensifying since 2018. Studies show the
impact of geopolitical distance on trade has become notably negative. A doubling of geopolitical distance
between countries – akin to moving from the position of Germany to that of India in relation to the United
States – decreases bilateral trade flows by approximately 20%.[ ]
The series of shocks to the global economy in recent years have also contributed to this fragmentation.
According to gravity model estimates, trade between geopolitically distant blocs has significantly declined.
Trade between rivals is about 4% lower than it might have been without the heightened tensions post-
2017, while trade between friends is approximately 6% higher.[ ] Global value chains are being
reconfigured as companies respond to these new realities. In 2023 surveys already indicated that only
about a quarter of leading firms operating in the euro area[ ] that sourced critical inputs from countries
considered subject to elevated risk had not developed strategies to reduce their exposure.[ ]
However, these shifting trade patterns have not yet been reflected in overall global trade flows. Non-
aligned countries have played a crucial role as intermediaries, or connectors, helping to sustain global
trade levels even as direct trade between rival blocs declines.[ ] But this stabilising influence is unlikely to
endure as trade fragmentation deepens and geopolitical alliances continue to shift.

The tariffs announced by the US Administration are far-reaching and affect a substantial share of global
trade flows. The effects on the real economy are likely to be material. In its World Economic Outlook,
published last week, the International Monetary Fund revised down global growth projections for 2025-26
by a cumulative 0.8 percentage points and global trade by a cumulative 2.3 percentage points.[ ] This
notably reflects a negative hit from tariffs that ranges between 0.4% to 1% of world GDP by 2027.[ ] In
particular, IMF growth projections for the United States have been revised down by a cumulative 1.3
percentage points in 2025-26. The cumulative impact on euro area growth is smaller, at 0.4 percentage
points.
Financial fragmentation
The fragmentation we are witnessing in global trade is mirrored in the financial sector, where geopolitical
tensions are also reshaping the landscape.
In recent years, global foreign direct investment flows have increasingly aligned with geopolitical divides.
Foreign direct investment in new ventures has plunged by nearly two-thirds between countries from
different geopolitical blocs. However, strong intra-bloc investments have helped sustain overall foreign
direct investment levels globally, masking some of the fragmentation occurring beneath the surface.[ ]
But, as with trade flows, this dynamic is unlikely to persist as geopolitical tensions grow within established
economic blocs. For instance, increased geopolitical distance is shown to curtail cross-border lending. A
two standard deviation rise in geopolitical distance – akin to moving from the position of France to that of
Pakistan in relation to Germany – leads to a reduction of 3 percentage points in cross-border bank
lending.[ ]
The impact of fragmentation in global financial infrastructure is perhaps even more revealing. Since 2014
correspondent banking relationships – crucial for facilitating trade flows across countries – have declined
by 20%. While other factors – such as a wave of concentration in the banking industry, technological
disruptions and profitability considerations – have played a role[ ], the contribution of the geopolitical
dimension can hardly be overstated. The repercussions of this decline can be profound. Research shows
that when correspondent banking relationships are severed in a specific corridor, a firm’s likelihood of
continuing to export between the two countries of that corridor falls by about 5 percentage points in the
short term, and by about 20 percentage points after four years.[ ]
Contributing to this trend, countries such as China, Russia and Iran have launched multiple initiatives to
develop alternatives to established networks such as SWIFT, raising the possibility of a fragmented global
payment system.[ ] Geopolitical alignment now exerts a stronger influence than trade relationships or
technical standards in connecting payment systems between countries.[ ] This poses risks of regional
networks becoming more unstable, increased trade costs and settlement times, and reduced risk sharing
across countries.

Additionally, we are witnessing a noticeable shift away from traditional reserve currencies, with growing
interest in holding gold. Central banks purchased more than 1,000 tonnes of gold in 2024, almost double
the level of the previous decade, with China being the largest purchaser, at over 225 tonnes. At market
valuations, the share of gold in global official reserves has increased, reaching 20% in 2024, while that of
the US dollar has decreased. Survey data suggest that two-thirds of central banks invested in gold to
diversify, 40% to protect against geopolitical risk and 18% because of the uncertainty over the future of the
international monetary system.[ ] There are further signs that geopolitical considerations increasingly
influence decisions to invest in gold. The negative correlation of gold prices with real yields has broken
down since 2022, a phenomenon we have also observed in recent weeks. This suggests that gold prices
have been influenced by more than simply the use of gold to hedge against inflation. Moreover, countries
geopolitically close to China and Russia have seen more pronounced increases in the share of gold in
official foreign reserves since the last quarter of 2021.
The looming consequences of fragmentation
Accelerating fragmentation is resulting in the immediate disruptions we are now seeing, but this is likely to
only be the beginning – potentially profound medium and long-term consequences for growth, stability and
prosperity can be expected.
Medium-term impacts
The initial consequences of fragmentation are already evident in the form of increased uncertainty. In
particular, trade policy uncertainty has led to a broader rise in global economic policy instability, which is
stifling investment and dampening consumption. Our research suggests that the recent increase in trade
policy uncertainty could reduce euro area business investment by 1.1% in the first year and real GDP
growth by around 0.2 percentage points in 2025-26[ ]. Consumer sentiment is also under strain, with the
ECB's Consumer Expectations Survey revealing that rising geopolitical risks are leading to more
pessimistic expectations, higher income uncertainty and ultimately a lower willingness to spend.[ ]
Moreover, ECB staff estimates suggest that the observed increase in financial market volatility might imply
lower GDP growth of about 0.2 percentage points in 2025.
Over the medium term, tariffs are set to have an unambiguously recessionary effect, both for countries
imposing restrictions and those receiving them. The costs are particularly high when exchange rates fail to
absorb tariff shocks, and some evidence suggests exchange rates have become less effective in this role.
[ ]
The Eurosystem’s analysis of potential fragmentation scenarios suggests that such trade disruptions could
turn out to be significant. In the case of a mild decoupling between the western (United States-centric) and
the eastern (China-centric) bloc, where trade between East and West reverts to the level observed in the
mid-1990s, global output could drop by close to 2%.[ ] In the more extreme case of a severe decoupling –
essentially a halt to trade flows – between the two blocs, global output could drop by up to 9%. Trade-
17
18
19
20
21

dependent nations would bear the brunt of these trade shocks, with China potentially suffering losses of
between 5% and 20%, and the EU seeing declines ranging from 2.4% to 9.5% in the mild and severe
decoupling scenarios respectively. The analysis also shows that the United States would be more
significantly affected if it imposed additional trade restrictions against western and neutral economies –
with real GDP losses of almost 11% in the severe decoupling scenario – whereas EU losses would
increase only slightly in such a case.[ ]
The inflationary effects of trade fragmentation are more uncertain. They depend mainly on the response of
exchange rates, firms’ markups and wages. Moreover, they are not distributed equally. While higher import
costs and the ensuing price pressures are likely to drive up inflation in the countries raising tariffs, the
impact is more ambiguous in other countries as a result of the tariffs’ global recessionary effects, which
push down demand and commodity prices, as well as of the possible dumping of exports from countries
with overcapacity. The short to medium-term effects may even prove disinflationary for the euro area,
where real rates have increased and the euro has appreciated following US tariff announcements.
In fact, a key feature of most model-based assessments is that higher US tariffs lead to a depreciation of
currencies against the US dollar, moderating the inflationary effect for the United States and amplifying it
for other countries. But so far we have seen the opposite: the risk-off sentiment in response to US tariff
announcements and economic policy uncertainty have led to capital flows away from the United States,
depreciating the dollar and putting upward pressure on US bond yields. Conversely, the euro area
benefited from safe haven flows, with the euro appreciating and nominal bond yields decreasing.
Long-term structural changes
The long-term consequences of economic fragmentation are inherently difficult to predict, but by drawing
on historical examples and recognising emerging trends, it’s clear that we are on the verge of significant
structural changes. Two areas stand out.
The first one is structurally lower growth. On this point, international economic literature has reached an
overwhelming consensus.[ ] Quantitatively, point estimates might vary. For example, research of 151
countries spanning more than five decades of the 20th century reveals that higher tariffs have typically led
to lower economic growth. This is largely due to key production factors – labour and capital – being
redirected into less productive sectors.[ ]
However, data from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a period which tariff supporters often look back
to, seem to tell a different story. At that time, trade barriers across countries were high – the US effective
tariff rate, for example, reached almost 60%, twice as high as after the 2 April tariffs. And sometimes
countries imposing higher trade barriers enjoyed higher growth, which may provide motivation for current
policymakers' trade tariff policies. But these episodes need to be read in historical context. Before 1913,
tariffs mostly shielded manufacturing, a high-productivity sector at the time, attracting labour from other,
less productive sectors, like agriculture. Therefore, their negative effects were mitigated by the expansion
of industries at the frontier of technological innovation. Moreover, the interwar years offer further nuance –
22
23
24

the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the 1930s had relatively limited direct effects on US growth, mainly because
trade accounted for just 5% of the economy.
But today’s tariffs are unlikely to replicate the positive effects seen in the 19th century. Instead, they risk
creating the same inefficiencies observed in the course of the 20th century, by diverting resources from
high-productivity sectors to lower-productivity ones. This contractionary effect could lead to persistently
lower global growth rates. In fact, the abolition of trade barriers within the EU and the international efforts
towards lower trade barriers in the second half of the 20th century were a direct response to the economic
and political impact of protectionism,[ ] which had played a key role in worsening and prolonging the
Great Depression[ ] and had contributed to the formation of competing blocs in the run-up to the Second
World War.[ ]
The second long-term shift driven by fragmentation might be the gradual transition from a US-dominated,
global system to a more multipolar one, where multiple currencies compete for reserve status. For
example, if the long-term implications of higher tariffs materialise, notably in the form of higher inflation,
slower growth and higher US debt, this could undermine confidence in the US dollar’s dominant role in
international trade and finance.[ ] Combined with a further disengagement from global geopolitical affairs
and military alliances, this could, over time, undermine the “exorbitant privilege” enjoyed by the United
States, resulting in higher interest rates domestically.[ ]
Moreover, as alternative payment systems gain traction, regional currencies may start to emerge as
reserves within their respective blocs. This could be accompanied by the rise of competing payment
systems, further fragmenting global financial flows and international trade. Such shifts would increase
transaction costs and erode the capacity of countries to share risks on a global scale, making the world
economy more fragmented and less efficient.
The central bank's role in a fragmented world
So, as these tectonic shifts reshape the global economic landscape, central banks must adapt their
approaches while remaining steadfast in their core mandates. The challenges posed by fragmentation
require a delicate balance between confronting new realities and working to preserve the benefits of an
integrated global economy. In order to navigate the present age of fragmentation, it is necessary to take
action in four key areas.
First, central banks must focus on understanding and monitoring fragmentation. Traditional
macroeconomic models often assume seamless global integration and may not fully capture the dynamics
of a fragmenting world. Enhanced analytical frameworks that incorporate geopolitical factors and how
businesses adjust to these risks will be essential for accurate forecasting and effective policy formulation.
The Eurosystem is reflecting on these issues.
Second, monetary policy must adapt to the new nature of supply shocks generated by fragmentation. The
effects of the greater frequency, size and more persistent nature of fragmentation-induced shocks and
25
26
27
28
29

their incidence on prices require a careful calibration of our monetary responses. In this respect, our
communication needs to acknowledge the uncertainty and trade-offs we face while giving a clear sense of
how we will react depending on the incoming data. This can be done by making use of scenario
analysis and providing clarity about our reaction function, as emphasised recently by President Lagarde.
[ ]
Third, instead of building walls, we must forge unity. Even as political winds shift, central banks should
strengthen international cooperation where possible. Through forums such as those provided by the BIS
and the Financial Stability Board, we can keep open channels of cooperation that transcend borders. Our
work on cross-border payments stands as proof of this commitment in line with the G20 Roadmap[ ]. The
ECB is pioneering a cross-currency settlement service through TARGET Instant Payment Settlement
(TIPS) – initially linking the euro, the Swedish krona and the Danish krone. We are exploring connections
between TIPS and other fast-payment systems globally, both bilaterally and on the basis of a multilateral
network such as the BIS’ Project Nexus.[ ]
And fourth, central banks must enhance their capacity to address financial stability risks arising from
fragmentation. The potential for sudden stops in capital flows, payment disruptions and volatility in
currency markets requires robust contingency planning and crisis management frameworks. Global
financial interlinkages and spillovers highlight the importance of preserving and further reinforcing the
global financial safety net so that we can swiftly and effectively address financial stress, which is more
likely to emerge in a fragmenting world.[ ]
In fact, the lesson from the 1930s is that international coordination is key to avoiding protectionist snowball
effects, where tit-for-tat trade barriers multiply as each country seeks to direct spending to merchandise
produced at home rather than abroad.[ ] In order to avoid this, the G20 countries committed to preserving
open trade could call an international trade conference to avoid beggar-thy-neighbour policies[ ] and
instead agree on other measures, such as macroeconomic policies that can support the global economy in
this period of uncertainty and contribute to reduce global imbalances.
Let me finally emphasise that the current situation also has important implications for the euro area. If the
EU upholds its status as a reliable partner that defends trade openness, investor protection, the rule of law
and central bank independence, the euro has the potential to play the role of a global public good. This
requires a deep, trusted market for internationally accepted euro debt securities. That is why policy efforts
to integrate and deepen European capital markets must go hand in hand with efforts to issue European
safe assets.[ ]
Conclusion
Let me conclude.
As we stand at this crossroads of global fragmentation, we must confront an uncomfortable truth: we are
drifting toward a fractured economic and financial landscape where trust is eroded and alliances are
30

strained.
Central banks now face a double challenge: to be an anchor of stability in turbulent economic waters while
reimagining their role in a world where multiple economic blocs are forming. The question is not whether
we adapt, but how we mitigate the costs of fragmentation without sacrificing the potential of global
integration.
Our greatest risk lies not in the shocks we anticipate, but in the alliances we neglect, the innovations we
overlook and the common ground we fail to find. The future of global prosperity hinges on our ability to use
fragmentation as a catalyst to reinvent the common good.
