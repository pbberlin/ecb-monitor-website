ESM, Luxembourg — 2 October 2025
Speech by Francois Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Banque de
France


Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a great pleasure to speak before you today in Luxembourg. | would
like to express my sincere gratitude to my friend Pierre Gramegna,
Managing Director of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Luxembourg holds a unique place in the history of European integration.
It is the birthplace of Robert Schuman. But it is less known that, in 1963,
Luxembourg listed the world’s first international bond denominated in a
foreign currency, an innovation that helped finance one of the most
strategic projects of its time: the Autostrada del Sole, linking northern
and southern Italy.
Since 1963, much progress has been made in facilitating cross-border
financing, and we managed together the tremendous success of the
euro: let me pay tribute here to Pierre Werner and his 1970 report. Yet,
dramatic changes in the new world order over the past three years call
for a bold step forward to strengthen the international role of the euro.

The US administration's aggressive protectionist stance and defiant
attitude toward international cooperation are increasing global
uncertainty and fragmentation. Confidence in the dollar as the safe-
haven currency could be reviewed by market players. | Financial
innovations, like stablecoins, may change the dynamics of the
international monetary and financial system." Some consider that our
international system is at risk of falling into the “Kindleberger trap”,
li with no clear hegemonic power acting as a stabilizer and public goods
provider.
As dramatic and dark as these changes may seem, we are fortunate to
face them having the euro, and they are an opportunity for our currency.
'’ We shall not be naive in believing that the euro will replace the US
dollar soon. Let me also be clear: promoting the international role of the
euro does not mean expecting its exchange rate to rise. We have no
exchange rate target, but we are very attentive to the possible effects of
a stronger euro on the inflation outlook.
Surprisingly, this international role was not stipulated in the objectives of
the European treaties as the euro was originally created for internal
purposes. Yet, the reasons that led the ECB until recently to favour a
neutral stance on the euro's global role, notably the fear of losing control
over monetary policy, are no longer valid. In her seminal speech in Berlin
last May, President Lagarde mentioned three key factors to reach the full
potential of a “global euro” Y : (i) geopolitical credibility, (ii) legal and
institutional integrity, and (iii) economic resilience. As my colleague José
Luis Escriva recently put it, there is a chance to move toward an
international monetary system that relies less on one single global
currency. “! Today, | will focus on the economic pillar and the relevant
tools we can use to enhance the international role of the euro. The
debate is no longer about the strategic “why’, it is about the practical
“how.
| will first discuss how increasing the external appeal of our single
currency goes in parallel with strengthening internal integration (I).
Second, | will share some remarks on how we can make progress on
issuance of a European safe asset (Il).
l. Strengthen internal integration to
boost external attractivity


First emergency: Single market and Savings and Investments Union
| firmly believe that the attractiveness of our currency ultimately stems
from deepening integration within our Union. In this respect, there is a
‘happy coincidence’ between the Eurosystem's internal objectives and
the external dimension of the euro. “' Deeper, more attractive and easier
to navigate European capital markets would encourage savings to stay
here in Europe, strengthen the financing of our companies and boost
their innovation and competitiveness. This in turn would drive greater
demand for euro-denominated assets and bolster the euro’s international
role. To this end, our task is clearly defined: completing the Single
market and establishing a genuine Savings and Investments Union (SIU),
as outlined in the Letta and Draghi reports. V"".
26 years after having established our monetary sovereignty, it is high
time to complete our economic sovereignty and financial sovereignty.
One practical and yet critical step is to set a clear, "mobilizing" deadline
ix Jacques Delors succeeded when he set 1 January 1993 as the
deadline for the Single market and 1 January 1999 for the single
currency. Why don’t the Commission and the Council put forward now
such a comprehensive package, with a clear implementation date? The
1/1/2028 would be thirty-five years after the single market. But, if we
don’t react fast, we are at serious risk that the window of opportunity will
close. This is my strong call in Luxembourg, perhaps the last possible
call.
Let me sum up the crucial mobilisation with three ‘i's.’ * .


| STRENGTHEN INTERNAL INTEGRATION TO BOOST EXTERNAL ATTRACTIVITY
3 IMPERATIVES FOR BEEFING UP
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY
integrate the single market more
- Remove internal barriers
in different sectors: services,
energy, defence
invest better innovate faster
- Focus on investments - Less bureaucracy
in disruptive technologies - More technology including
- Create the Savings in currency and payments
and Investments Union
2 ESM + 2 OCTOBER 2025 BANQUE DE FRANCE
European Stability Mechanism - Luxembourg
First, we need to integrate the Single market more. In purchasing power
terms, our single market is worth EUR 17.9 trillion, which makes it nearly
as big as that of the US (EUR 18.4 trillion*'). However, it is less attractive
because it remains still fragmented.
Second, Europe must /nvest and save better. The euro area household
saving ratio is more than 15% of gross disposable income, which is 4
points higher than in the US (11% of GDI). *". This financial windfall is
insufficiently channelled into European corporate equity financing. Non-
financial corporation (NFC) equity financing amounts to just 85% of GDP
in the euro area, compared to 220% of GDP in the United States. This is
one of the main reasons why Europe lags behind on innovation, and still
more on disruptive innovation. We need to beef up European venture
capital. Between 2014 and 2025, venture capital funds raised the
equivalent of 0.39% of GDP in the United States, compared to 0.07% for
European players.

To turn ideas into actions and to focus on equity, | propose to prioritize
five levers, out of the 21 proposed in the Commission roadmap. The
order does not matter, but all of them must be launched unconditionally
and urgently:
(i) a genuine European supervisory framework for investment funds to
accelerate the scale-up from national to “pan-European” funds.
(ii) the creation of an optional “28th regime” with a common EU-wide set
of business law rules with the aim of lowering administrative costs for
firms doing business in several EU countries. Although certain questions
remain, the Commission consultation on the subject is a promising step
forward.
(iii) the gradual development of European retirement savings and
pension funds.
(iv) the implementation of ambitious public-private partnerships.
Drawing on the experience of the EIB and its European Tech Champions
Initiative (ETC), we should leverage private investors in the venture
Capital market by public funds.
(v) introducing European retail investment products through
simplification and standardization. The Commission is already working
on a blueprint for a European savings product.
Third, we need to innovate faster. Less bureaucracy, but also more
technology including in our core business of currency. The rapid surge of
stablecoins in USD, dominated by American players, *"" raises the risk
that our money will become “privatised” and “de-Europeanised.” In this
context, the creation of a wholesale central bank digital currency
(CBDC), as well as a digital euro for retail, are both urgently needed, not
only to strengthen our economic and financial sovereignty, but also
enhance the global standing of the euro.
Some additional paths to leverage the euro
Beyond the Single market and the SIU, we must also explore other paths.
Giving greater prominence to invoicing in euros is one of them. Excluding


US exports and intra-euro area trade, around 60% of global exports are
invoiced in US dollars and less than 25% in euros. *'¥

European Stability Mechanism - Luxembourg


Admittedly, invoicing denomination stems largely from private and
complex decisions *” , and exhibits a persistent pattern. *TM' Still,
geopolitical alignment plays a role in this choice, as China illustrates with
the renminbi. We could leverage EU negotiations with trade partners that
have been hit hard by America’s new protectionist measures (e.g. India,
Switzerland, Indonesia).
Furthermore, some of our actions as Eurosystem can make euro
invoicing more attractive. The provision of euro liquidity lines to non-euro
area central banks (so called EUREP) can be expanded further, which,
together with deeper capital markets, would make it more attractive for
firms and banks to fund and invoice their commercial activities in euros.
xvliln addition, pushing forward the use of central bank digital money for
wholesale transactions on distributed ledger platforms could also
contribute to facilitating trade denominated in euros. *“"' Central banks
along with the ECB are also working to make cross-border payments
faster and more efficient by connecting instant payment systems across
jurisdictions.** Today TARGET services already accept other currencies
such as those of Sweden and Denmark; tomorrow they should be
interconnected to India, Switzerland, but also in my view possibly UK,
Canada or Brazil.
Ultimately, we must reinforce the virtuous cycle between growth, size of
capital markets, and international currency use.TM* But, on top of this, a
sufficient amount of safe assets helps create a reliable environment for
investors, even in times of stress. This virtuous circle explains the rise of
the US dollar since the end of World War Il. Europe has the potential to
set in motion a similar self-reinforcing cycle. But this will be much more
powerful if we promote deep and liquid markets for European safe
assets.
lil. A catalyst for the international role
of the euro: developing the market
safe assets.


Let me say upfront that advocating for a European safe asset does not
and cannot mean advocating for fiscal indiscipline or mutualization.
There is little doubt that fiscal consolidation must take place and can be
achieved in Member States where it is needed, starting with my own
country. As my colleague Joachim Nagel noted, this will improve
sovereign bond ratings and thus the amount of national assets perceived
as safe. **!
Let's face it: there is a relative scarcity of safe assets in Europe.

European Stability Mechanism - Luxembourg


Even when combining supranational debt (a little over 1 USD trillion) with
sovereign bonds rated at least AA in the Euro area [S&P] (almost 9 USD
trillion), the total amounts to barely 33% of U.S. Treasuries (over USD 30
trillion). How can we expand the supply of European safe assets? There
is no silver bullet, but broadly speaking we have three main levers at our
disposal: %'
A. Merging existing supranational debt
B. Transforming existing national sovereign debt into genuine European
sovereign debt
C. Creating and rolling over new supranational debt
Each option involves a trade-off between feasibility and ambition. Let me
briefly dig into each of them.
image ImageThématique Money Catégorie Speech
European Stability Mechanism - Luxembourg


A. Merging existing supranational debt (Commission, ESM, EIB) may
appear straightforward. The impact in terms of size would be limited —
on aggregate it would amount to around € 1.2 trillion — but the signalling
effect would be powerful. It would nevertheless require addressing some
legal complexities, as these are institutions with different legal
foundations. To circumvent the latter, an option may be to purchase or to
pool these securities and issue a common Eurobond in exchange, with a
common debt agent. And this brings us to the next set of options:
transforming existing debt.
B. We could transform part of sovereign debt into supranational debt
(or, even better, into genuine European sovereign debt) through financial
engineering. **'" Various solutions have been proposed since the euro
area crisis and, in some cases, have even been put in draft legal texts.
These essentially involve pooling or withdrawing a large share of
sovereign bonds, issuing Eurobonds in exchange, and introducing
seniority structures to ringfence a “safe” tranche against default risk**"” .
This “partial transformation” would help to create more European safe
assets without adding to the EU's fiscal burden: up to €6 trillion in
supranational bonds in the Euro area, **Y together with the remaining
AA-rated sovereign bonds.
The “blue/red bonds” option, proposed in 2010 by Delpla and von
Weizsacker and more recently by Blanchard and Ubide **“' consists in
replacing part of sovereign debt by supranational “blue bonds” issued by
the EU (up to 25% of the aggregate GDP), backed by Member States’ tax
revenues, and ranked legally senior to national “red bonds.”. Appealing as
it looks, it raises some issues, for instance about the coordination
between national and supranational debt issuers during the “transition”
period, or the liquidity of remaining “red bonds” as the market share of
“blue bonds” gradually increases.
A second financial engineering option, the so-called “ESBies”, has been
proposed among others by Brunnermeier.**”" It consists in a
securitisation arrangement that would, in principle, be easier to
implement than capital-based structures like a European Debt Agen
xxvill Rabranded as sovereign bond-backed securities (SBBS), a proposal
was put forward by the Commission in 2018. While this initiative was met
at the time with limited support, it is worth revisiting it with fresh eyes.
C. Last but not least, a feasible step to strengthen the supply of


European safe assets is to build on and enhance existing EU
frameworks, such as SURE and NGEU. *“'*" The launch of the NGEU
programme in 2021 marked a milestone in European debt markets. The
Commission's recent measures (a unified funding approach, the launch
of repo facilities)“* are fostering a more complete and integrated EU-
bond market. Investors’ appetite has been strong, with EU-bonds quickly
gaining recognition as a credible benchmark asset for international
investors. A (limited) possible start would be to roll over the existing
NGEU debt, rather than reimbursing it from 2028.
The main advantage of leveraging the success of NGEU lies in its
comparative technical simplicity. We are talking about plain vanilla
bonds, that are widely accepted by markets. Politically, it remains more
challenging: some may consider that aiming for a common debt is not
timely when some large Member States face strained public finances. As
said, this should not be seen as a license for some countries to free-ride.
Rather, joint debt should be issued to fund only investments that raise
potential growth and finance European public goods. We could consider,
for example, some EU-bonds issuance earmarked for financing the new
needs in defence infrastructures and their industrial integration
XXxi replicating the NGEU model.
Let me sum up and look ahead. All the options | have just highlighted are
worth our renewed attention. May I, here in Luxembourg, revisit the
spirit that guided Pierre Werner in 1970, and later Jacques Delors, who
drew inspiration from it in his 1989 report, and take three lessons from
them?
1. First, to set a clear long-term ambition: for them, it was a single
currency; for us today, it is the creation of a euro-denominated safe
asset.
2. Second, to accept pragmatic steps along the way: | propose that
begin by exploring various avenues for developing euro safe assets
each of which would significantly increase the volume available. If
several coexist for a time, they may later converge. But if none exist
within three years — the duration of the first phase of the Werner Plan —
the consequences would be far more serious.
3. Third, to stay the course regardless of international monetary


turbulence — and precisely because of it. We all know that the Werner
Plan had to contend with the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in
1971... yet it remained, albeit with extended timelines, the inspiration
behind the EMS and later the EMU.
Today, we do not face at this stage the same kind of international
monetary crisis, but we no longer have more flexibility with timelines.
This must be Europe’s moment — and the euro’s moment. It is now or
never: emerging currencies will not wait for us.
Let’s come back to the first Eurobonds issued here in 1963. The truth is
that these bonds were denominated in dollars at the time. Our challenge
today is to develop true Eurobonds, i.e. bonds issued in euros at the
European level and that are seen as sovereign bonds.
Financing tools carry with them more than financial capacity. They
materialize a vision. Today, we are once again called upon to show our
spirit of ambition. Our Union now faces even greater challenges, which
demand collective solutions — from defence and security to the green
and digital transitions. And our Union must complement its monetary
sovereignty with economic and financial sovereignty.
By completing this unfinished work, we would not only honour the
pioneering spirit of Robert Schuman and the founding fathers, but even
more serve well our fellow European citizens by building confidence in
our shared future.

tranche [ 14.5*0.6*0.7 = €6.1 Tn]. In turn, following the proposal blue/red
by Blanchard and Ubide (2025), up to 25% of EA GDP would be “blue”, i.e.
€3.6 Tn (a share large enough to get a liquid market but still leaving an
important portion of “red” bonds as a buffer to make blue bonds safe).
