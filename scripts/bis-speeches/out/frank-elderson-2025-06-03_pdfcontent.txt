SPEECH
Nature’s bell tolls for thee, economy!
Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of
the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the
Naturalis Biodiversity Center
Leiden, 22 May 2025
Thank you for inviting me to speak at this annual biodiversity dinner. The wide range of speakers here this
evening – on international biodiversity day – is testament to the relevance of biodiversity across
disciplines.
Nature isn’t just the roots and shoots of biologists, macroecologists and natural scientists. Beyond its
intrinsic value, nature provides vital services that are relevant for all of us – for entrepreneurs, workers,
policymakers and bankers, but also for central bankers and financial supervisors.
A thriving natural environment provides vital benefits that sustain our well-being and serve as a crucial
driving force for the global economy. Think of fertile soils, pollination, timber, fishing stocks, clean water
and clean air.
But we are well aware of the daunting facts that confirm the dire state of ecosystem services. Intensive
land use, the climate crisis, pollution, overexploitation and other human pressures are rapidly and severely
damaging our natural resources.
75% of land surface ecosystems and 66% of ocean ecosystems have been damaged, degraded or
modified.
We are using natural resources 1.7 times faster than ecosystems can regenerate them. Consequently, the
contribution that nature can make to our economies – and our way of life – is steadily diminishing every
day.
These fateful facts and figures confront us as vividly as Edvard Munch’s iconic scream. Yet, accounting for
nature and the services it provides is challenging. What nature provides to the economy is typically not
measured directly in statistics like GDP.
We price portfolios instead of pollinators, we monitor markets instead of mangroves and we watch wages
instead of water supplies. However, the reality is that while our economies are heavily reliant on
ecosystem services, the economic value of those pollinators, mangroves and water supplies is not
sufficiently taken into account.
Nature is too often still wrongly seen as a free good, readily available and abundant in supply, without
opportunity costs. For such a good, there is no market – and therefore no price.

So, why can’t governments intervene by pricing and creating a market for nature as has been done for
emissions?
Unlike for the climate crisis – which can be quantified through carbon emissions and their direct links to
rising temperatures – there is no single metric that can be used to quantify the wide range of ecosystem
services.
What is the common denominator of clean air, fertile soils and coasts protected by mangrove forests?
Nature is beautifully complex, but this complexity makes it harder to establish a market for nature than a
market for climate, such as the carbon markets created through emissions trading systems.
For central banks to effectively fulfil their mandates, we need to enhance our capacity to measure the vital
services that nature provides to our economy and identify the financial risks caused by the degradation of
these services. And while this is admittedly not an easy task, it is encouraging that multiple stakeholders
are making progress, including academia, firms and also the ECB. We are enhancing our tools,
methodologies and data to assess the economic implications of ecosystems and their degradation. And I
am pleased to be able to share some of our latest insights this evening.
I will argue that while nature services may appear to be freely available, they are in fact not abundant at all
and there are substantial costs to using and losing them. Costs that we currently overlook when headlines
report on GDP growth.
Accounting for nature in monetary policy and banking supervision
Nature being of vital importance for the economy and the financial system is hardly a novel insight.
Besides scientists, a number of central banks and prudential supervisors have also been highlighting their
interlinkages for several years now.[ ] And while the climate crisis has received most of the attention, it is
encouraging that work on nature-related risks has also significantly evolved.
Moreover, the ECB has taken significant steps to account for nature-related risks in the pursuit of its
mandate. For instance, we take into account the effects nature degradation can have on banks’ balance
sheets. The degradation of nature could damage companies’ production processes and consequently
weaken their creditworthiness, which might in turn impair loans granted by banks. In our role as the
supervisor of Europe’s largest banks, we therefore aim to ensure that the banks we supervise adequately
manage both climate-related and nature-related risks.[ ] Encouragingly, we are seeing a growing set of
good practices among the banks we supervise in terms of identifying, quantifying and managing nature-
related risks.
But are we fully aware of – and sufficiently alert to – how nature degradation could eventually hit balance
sheets?
Advancing our understanding does not mean that economists and supervisors should start studying ants
in Aragon, ladybirds in Lombardy or honeybees in Holland (although it is very important that entomologists
do!).

Instead, central banks and supervisors need to gain a better understanding of just how vulnerable the
economy and the financial system are to nature degradation.[ ]
Capturing the risks related to ecosystem degradation
An ECB study in 2023 found that nearly 75% of banks’ corporate lending goes to firms that are highly
dependent on at least one ecosystem service.[ ] This finding underscores just how interconnected nature,
the economy and the financial system really are.[ ] But that study does not tell us exactly how much of our
economic activity is at risk, or which economic sectors and regions will be most affected.
To better understand this impact, the ECB has teamed up with the Resilient Planet Finance Lab at the
University of Oxford.
The interdisciplinary team has developed systemic risk indicators that move beyond dependency analysis
to a comprehensive assessment of nature-related financial risks. In essence, this indicator assesses the
economic implications of the deteriorating state of ecosystems. It shows how much of the economic value
added by a particular industry– what economists call “gross value added” – is at risk when ecosystem
services degrade. Tomorrow we will publish a blog post showing some of the preliminary results of our
work, but I can already share some findings with you this evening.
Water – the natural currency underwriting purchases, investments and
trades
Our preliminary findings indicate two things. First, water – too little, too much or too dirty water that is –has
been identified as posing the most significant risk to the euro area economy. Losses related to water
scarcity, poor water quality and flood protection emerge as the most critical from a value added
perspective. Concretely, surface water scarcity alone puts almost 15% of the euro area’s economic output
at risk. This is not surprising because water is not just any resource – it is one of the most essential natural
resources we possess. Second, agriculture is the most exposed sector, as it would suffer the largest
proportional output losses due to a decline in surface water. But other sectors are also likely to be
significantly affected.

Water is, for instance, an indispensable resource in industry. In the Netherlands, industry alone uses over
2.6 trillion litres of fresh water a year.[ ] This water usage is more than three times the total annual water
consumption of all households in the Netherlands. Water is also essential for energy production, not only
in hydropower plants but also in thermal power plants – including nuclear – where it is used for cooling
and steam generation. It is consumed in vast quantities for mining and mineral processing, which are
crucial for the energy transition, as well as in the construction sector for producing concrete, to name just a
few examples.
The risk posed by water scarcity is not hypothetical, we are already experiencing the impact today. I am
sure that many of you remember when the summers of 2018, 2019 and 2020 brought severe droughts and
heatwaves even to the Netherlands. In 2018 alone, economic losses in the Netherlands were up to €1.9
billion for agriculture and €155 million for shipping, with widespread but hard-to-quantify damage to
ecosystems. This year’s drought is especially alarming: spring 2025 is on track to become the driest ever
recorded in the Netherlands, likely surpassing the previous record set nearly 50 years ago. And droughts
are only projected to increase further as the climate crisis continues to develop. Worryingly, in the driest
scenario an average summer in the 2040s will be about as dry as an extremely dry summer now.
Effective water management will thus be crucial for sustaining production. However, the risk persists that
during periods of drought, production might need to be scaled down. Some industrial processes may
become economically unviable and might need to relocate.
For example, some have even gone as far as to point at a risk that more frequent droughts could render
traditional tulip-growing regions such as the Bollenstreek unsuitable for bulb cultivation.[ ] This may
compel growers to explore better-positioned locations where water is more reliably available to safeguard
the iconic Dutch tulip industry.

Hence, as a consequence of water scarcity, our economies could produce less, and production costs are
likely to rise during any inevitable transition phase.
Let me also point out that biodiversity is a critical – and often underestimated – factor in ensuring the
availability and quality of fresh water. Ecosystems such as forests and wetlands regulate the quantity,
timing and purity of water flows by stabilising soils and filtering pollutants. Maintaining healthy and diverse
ecosystems will be crucial for resilient water provisioning as climate change intensifies, particularly in
regions facing growing water stress.
Beyond these macroeconomic impacts, ecosystem degradation can significantly affect financial stability,
for example through the loans that banks grant to households and firms. In essence, the greater the
impact on firms, the higher the risk of defaults and the higher the risk on banks’ balance sheets.
For example, in our research with the University of Oxford we found that more than 34% of banks’ total
outstanding nominal amount – over €1.3 trillion – is currently extended to sectors exposed to high water
scarcity risk.
As the next step in our research, we will examine changes in the probability of default in the sectors most
affected by dwindling ecosystems. Think about it as stress-testing the resilience of banks’ credit portfolios
to nature degradation. We plan to publish these results later this year, complete with a more in-depth
analysis on the topic, so stay tuned.
Multiple stakeholders are taking action
Encouragingly, our work with the University of Oxford is not an isolated case. We are in fact seeing a wide
range of stakeholders taking action to better account for ecosystem services.
For instance, I hear that our host this evening – the Naturalis Biodiversity Center – has teamed up with
banks to combine insights from science and finance to further develop indicators quantifying ecosystem
services.
We are also seeing a growing set of good practices among the banks we supervise in terms of identifying,
quantifying and managing nature-related risks. Banks typically conduct materiality assessments to
understand where they are most affected. And banks also grapple with the challenge that nature-related
risks are difficult to express in a single metric. Once they know where they are exposed, they then typically
conduct deep dives on specific topics.
One bank, for example, has conducted a quantitative scenario analysis to understand how the profitability
of its customers could be affected if a water pollution tax were to be implemented.
Other banks design customer scorecards and engage with the most vulnerable counterparties, sometimes
offering small discounts or other incentives when customers meet key performance indicators that
increase their resilience.
It is also encouraging that progress is being made at the international level. The Network for Greening the
Financial System (NGFS) – a network of 145 central banks and supervisors from around the world – has
developed a conceptual framework offering central banks and supervisors a common understanding of

nature-related financial risks and a principle-based risk assessment approach.[ ][ ] And the Financial
Stability Board recently took stock of supervisory and regulatory initiatives among its members, finding that
a growing number of financial authorities are considering the potential implications of nature-related risks
for the financial sector.[ ]
So scientists, banks, policymakers and supervisors are in fact taking action. That’s good news. Given the
high level of uncertainty regarding impacts, non-linearities, tipping points and irreversibility, continuous
scientific input and engagement are essential to determine the transmission channels from nature to our
economies.
Reliable and comparable data are key to managing risks and
identifying opportunities
Before I conclude, let me stress a vital enabler to better measure ecosystem services: data. Closer
cooperation with natural scientists can help us better understand the data they have available on the
status of nature and the ecosystem services it provides. The National Hub for Biodiversity Information
provided by our host tonight is an excellent example.[ ]
Moreover, continuous engagement with the scientific community can also help improve our understanding
of non-linearities, tipping points and the irreversibility of the biodiversity crisis.
Similarly, the availability of reliable and comparable data from companies is essential for us to know where
the risks are hiding and where opportunities can be found. Such data can, for example, provide insights
into companies’ reliance on fresh water for their production processes. In this context, the reporting
requirements in the EU’s sustainable finance framework are not merely a “nice to have”, they are providing
indispensable information about financial risks and are a solution to the patchwork of different reporting
criteria.
Does that mean that there is no room for simplification? Does it mean that there is no room to ease the
reporting burden on smaller firms?
Of course not.
As the ECB noted in its recent opinion[ ] on the Commission’s omnibus package, striking the right
balance is crucial – the balance between how much data firms report and how many firms are required to
do so. Excluding too many firms from the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive may reduce the
availability of vital data needed to assess climate-and nature related financial risks.
So when carefully calibrating a balanced degree of simplification, one should look at what data points we
need most and make sure that sufficient companies report on precisely those data. Not only because
reliable and comparable data are important for identifying economic impacts and managing financial risks,
but also because such data helps identify investment opportunities to unlock a clean, green and
competitive European economy.

Conclusion
Let me conclude.
Encouragingly, multiple stakeholders are making progress in better accounting for ecosystem services.
That’s good news, and this work must continue. Because dwindling ecosystems are no longer peripheral –
they are central to financial stability, the economy and, ultimately, our daily lives.
When you saw the title of my remarks this evening, some of you might have recognised a reference to
John Donne’s poem “For Whom the Bell Tolls”. Donne beautifully expresses that we are all part of a bigger
whole: “No man is an island, Entire of itself.”
Nor is our economy an island – it is not “entire of itself”, it depends on nature.
If nature’s services suffer,
And they do!
Send not to know
For whom the bell tolls.
It tolls for thee, ECOnomy!
Thank you for your attention.

Last year the NGFS published a report on nature-related litigation to raise awareness among financial
institutions, central banks and supervisors. The report highlighted that while nature-related litigation is still
in its infancy, the number of cases is expected to grow rapidly. This trend underlines the real risk of doing
too little for governments, companies, banks, central banks and supervisors. See Network for Greening
