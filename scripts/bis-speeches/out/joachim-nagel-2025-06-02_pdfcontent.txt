1 Certain uncertainty
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Thank you very much for your invitation and kind welcome. I am delighted to be
with you here in Mannheim today.
With this series of events, the
ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung GmbH) has been providing
a forum for political, economic and academic exchange for more than three
decades now. You have set out your expectations very clearly: “Pressing eco‐
nomic policy issues and recent developments are the focus.”
At present, pressing issues and developments are indeed coming thick and fast.
Take, for example, the numerous pivots in trade policy by the US (United States)
Administration. Sometimes the issues are already outdated before you have
even had a chance to address them. In any case, one thing is clear: we have a lot
to discuss today.

5 Conclusion

Ladies and gentlemen,
When the ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung GmbH) proposed
a topic to me just over two months ago, I had no doubt in my mind: there was no
chance that the chosen topic would already be outdated. And why not? As Alan
Greenspan, former Chairman of the US (United States) Federal Reserve, once
said: “Uncertainty is not just an important feature of the monetary policy land‐
scape; it is the deﬁning characteristic of that landscape.”
Greenspan said this in 2003. The term “the Great Moderation” had just been
coined to describe a period of exceptional macroeconomic stability.
Uncertainty seemed to be relatively low at that time. Nevertheless, Greenspan
stressed the factor of uncertainty. And he is not alone in this. I would imagine
that none of you have ever heard a central banker say that uncertainty is cur‐
rently negligible. 
From my own experience, I can conﬁrm that, when making monetary policy deci‐
sions, we are always faced with uncertainty. It is, after all, in the nature of the
matter: the decisions impact a future that cannot be precisely predicted. Dealing
with uncertainty is therefore part of the job description of monetary policymak‐
ers. What is constantly changing are the causes and degree of uncertainty. And
that brings us to the heart of today’s topic: European monetary policy in times of
high uncertainty. 
In my lecture today, I will address three key questions: How should monetary
policy deal with uncertainty in general? What are the main causes of uncertainty
at present and in the future? How is monetary policy in the euro area navigating
the current period of high uncertainty?
2 Monetary policy under uncertainty
Let us start with the subject that we have just touched upon: the impact of mon‐
etary policy unfolds only gradually. The decisions of today aﬀect the inﬂation of
tomorrow. The gap between decisions and their impact necessitates a forward-
looking approach. Or, to put it another way: when we are out in the monetary
policy landscape, we are also looking to our more distant surroundings. 
[1]
[2]

This means that a core part of preparing for monetary policy meetings is to
assess future developments. And, unlike with the weather, for example, the
current situation is not entirely clear, either. A broad set of data and diverse eco‐
nomic models are therefore helpful for us. Like a magnifying glass and a pair of
binoculars, they make it easier for us to examine our environment as closely as
possible. Following on from this, we can diﬀerentiate between two types of
uncertainty: data uncertainty and model uncertainty.
Data uncertainty arises because not all of the information is available to obtain a
picture of the “true” state of the economy. There are a number of reasons for
this: not all of the data that would be of interest are recorded statistically or can
be recorded in their entirety. Some data are only available with a considerable
time delay. Some are subject to measurement issues, so the data need to be
revised later. 
To give one example: for economic activity in the euro area,
Eurostat (European statistical oﬃce) provides a preliminary ﬂash estimate
around four weeks after the end of a quarter. This is based on a very limited
dataset, and especially the ﬁgures for the third month of the quarter need to be
estimated. The actual ﬂash estimate is released two weeks later. But even this
does not yet include any details or nominal data. Another two to three weeks
later, it is followed by an initial estimate with a more detailed breakdown by com‐
ponents. However, even then, changes should still be expected, and these can
sometimes be considerable. 
This demonstrates how we have only incomplete knowledge of the present in
real time. The description and assessment of the current situation are therefore
already subject to uncertainty. 
In addition to this, there is model uncertainty. In order to be able to examine
macroeconomic processes, complex realities must be simpliﬁed. This simpliﬁca‐
tion is achieved through models. They are conﬁned to a small number of interre‐
lationships that are as relevant as possible. All others are disregarded. In mone‐
tary policy, we use models, for example, to predict the development of inﬂation
or to estimate the eﬀects of our monetary policy measures. However, there is
plenty of room for discussion on whether the simpliﬁcations in each model are
always adequate. 

But even if we were all in agreement on the model framework, other sources of
uncertainty still remain. This concerns, for one thing, the parameters. These
reﬂect the assumed strength and dynamics of the relationships within a given
model. The parameters are usually estimated on the basis of past observations.
The estimation results therefore also depend on the selected investigation
period. Furthermore, parameters can evolve over time, for example as a result of
structural change. Particularly if this happens abruptly and the structural breaks
are not detected immediately, the model results can then be misleading. 
For another thing, models often make use of variables that cannot be observed
directly, such as potential output or natural interest rates. These must them‐
selves be estimated, which entails considerable uncertainty.  This also shows
how closely data uncertainty and model uncertainty are intertwined.
To summarise: models arrive at diﬀerent results due to uncertainties in their
structure, parameters and estimation variables, which may lead us to diﬀerent
conclusions. Assessment by experts then often determines the ﬁnal forecast
picture. 
In practice, data uncertainty and model uncertainty are especially relevant when
unexpected events occur. At these times, monetary policymakers’ need for com‐
prehensive information is, of course, particularly great. This is because the
appropriate monetary policy response depends on the nature of the unexpected
events in question. However, data uncertainty and model uncertainty make it dif‐
ﬁcult to deﬁnitively ascertain the exact nature and magnitude of a shock that is
currently taking place. There is a relatively high risk of being wrong. What can
monetary policymakers do against this?
First of all, we draw on many diﬀerent sources of information to obtain as com‐
plete a picture of the current situation as possible. For example, in 2019 and
2020, we at the Bundesbank began to regularly survey households and ﬁrms
about their assessments and expectations. Since 2020, we have been measuring
the activity of the German economy using a weekly index. Since the start of the
war in Ukraine, models have been developed that explicitly take gas price shocks
into account. 
[3]

In addition, we are continually working on improving our forecast models even
further. Artiﬁcial intelligence now oﬀers new possibilities, such as capturing non-
linear relationships, analysing large sets of data, and automating and accelerat‐
ing analytical processes. We are intensively examining all of these possibilities at
the Bundesbank. And we have already achieved some promising successes in
this regard. I will come back to touch upon one speciﬁc prototype later on.
Given the data uncertainty and model uncertainty, we in monetary policy are
well advised to pursue a strategy that is as robust as possible. To stick with the
image of Alan Greenspan: in the monetary policy landscape, you should best
avoid ﬂip-ﬂops. Sturdy footwear is needed here. A robust strategy produces
good results under various assumptions and prevents particularly costly
mistakes.
The more uncertain the setting, the greater the risk of policy errors. That is why,
when uncertainty is high, monetary policymakers are also in demand as risk
managers. We have to consider various scenarios, assess the likelihood that they
will materialise as well as their implications, and also weigh up the costs and
beneﬁts of diﬀerent monetary policy paths that lead to the inﬂation destination.
How do these considerations aﬀect our decisions? The short answer is: it
depends.
A gradual approach might make sense when uncertainty is high.  It is human
nature: when the room you are entering is dark, you do not simply rush in. You
proceed slowly, taking small steps. Applying this analogy to monetary policy, the
costs of reversing policy following an error could outweigh the costs of acting
too late. “Flip-ﬂopping” could itself add to the uncertainty and destabilise expec‐
tations. Moreover, abruptly changing direction can precipitate greater volatility in
ﬁnancial markets and pose risks to ﬁnancial stability. 
[4]

That said, it will not always be the case that cautious monetary policymaking is a
good response to high uncertainty. I am talking about situations in which a
“wait-and-see” attitude increases the risk that the outcome will be particularly
unfavourable. Going back to the dark room I mentioned just now: if the ﬂames
are right behind you, you should not edge your way forwards in small steps. A
scenario where inﬂation expectations risk drifting oﬀ might be just such a case.
Then, a vigorous response would be appropriate to protect yourself from this
worst-case scenario. As you can see, it may be necessary to respond swiftly and
comprehensively, precisely because uncertainty is high. 
Clearly, monetary policymakers acting as risk managers would be well advised to
take robust control approaches into account when making decisions in particu‐
larly uncertain times.
3 Drivers of uncertainty
3.1 Trade policy ﬂip-ﬂopping
Ladies and gentlemen,
Right now, these considerations are anything but mere theory. And that is due,
not least, to the White House. Since the change of administration in the United
States, no little uncertainty has been rippling across the Atlantic. The waves
caused by US (United States) trade policy have been particularly huge. 
Since April, the United States has been imposing additional tariﬀs of at least
10 % on all its trading partners. Tariﬀs that are higher still apply to imports of
steel and aluminium as well as to cars and automotive parts. Tit-for-tat tariﬀ
hikes by the United States and China drove tariﬀ rates to more than 100 % at
times. In mid-May, the two countries agreed to lower them signiﬁcantly for a
time.  Even so, the average eﬀective US (United States) tariﬀ rate has climbed
by more than 13 percentage points in the year to date, reaching its highest level
since the 1930s.  In addition, there is a risk of tariﬀs going higher still as of July
if bilateral negotiations fail. 
[5]
[6]
[7]

The shock waves unleashed by US (United States) trade policy are not only
having an impact via the actual tariﬀ burden. Their unpredictability and the
doubts they have raised about US (United States) economic and ﬁscal policy are
also leaving a mark, as reﬂected by the sometimes severe ﬂuctuations in ﬁnan‐
cial markets. The tariﬀ hikes announced on 2 April, for example, caused implied
stock market volatility to spike signiﬁcantly higher. This points to a high degree
of uncertainty among market participants – in the United States especially, but
also in the euro area.
Measured in terms of the number of mentions in newspaper articles, trade
policy uncertainty peaked this spring.  And that is hardly surprising given how
many questions this topic is raising: which tariﬀs will be put into eﬀect, tempo‐
rarily suspended or withdrawn – and when? What retaliatory measures will follow
in each case? To what degree will goods ﬂows in global trade be diverted? What
will be the fallout from this? Will action be taken to curb these diversions? And, if
so, by whom? You could keep going like this ad inﬁnitum. 
Even in times when trade policy moves in straight lines, forecasts of the eco‐
nomic impact of upheavals in the tariﬀ regime would be no more than rough
approximations. But we are dealing with an almost unpredictable cycle of
events: tariﬀs are threatened, put into force, partially withdrawn, and then
threatened again. 
One example of this is the US (United States) tariﬀ policy imposed on the
EU (European Union). First, on 12 March, the United States imposed general
tariﬀs of 25 % on steel and aluminium. A little time later, additional blanket tariﬀs
of 25 % were imposed on cars and automotive parts as well. On 2 April 2025,
President Trump also announced what he called “reciprocal” tariﬀs for a host of
trading partners depending on the bilateral trade deﬁcit and amounting to at
least 10 %, and, in the case of the EU (European Union), 20 %. But then, with
turmoil raging in ﬁnancial markets, President Trump, on 9 April, suspended the
tariﬀs for 90 days, initially in order to reach “deals”. The minimum 10 % tariﬀ and
the additional 25 % tariﬀ on cars, steel and aluminium were left in place, though.
On 23 May, President Trump threatened the EU (European Union) with 50 %
tariﬀs, starting on 1 June – a threat he withdrew two days later. This means that
forecasts are based on a footing that is less stable than usual.
[8]

As far as economic growth is concerned, at least the direction of travel seems to
be clear: Germany, like the euro area as a whole, is likely to suﬀer marked losses
as a result of US (United States) tariﬀ policy. First, the higher tariﬀs will make
European goods less competitive in the US (United States) market. This will prob‐
ably shrink exports to the United States. Second, sluggish economic activity in
the United States and other trading-partner countries will dampen demand for
products from Europe. Third, the high degree of uncertainty makes longer-term
planning more diﬃcult. Enterprises could therefore postpone investment deci‐
sions in the hope of quieter times.
The Bundesbank has simulated the impact of US (United States) tariﬀ policy
eﬀective in mid-April, China’s retaliatory measures, and the immediate exchange
rate response. The results suggest that economic output in the euro area could
be just under half a percentage point lower over the medium term. 
The direction in which the trade dispute will move inﬂation in the euro area,
however, remains unclear. On the one hand, weaker growth tends to dampen
prices. Potential diversion eﬀects resulting from more goods from China in the
European market might also leave inﬂation somewhat lower. On the other hand,
any retaliatory tariﬀs imposed by the EU (European Union) would fuel inﬂation. 
How the exchange rate will evolve going forward remains to be seen. In theory,
the expected response to the US (United States) tariﬀs would be a stronger
dollar. If anything, this would tend to drive prices higher in the euro area. But
things have played out diﬀerently so far. In the wake of the tariﬀ discussions,
trust in the US (United States) dollar has declined, at least temporarily, causing
the currency to depreciate markedly since 2 April. In the euro area, this has
dampened inﬂation.
Thinking beyond day-to-day terms, it is conceivable that longer-term eﬀects will
materialise as well. For example, tariﬀs can have a particularly negative impact
on trade in intermediate goods.  This is because they shake the calculations
upon which global production networks are based. 
[9]
[10]

Enterprises have ﬁne-tuned their supply chains to forge highly cost-eﬃcient pro‐
duction structures. However, the trade barriers are putting a spanner in the
works of global value chains. Enterprises will have no option but to recalculate
their supply chains and tweak some of their relationships with suppliers. They
will build up new partnerships and no doubt pay particular attention to strength‐
ening their resilience. This will not happen overnight, especially with political
conditions as unsettled as they are right now.  In the process, they may well
relinquish some of the eﬃciency gains they have reaped. Over the medium term,
this could generally drive up their costs and, as a result, their prices as well.
3.2 Structural change is progressing
The reconﬁguration of global value chains is working in tandem with other struc‐
tural changes: among them, ﬁrst and foremost, climate change and the transi‐
tion to a climate-neutral economy. The ageing of society is also playing a role,
with more people entering retirement and fewer people still in the workforce.
And let us not forget digitalisation, which brings with it great opportunities for
increased productivity but also considerable change in many professional ﬁelds,
as well as the risk of giving individual big players more market power.
All of these factors could inﬂuence the inﬂation environment. It is often unclear
in which direction inﬂation is heading, and it may change over time. Overall,
these structural drivers make it diﬃcult to assess medium-term inﬂation
developments.
3.3 New geopolitical realities
Alongside structural change and the almost fully unpredictable developments in
the tariﬀ dispute, there is a third factor of uncertainty. Old security policy certain‐
ties have given way to new geopolitical realities. This is creating new challenges
for Europe: we will thus need to invest signiﬁcantly more in our own security.
In order to suﬃciently bolster our defence capabilities, considerably greater
funds are required. There is a strong case against ﬁnancing such ad hoc needs in
the short term solely by rebalancing budgets. The European Commission, for
instance, proposes activating the national escape clause in the
EU (European Union) ﬁscal rules in order to temporarily allow countries greater
scope for borrowing.
[11]
[12]

I think this is a justiﬁable approach. It would allow countries to gradually adjust
to higher defence spending. However, it must be clear that this would only be a
transitional period. Increased deﬁcits cannot become a permanent state of
aﬀairs. A resilient Europe that is capable of action rests on a stable foundation.
This includes sound public ﬁnances whereby key items are funded in the core
budget and through current revenue.
Overall, there are signs of a more expansionary ﬁscal policy stance for the euro
area. Whether or not greater debt also leads to greater price pressures in the
euro area depends on many factors, such as what the additional money is spent
on, how quickly it ﬂows out, and how much money ﬂows in from abroad. These
uncertainties make it more diﬃcult to forecast developments. In any case, the
ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council is keeping a close eye on risk. As
stated in the account of our April meeting: “A boost in defence and infrastructure
spending could also lift inﬂation over the medium term.”
4 Monetary policy stance in the euro area
The current high level of uncertainty is a slight dampener on the gratiﬁcation
brought about by positive developments: since the beginning of the year, the
euro area inﬂation rate has fallen from 2.5 % to 2.2 % in April. This has ﬁnally
brought the target within reach. We are on the right path, even if it remains
rocky. The core rate has recently risen again. At 4 %, prices for services, in partic‐
ular, have seen surprisingly steep growth. 
The ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council will continue to steer the
monetary policy stance in such a way that the inﬂation rate stabilises at 2 % over
the medium-term. You may now be asking yourselves: “What exactly does that
mean for the next meeting in June? Will there be another interest rate
cut?” Pressing as these questions are, I unfortunately cannot answer them today.

Since July 2022, we on the ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council have
been following a data-dependent approach, making decisions on a meeting-by-
meeting basis. This approach has proved successful when dealing with the
heightened uncertainty of recent years, such as during the aftermath of the
COVID (coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic and in the wake of Russia’s war of
aggression against Ukraine. We have stayed ﬂexible and have continuously
assessed how the incoming data change the medium-term inﬂation outlook.
Here, we supplemented our baseline – which is the most likely outcome – with
scenario analyses. This also allowed us to assess the probability of less likely but
still conceivable outcomes. 
Using this approach, I believe that we are well equipped to deal with the current
high level of uncertainty, too. As I explained earlier, inﬂation could be higher or
lower than the latest expectations, depending on how the tariﬀ dispute develops
as well as other inﬂuencing factors like the exchange rate, services prices and
ﬁscal packages. In light of this, it seems to me more advisable than ever to make
decisions meeting by meeting on the basis of the latest data. If we had not
already been operating so ﬂexibly, we would have had to start doing so now, at
the latest. It would be impossible to reliably commit to a speciﬁc interest rate
path at the current juncture.
In June, the ECB (European Central Bank) Governing Council will have a fresh set
of data and an up-to-date forecast. These will help us to align the monetary
policy stance in a way that will bring us another step closer to our goal. Our des‐
tination is clear: we want the inﬂation rate to reach the target of 2 % soon and to
stabilise there on a sustainable basis. Of that, there is no doubt. In doing so, we
are thus providing a stable anchor for inﬂation expectations. 
Anchored inﬂation expectations make it easier for monetary policymakers to
bring inﬂation back to target after unexpected events. The successes in the ﬁght
against the far too high inﬂation rates of the past few years were achieved at rel‐
atively low economic cost.  This was partly attributable to the fact that inﬂation
expectations were better anchored than before. But we cannot rest on our
laurels with regard to the future, because the starting position has changed. We
no longer have decades of moderate inﬂation rates behind us. For many people,
the experience of such strong price surges was new and dramatic. The memory
of this is unlikely to fade quickly.
[13]
[14]

Inﬂation expectations, as well the associated price and wage setting, may now
respond more quickly or more strongly to future inﬂation shocks. We therefore
need to be particularly vigilant when it comes to the evolution of inﬂation expec‐
tations. For instance, medium-term inﬂation expectations amongst euro area
households and ﬁrms were recently on the rise again. Concerns about rising
prices caused by tariﬀ policy are not only on American minds, then. We will keep
a close eye on this development.
Ensuring that inﬂation expectations are ﬁrmly anchored is a permanent task for
monetary policymakers. This can be achieved by ensuring that our commitment
to stability is highly credible and that our communication is clear.
To further improve clarity, we have since implemented AI (artiﬁcial intelligence)-
assisted text analysis methods, too. In this vein, the Bundesbank has developed
a novel AI (artiﬁcial intelligence) model that can produce detailed and transpar‐
ent evaluations of monetary policy texts.  This allows us to assess, for example,
whether certain statements are likely to send the desired signals. After all, we do
not want our communication to trigger undesirable market reactions or create
additional uncertainty. AI (artiﬁcial intelligence) analysis does not replace human
expertise. But it can help us to further improve our understanding of monetary
policy communication and its impact.
5 Conclusion
Ladies and gentlemen, 
If you are currently wondering whether this speech was generated by
AI (artiﬁcial intelligence), or, indeed, if it will ever end, I can assure you that real
people were involved in the speech-writing process, and I have now come to my
closing remarks. Our AI (artiﬁcial intelligence) model is currently used to evalu‐
ate texts. Incidentally, this speech was classiﬁed as “neutral” in monetary policy
terms.
[15]

Alan Greenspan would probably have pushed the model to its limits. His state‐
ments were often so cryptic that the media and ﬁnancial markets took to
seeking out other clues: for example, when it came to monetary policy decisions,
they looked at the thickness of his briefcase. A slim briefcase was thought to
indicate an uneventful meeting without interest rate changes, whilst a bulging
briefcase signalled a need for discussion and an adjustment to the policy rate.
During his term in oﬃce, Mr Greenspan was once asked whether there was any
truth to this theory. His answer: “The thickness of my briefcase depended on
whether or not I had packed a sandwich.”
Unfortunately, not all uncertainties can be so easily erased from the monetary
policy landscape. But, as we can see, asking direct questions and talking to each
other often contributes to greater clarity. Which makes me all the more excited
for our discussion!
Thank you very much.
