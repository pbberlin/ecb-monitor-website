1 Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen,
Good morning and welcome to the Conference on Markets and Intermediaries, an 
event jointly organised by the Bundesbank and the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.
In my opening speech, I will take you on a helicopter tour of the programme and share 
some thoughts on the topics that will be covered over the next two days. The 
programme certainly does cover a wide range of topics. It addresses current challenges 
facing financial markets, financial intermediaries, and central banks.
Since the Great Financial Crisis, central banks worldwide have expanded their balance 
sheets, injected additional liquidity into the financial system, and broadened their 
collateral frameworks. In addition, financial regulation has been adapted to make the 
financial system more stable.
While these measures served useful purposes, they also had side effects, not least in 
money and capital markets. Policymakers and regulators are therefore well-advised to 
evaluate the effects of their measures.
2 Non-bank financial institutions
The first session is dedicated to non-bank financial institutions, or NBFIs.
This sector includes, amongst others, insurers, investment funds, and money market 
and hedge funds. It is strongly interconnected, both with other sectors and across 
countries. Its share of the global financial system, as measured by total financial assets, 
is almost one-half.
Clearly, it could be a source of systemic risks. But the risks presented byNBFIs often    
lie out of view. This makes them more difficult to monitor and assess. All the more 
important, then, to close data gaps and strengthen the resilience of the sector.
One particular source of vulnerability are fire sales of open-ended funds. These are the 
subject of a paper that Rüdiger Weber is presenting this morning.1

2/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Open-ended funds are especially prone to fire sales because, during episodes of 
market stress, they often face significant pressure from investors who want to liquidate 
their holdings quickly. Fund managers may then be forced to offload fund assets at 
short notice. And if those assets are less liquid, they may have to sell them at lower 
prices. This may amplify price declines and liquidity shortages.
Effective liquidity management and regulation are very important here. A recently 
published Bundesbank paper shows that price-based liquidity management tools help 
keep the financial fragility of open-ended mutual funds in check.2
In times of stress, investors also try to protect their capital by shifting it into safer assets. 
However, this flight to safety can intensify the downward pressure on the prices of 
riskier assets as demand for the latter declines.
The Financial Stability Board is doing important work in this field. But it is currently 
focused on microprudential regulation. I think theFSB's work on this front needs to be  
complemented by the development of macroprudential regulation for theNBFI sector.   
In any case, we should not jeopardise what we have achieved in the banking regulation 
space by allowing stability risks to build up elsewhere in the financial system.
3 Central bank digital currencies
The second session is on central bank digital currencies (CBDC).
CBDC is an issue that is keeping almost all central banks very busy at the moment. The  
Eurosystem is hard at work preparing for the potential introduction of a digital euro.
As the world turns increasingly digital, the digital euro would provide a secure and 
efficient digital payment option that complements cash. It aims to strengthen Europe's 
strategic autonomy by building on European infrastructures, and to promote innovation 
in the private sector.
However, introducing aCBDC could also have unintended side effects. If bank    
customers were allowed to hold it in large amounts, periods of banking distress could 
trigger large, sudden shifts out of deposits intoThis could lead to financial  CBDC.  
instability.
And ifCBDC were too attractive a substitute for deposits, commercial banks' access to    
retail deposits could erode over time. Which could lead to structural disintermediation 
and call into question our proven two-tier banking system. It is therefore of the essence 
to designCBDC in a way that prevents these risks from materialising.   
The challenge is to optimise the usability ofCBDC as a means of payment while at the    
same time limiting its effects on the market for bank deposits. Two decisive factors in 
this regard are remuneration and holding limits. Let me say a few words on each of 
these.

3/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Remuneration means the rate of interest on people's holdings ofIf that rate of  CBDC.  
interest were positive, holdingCBDC would be more attractive. But at the same time,    
that would lead to outflows out of bank deposits.
Based on a welfare-maximising model setting, Pascal Paul will argue later this 
afternoon that central banks should allow for a positive interest rate.This stands in 3 
contrast to the intention of the Governing Council not to remunerate digital euro 
holdings.4
Why are we not in favour of remuneration?
Because our aim is to make the digital euro a digital complement to cash, and there is 
no remuneration for holding cash. We neither want to compete with commercial banks 
for deposits, nor do we want to employ the digital euro as a monetary policy instrument.
The second, perhaps even more important, factor is holding limits. We intend to limit 
digital euro holdings to a certain amount, because we want to ensure the digital euro 
does not lead to large sudden shifts or disintermediation.
The limits currently under discussion range from €500 to €3,000.A recent Bundesbank 5 
paper finds that an optimal holding limit would be in a range between €1,500 and 
€2,500. On the Governing Council, we have not yet taken a decision on the exact 6 
amount. What is more,EU legislators might be involved here.   
But as regards the practical usability of the digital euro, the exact limit does not play a 
major role anyway. This is because a reverse waterfall system, as it is called, would 
allow users to link their digital euro wallet to their bank account. They can then convert 
their bank deposits into digital euro automatically and instantly if their holdings are 
insufficient to make a payment.
4 Banking and deposit flows
Allowing users to convert an unlimited amount of deposits intoCBDC would expose    
commercial banks to substantial run risk. In any case, zero or lower interest rates will 
not discourage them from doing that in times of crisis. However, digital bank runs can 
happen even without CBDC.
The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and other regional banks in March 2023 showed how 
quickly customers can withdraw their deposits these days. At Silicon Valley Bank alone, 
customers pulled outUSD 42 billion within the space of a single day, which equated to    
around one-quarter of total deposits. And anotherUSD 100 billion would have been    
withdrawn a day later.The depositors on the run were apparently account holders with 7 
uninsured deposits.
Banking and deposit flows are the subject of Session 3. Dominic Cucic will present a 
paper showing that bank customers do indeed redistribute their deposits when deposit 
insurance limits change.Credible and reliable deposit insurance helps to prevent bank 8 
runs and preserve financial stability.

4/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
In the euro area, we currently have deposit insurance at the national level. Adding a 
European layer in the form of a hybrid model would help prevent situations where large 
shocks overwhelm national deposit insurance systems and lead to cross-border 
contagion.
As a European layer should be risk-based, large exposures of banks to individual 
sovereigns are an issue. Currently, many banks hold a disproportionately large number 
of bonds issued by their domestic governments. If this were to continue, a common 
deposit insurance arrangement could lead to a redistribution of sovereign solvency risks.
In my view, the newEU legislative session provides a good opportunity to move forward    
on both issues: with a reduction in banks' exposures to individual sovereigns, and a 
common European deposit insurance system.
5 Central bank interventions and market behaviour
Session 4 of this conference focuses on the impact of central bank interventions on 
market behaviour. Both papers in this session underline that such central bank 
measures need to be carefully designed.9
Central banks have taken a wide range of non-standard monetary policy measures to 
ensure sufficient monetary stimulus at the effective lower bound. But in the medium to 
long term, such policies may lead to inefficiencies. These could arise in financial 
markets themselves or in the allocation of resources affected by the boost to lending.
This makes it all the more important to evaluate the instruments used and the lessons 
learned. It is therefore very fitting that we are currently carrying out a strategy review in 
the Eurosystem. Amongst other things, this will provide an opportunity to critically 
review the quantitative easing policies we have seen in the past.
The extensive bond purchases contributed to price stability in an era of low inflation, but 
they were also associated with numerous side effects in financial markets. Without 
prejudging the outcome of the review, I think their use should be limited to exceptional 
circumstances.
6 Conclusion
Ladies and gentlemen,
The conference concludes with a panel discussion on theECB's new operational  
framework. As I have already expressed my views on this on a different occasion,I 10 
will end my speech by expressing my gratitude.
Thanks to the organisers from the Bundesbank and Humboldt University for setting up 
this conference. Thanks to the presenters, discussants and panellists for sharing their 
insights. Thanks to all participants for their contributions. And special thanks to Annette 
Vissing-Jørgensen from the Federal Reserve Board, who will give a keynote on 
"Balance sheet policy above the effective lower bound".11
