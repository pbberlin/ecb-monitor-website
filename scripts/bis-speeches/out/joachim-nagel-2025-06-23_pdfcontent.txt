1 Germany could be a success story
Ladies and gentlemen, 
This is now the fourth time that I have had the honour and pleasure of speaking at the 
Frankfurt Euro Finance Summit. Thank you very much for your invitation. The name of 
this event is  . Now, I am not known as much Agenda 2030–an equity story for Germany
of a storyteller in my role as Bundesbank President. And attracting investors is not part 
of my job description, either. But I would like to reiterate here what I have been saying 
for some time: Germany could be a success story if it can decisively tackle and resolve 
its structural economic issues.
After being dubbed the   for a while, great hopes are now being sick man of Europe
placed in Germany's new Federal Government, both here and throughout Europe. This 
could actually become a real turnaround story. In a speech held in Berlin at the 
beginning of March, I outlined twelve key economic policy measures to boost growth in 
Germany. I will touch upon these briefly again at the end. Today, however, I will be 1 
focusing on the topics of economic activity, price developments, and monetary policy.
2 Between the tariff shock and shaping the future
First, let us take a look at the economic situation and growth outlook in Germany. The 
German economy grew by 0.4% in the first quarter of this year, after contracting slightly 
at the end of last year. The expansion in the first quarter was surprisingly significant. It 
was due, in part, to anticipatory effects related to tariffs, while the underlying cyclical 
trend remains weak at present.
In the second quarter, economic activity is likely to more or less stagnate. Export 
business is undoubtedly suffering fromUS tariff policy. In addition, industry is seeing    
comparatively low capacity utilisation. Accordingly, firms have relatively little incentive to 
invest. Furthermore, household consumption is currently subdued. This is because the 
labour market is trending downward and wages are no longer rising as sharply.
According to our new Forecast for Germany, the economy will tread water on average 
this year.However, the forecast was not able to take account of the fact that the 2 
revised rate of growth for the first quarter is now twice as high as originally reported. A 
slight increase in aggregate output therefore appears to be well within the realms of 
possibility on annual average.

In any case, this would then mark three years in a row with essentially no economic 
growth. However, there are now more and more signs that this long period of drought is 
coming to an end. The Bundesbank's economists consider it likely that German gross 
domestic product will see a noticeable rise of 0.7% in calendar-adjusted terms next 
year. For 2027, they are projecting a growth rate of 1.2%.
This means that, after this long drought, we have not quite reached a lush green oasis 
just yet. Instead, Germany's path forward remains challenging–between the tariff shock 
and shaping the future. On the one hand,US trade policy and geopolitical uncertainty    
are burdens. On the other hand, the fiscal package is bolstering economic activity.
On their own, the tariff hikes factored into the baseline scenario of the forecast and the 
heightened level of uncertainty could cost Germany around ¾ percentage point of 
economic growth over the medium term. There are three key factors here. First, tariffs 
are making German products less competitive in the keyUS sales market. Second,    
export business is suffering from the overall weakening of global economic growth 
caused by tariffs. Third, elevated uncertainty is dampening economic growth. The lack 
of planning certainty is paralysing firms' investment, in particular.
Alongside tariffs and greater uncertainty, the changes in exchange rates, financial 
market responses and commodity prices triggered byUS economic policy are also    
having an impact on economic growth. But I would like to point out the following: the 
estimated growth losses for Germany of ¾ percentage point over the medium term 
represent just a snapshot of trade policy. It appears possible that the tariff dispute could 
either escalate or de-escalate at any time.
As I mentioned before, the growth-damaging effects of tariffs are offset by the positive 
growth stimulus from fiscal policy. Extensive scope for additional debt has been created 
for increased expenditure on infrastructure and defence. However, the exact shape that 
the new fiscal stance will ultimately take is still unclear. In the new Forecast for 
Germany, our experts estimate that the additional expenditure on defence and 
infrastructure alone could increase economic growth by a total of ¾ percentage point in 
2026 and 2027. 
Nevertheless, Germany's growth remains below the euro area average. According to 
the June Eurosystem staff projections, euro area economic output will rise by 0.9% this 
year. Next year and the year after, the pace of growth is expected pick up slightly to 3 
1.1% and 1.3%, respectively.
I recently gave an entire speech on the topic of monetary policy in times of high 
. At this point, I would like to emphasise one thing in particular: the uncertainty4 
economic outlook is extremely uncertain at present. But it already seems as if 
exceptional uncertainty is almost becoming the new norm.
It is still very difficult to assess how the situation in the Middle East will develop 
following Israel's attack on Iran. We can all only hope that the conflicts in the Middle 
East will be resolved as quickly as possible. Every single person who has to suffer from 
war is one too many. The economic repercussions of the conflict in the Middle East are 
also impossible to predict at present. In the event of a prolonged and severe conflict, oil

prices could rise considerably, for instance. The economic outlook could then change 
markedly compared to what I am talking about today–in terms of both economic activity 
and prices.
3 2% target achieved
Alongside oil and gas prices, tariff policy and fiscal policy play important roles in future 
price developments. However, their currently expected impact on inflation is unclear.
For example, lower economic growth due to the tariff dispute could further reduce 
inflationary pressures. Conversely, tariff-related fragmentation of supply chains could 
result in higher costs, which would then lead to rising prices.
German fiscal policy will likely dampen inflation markedly in the short term if relief 
measures, such as the reduction in electricity tax and grid fees, come into effect. By 
contrast, greater expenditure on defence and infrastructure could drive aggregate 
demand and, indirectly, consumer prices over the medium term.
It is clear that the broad-based decline in commodity prices is already putting the brakes 
on inflation. And it is also clear that a stronger euro will reduce price inflation in both 
Germany and the euro area as a whole. The recent exchange rate movements were 
atypical for periods of heightened uncertainty in the financial markets. Unusually, theUS 
dollar did not benefit from its status as a safe haven, but depreciated instead.  
Immediately after the announcements ofUS tariffs at the beginning of April, there was a    
slump in risk appetite amongst investors, leading to significant losses in the stock 
market amid high financial market volatility. The prices ofUS Treasuries also fell    
markedly. 
In the new Eurosystem staff projections, exchange rate developments are another 
reason why the inflation forecast was revised downwards over the shorter term. For this 
year, the economists now expect euro area inflation of 2%. Next year, it is expected to 
temporarily fall markedly to 1.6%, before rising to 2% again in 2027.
In contrast to the projections that theECB released in March, we are pleased to say    
that we are now likely to achieve the 2% target this year. According to initial estimates, 
euro area inflation declined to 1.9% in May. We are expecting comparable figures for 
the coming months. I am therefore confident that inflation will stabilise at 2% on a 
sustainable basis and that we will thus achieve our medium-term inflation target. 
This holds true even if the inflation rate may temporarily dip below 2% next year, driven 
mainly by lower energy prices. It is unlikely that inflation will remain persistently below 
target. Underlying inflation and, above all, services inflation are too high for this to 
happen. According to initial estimates, services inflation declined significantly in May, 
but still stands at 3.2%.
4 No reason for monetary policy to let up
At the most recent meeting of theECB Governing Council, we lowered the keyECB       
interest rates for the eighth time by 25 basis points. Due to the improved price outlook, I 
believe that this decision was appropriate. The key interest rate now stands at 2%. It is 

4/5 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
thus exactly in the middle of the range for the natural rate of interest calculated by 
Eurosystem experts.Despite all of the conceptual difficulties and uncertainty 5 
surrounding the natural rate of interest:monetary policy is certainly no longer having a 6 
restrictive effect with the current key interest rates. In my view, this level of interest 
rates provides us with a very good starting position from which to respond to a wide 
variety of developments. 
Current price data and inflation forecasts are signalling  . We on mission accomplished
theECB Governing Council can certainly be satisfied with this. However, we cannot    
simply sit back and take it easy. Instead, it is vital that we keep our eyes and ears open 
for any risks to price stability. This also holds true given the current developments in the 
Middle East.
In light of the present uncertainty, cautious monetary policy and communication remain 
appropriate. The degree of uncertainty is already far too high. TheECB Governing    
Council should not add to this itself. As critical factors can change quickly in the current 
environment, we would be well advised to stay flexible. In other words, it is not sensible 
to make pre-commitments–neither for cutting interest rates again nor for keeping 
monetary policy unchanged. We should continue to make data-dependent decisions on 
a meeting-by-meeting basis and not rush into anything.
5 Spending alone is not enough
Allow me to conclude by summarising the most important points: for the German 
economy, there are signs that the long period of drought is coming to an end. However, 
the path ahead will not lead us straight to a green oasis, but will remain 
challenging–between growth-damaging tariff effects and growth-enhancing fiscal policy. 
Even if euro area inflation is back around 2% and will likely remain there in the medium 
term again after a dip, too, monetary policymakers have no reason to let up. Given the 
very high degree of uncertainty, theECB Governing Council needs to be especially    
responsive and cautious.
Furthermore, with regard to economic policy, I would like to convey the following 
message: spending alone is by no means enough. Persistently higher growth in 
Germany can only be achieved if structural adjustments are made at the same time. To 
name just the key points: expanding the supply of labour, advancing the energy 
transition, creating better investment conditions for enterprises. This also includes 
strengthening incentives to work, accelerating planning and approval processes, and 
reducing excessive bureaucracy.
Then, additional government spending can bring growth to a consistently higher path if 
the extra funds are used effectively and efficiently for infrastructure, research, 
innovation, digitalisation, and defence. This could turn into a success story for Germany.
