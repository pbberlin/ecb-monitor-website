1 Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen, it is as always a pleasure to be at the European Banking
Congress and speak to such a distinguished audience. This year’s theme –
 investing in Europe – is especially timely given the major challenges our contin‐
ent is currently facing.
First, Europe’s security is under increasing pressure. In response, Europe needs
to spend much more on defence. 
Second, the global trade environment has become much more challenging. As a
result, external trade will no longer drive European growth as strongly as it did in
previous decades.

5 Conclusion

Third, Europe is about to undergo a major demographic shift, as the baby
boomer generation retires. This means that labour supply will be scarce for the
foreseeable future. 
Finally, Europe is transitioning to a carbon-neutral economy. This transition will
require major investment. 
Taken together, both labour and capital for productive investment will be in
increasingly short supply. With limited resources, our only way forward is to
become more productive. In my speech, I would like to take a long-term per‐
spective on Europe’s productivity and – since productivity is a mean to an end
and not an end itself – on its standard of living.
I will structure my remarks around two key questions: First, how have productiv‐
ity and the standard of living in Europe developed compared to the United States
over the past thirty years? And second, what can Europe do to boost
productivity?
2 Productivity growth: lagging behind
Let us begin by examining how productivity has evolved in Europe and the
United States over the past thirty years. As my measure of productivity, I will use
the ratio of real GDP (gross domestic product) to hours worked. I have chosen
1995 as the starting point for my comparison. Why 1995, you might ask?
The reason is simple: In the decades after World War II, productivity growth in
Europe consistently outpaced that in the United States. However, this process of
catching up ended in the mid-1990s.
Between 1995 and 2024, labour productivity in the United States increased by
almost 61 per cent. By contrast, in the European Union it only rose by a little
more than 39 per cent.  As a result, a productivity gap of around 21 percentage
points opened up over these 30 years. 
When we look at such a long period, it might seem as if the gap just kept widen‐
ing steadily, year after year. But a closer look reveals that is not what actually
happened.

Between 1995 and 2002, productivity growth was relatively lively in both eco‐
nomies, with the United States only slightly ahead. But starting in 2003, a gap
began to open, with the United States pulling ahead of Europe. One important
factor was that US (United States) ﬁrms beneﬁted much more from the eﬃciency
gains in information and communication technologies
(ICT (information and communications technology)).
The gap widened sharply in 2009, following the global ﬁnancial crisis:
US (United States) productivity surged, while European productivity declined.
This jump in US (United States) productivity has been linked to “excess layoﬀs” –
 meaning ﬁrms cut hours and jobs even more than output fell.
From 2011 onwards, the productivity gap actually began to narrow again, as
US (United States) growth slowed markedly. One reason for slower
US (United States) productivity growth may have been a post-recession “rehiring
eﬀect”: As ﬁrms brought back workers, the earlier productivity gains from excess
layoﬀs gradually faded.
All in all, by 2019, US (United States) productivity was less than 12 percentage
points higher than in Europe, compared to 1995.  So, where did the current
productivity gap of 21 per cent which I mentioned before come from? 
Enter the COVID (coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic and Russia’s attack on
Ukraine. In just ﬁve years, the productivity gap widened by almost 10 percentage
points.
Let that sink in for a moment. Almost half of the productivity gap that has
opened up over the past thirty years stems from just the last ﬁve years.
Four main factors seem to have driven this recent divergence.
First, by 2019, the United States had likely returned to a structurally higher path
of productivity growth. By contrast, structural impediments continued to weigh
on European productivity.
Second, the ﬁrst year of the COVID (coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic brought
with it another productivity boost in the United States, similar to what we saw
during the global ﬁnancial crisis.

Third, Russia’s attack on Ukraine caused an adverse terms-of-trade shock for
energy-dependent Europe.
Fourth, US (United States) ﬁscal policy was much more expansionary than in
Europe, giving a bigger boost to real GDP (gross domestic product) growth.  To
give you a sense of scale: Between 2020 and 2024, the average
US (United States) ﬁscal deﬁcit was 8.3 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product)
 – more than three times that of Europe.
To sum up: While the European productivity gap has been growing for some
time, it has widened signiﬁcantly only in recent years. It is the outcome of a
complex mix of persistent trends and recent shocks. 
3 Standard of living: better than expected
Ultimately, productivity is just a means to an end – a higher standard of living. So,
how has the standard of living in Europe relative to the United States evolved
over the last thirty years? Given the modest productivity growth, one might
expect Europe to have fallen noticeably behind.
Of course, I am well aware that individual well-being depends on more than just
GDP (gross domestic product). Think of social security, health or equality. But
even when looking at output alone, the reality is more nuanced.
If we look at growth in real GDP (gross domestic product) per capita instead of
per hour worked, the gap between the United States and Europe is less than half
the productivity gap. From 1995 to 2024, real GDP (gross domestic product) per
capita increased by 58 per cent in the United States and by 50 per cent in
Europe. This corresponds to annual growth rates of 1.6 per cent for the United
States and 1.4 per cent for Europe.  Until 2019, real
GDP (gross domestic product) per capita grew by 45 per cent in the
US (United States) and 44 per cent in Europe, remaining nearly on par.
The reason for the divergence between productivity growth and per capita
growth is quite simple: Europe successfully managed to activate previously
untapped labour reserves. Accordingly, the lower growth in labour productivity
was partly compensated for by an increase in labour input. 
[9]
[10]
[11]

So far, I have focused on real GDP (gross domestic product) ﬁgures from national
accounts. They show how much economies have grown, adjusted for changes in
the respective price levels over time. But to compare the standard of living
between the United States and Europe, we need to account for how price levels
diﬀer between regions. 
A well-established method for adjusting GDP (gross domestic product) ﬁgures
for price level diﬀerences across countries is the use of purchasing power parit‐
ies. However, this approach comes with its own statistical challenges. 
For example, purchasing power parity calculations have to rely on a common
basket of goods and services. However, this common basket may not be fully
representative for all of the countries under consideration. In addition, prices are
collected less frequently than in national accounts. As a result, they have to be
interpolated or extrapolated. Therefore, I will refrain from presenting exact
numbers here, as diﬀerent calculation methods yield diﬀerent results. 
But one thing we can say with great conﬁdence: When price level diﬀerences
and their changes are taken into account, Europe’s standard of living relative to
the United States has developed less badly than suggested by the unadjusted
ﬁgures.
Still, this is no reason to be complacent. If Europe wants to raise the standard of
living for future generations, we need to boost productivity growth.
4 Policy measures: room for improvement
How can we make this happen? Some of the reasons for Europe’s productivity
gap can only be addressed over the long term. For example, our ﬁscal policy
constraints due to high levels of public debt, or the lack of access to cheap
energy.
Moreover, Europe is unlikely to fully catch up with the digital transformation of
the 2000s. One priority should be to ensure that we reap the beneﬁts of the next
IT (information technology) revolution, driven by artiﬁcial intelligence.
Furthermore, we can act immediately where it matters most: at the level of our
ﬁrms, where innovation and growth actually happen. 

When we compare the business landscape in the United States and Europe,
some striking diﬀerences stand out.  In the US (United States), the business
ecosystem thrives on a dynamic duality: On the one hand, there are many small,
innovative start-ups that disrupt entire industries. On the other hand, there are
large, productive corporations that dominate global markets and beneﬁt from
economies of scale.
In Europe, the picture looks diﬀerent. Here, our economies are usually domin‐
ated by small and medium-sized companies. On the one hand, quite a number
of those ﬁrms are what we call hidden champions, which are market leaders for
a speciﬁc product. But on the other hand, many ﬁrms are neither small enough
to be truly agile and highly innovative, nor large enough to fully beneﬁt from
economies of scale. 
So, how can we encourage the emergence of innovative start-ups – and help pro‐
ductive incumbent ﬁrms continue to grow? Given the European focus of my
speech, I will concentrate on what can be done at the level of the European
Union. However, these measures need to be complemented by targeted reforms
in the Member States.
4.1 Simplify and harmonise regulation
One important step to boost productivity growth is to make it easier to do busi‐
ness in Europe. This means simplifying and harmonising European regulation.
Right now, entrepreneurs and companies face a patchwork of rules and proced‐
ures that vary from country to country. To tackle this, the EU (European Union)
has launched a major simpliﬁcation initiative, including the OMNIBUS packages.
These packages aim to cut unnecessary bureaucracy, streamline procedures,
and remove outdated or overlapping rules. By making rules clearer and more
consistent, they could reduce compliance costs.
[12]

One promising solution to harmonise regulation is the “28th Regime” – an
optional EU (European Union)-wide legal framework that companies can choose,
instead of navigating 27 diﬀerent national systems. This would make cross-
border operations easier, cut compliance costs even more, and help businesses
scale up faster. In eﬀect, it would remove some of the remaining barriers across
our internal market, which encompasses 450 million customers. And by helping
small and medium-sized companies to expand across borders, we could turn
hidden champions into global leaders.
4.2 Improve access to equity market ﬁnancing
But even the best ideas need the right kind of ﬁnancing in order to grow. Europe
still lags behind when it comes to market-based equity ﬁnancing. This is why it is
essential that we swiftly complete the Savings and Investments Union.
For start-ups, better access to venture capital is crucial. For one thing, Europe
needs to build the necessary infrastructure to deepen and integrate its venture
capital markets. For another, we need to encourage institutional investors to put
more money into venture capital.
But also for medium-sized and large companies, we need deeper and more
integrated capital markets. Right now, Europe’s capital markets are still fragmen‐
ted and underdeveloped compared to those in the US (United States). This lack
of integration means less depth and liquidity, making it harder for companies to
raise the funds they need to grow. 
Taken together, important European initiatives are already in motion. To realise
their full potential, we must implement these European initiatives with speed
and ambition – and reinforce them with targeted national policies.
5 Conclusion
Ladies and gentlemen, let me summarise and conclude. I began by highlighting
Europe’s signiﬁcant productivity gap with the United States that opened up over
the past three decades.
A closer look suggests that Europe’s standard of living compared to the
US (United States) has developed less badly than productivity ﬁgures alone
would suggest. This indicates that Europe’s starting position may not be as dire
as it is often portrayed to be.

Nevertheless, Europe could and should do better. The policy measures discussed
before could help Europe to boost productivity growth and restart its conver‐
gence process. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe faces major challenges. 
Let’s turn them into something productive. 
Thank you very much for your attention.
