Presentation accompanying the speech
Let me begin by thanking for inviting me to give this lecture today.  Tampere University 
It is truly a great pleasure and an honour, as your university conducts first-class 
, including economics. The Finnish Centre of research in the social sciences
Excellence in Tax Systems Research is a well-known case in point. I can personally 
testify to the quality of the education here because my dear wife holds a Master of 
from the University of Tampere.Social Sciences degree 
Besides, I myself took 'Introduction to Economics', here, during one  Economics 101, 
hot summer, after completing my military service. That was before heading to the 
United States to study on an ASLA/ economics and international relations  Fulbright

Anyway, it really is wonderful to be back.
My lecture today is about money and the monetary system, and how these have

some extent Europe too, as case studies.
This is more than economics proper, reflecting my own background  economic history

Slide 2. Overview of presentation
I will start by discussing money and the definition of money. Then I will move on to 
different currency arrangements in Finland through history, with a special focus on the 
20 century and the Finnish markka, our long-standing national currency.th 
After that, we'll look at the euro and how it was introduced. How has life been for 
Finland as a member of the EMU?
Let's then consider the new challenges ahead for the international monetary system, 
related to geopolitics and technological change. And finally, some conclusions.
Slide 3. What is money and how has it changed over two centuries?

2/13 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Let's kick off with this question: What is money, and how has it changed over two 
centuries?
Money is a simple tool for a complex task. It does three jobs.
First, it is a . We use it to make payments. It spares us the  medium of exchange
trouble of barter. If I'm selling timber and want bread, I do not have to find a baker who 
needs timber. Money stands in the middle and makes trade possible. Related to that, 
money is also the legal means of payment of debts. 
Second, it is a . It enables pricing of goods and services. It is used in  unit of account
contracts as a standard of debts and other obligations. Profits and losses are measured 
in it. When the unit of account is under pressure, the economy may falter. When the unit 
is steady, people can make plans for the future.
Third, it is a . It preserves purchasing power over time. The store should  store of value
not be taken for granted though. Inflation may eat away at it. Panics and scares can 
undermine it. But the point is simple: money ought to hold its worth well enough that 
people can save, investment can grow, and everyone can sleep soundly at night.
These three functions of money stand on one foundation:. Trust that the coin is  trust
true. Trust that the banknote will be honoured. Trust that the deposit can be redeemed.
Trust does not appear by magic. It is earned and guarded by institutions and through 
rules and regulations - mints, central banks, courts, laws, regulated practices and 
procedures. This we can call . And when we link the various  a monetary system
national or supranational monetary systems together, we get the international 
.monetary system
Over the past two centuries the form of money has changed, but its functions have 
. We moved from metal coins to paper banknotes, used as fiat currency (which is not
legal tender and inconvertible to metal), and from banknotes to bank deposits, then to 
credit and debit cards, and from cards to electronic and instant payments.
As for the monetary system, over time we have seen hard pegs to gold and silver, we 
have seen fixed exchange rates, let currencies float, and we have built currency unions 
between countries.
And today, we see the terms tokenised deposits, stablecoins and central bank digital 
currencies.
Through all of this, one lesson is clear: the form can change, but the function 
. If trust is strong, the system works. If trust fails, nothing else will help. Let me remains
next elaborate on this by focusing on Case Finland.
Slide 4. Finnish currency arrangements: 1811, 1860, 1865, 1878

3/13 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Finland's monetary story begins, in modern form, in, when Tsar Alexander I of  1811
Russia established the central banking office that later became the Bank of Finland. 
This makes us the fourth oldest still existing central bank in the world.
Furthermore, we can also say that we have a claim for the world's oldest central bank, 
the Riksbank, because when that institution started its operations in, Finland was  1668
still an integral part of Sweden!
The creation of a central bank for Finland was discussed at , which  the Diet of Porvoo
was a gathering of the four estates of Finland convened in 1809 after Sweden lost 
Finland to Russia. Meeting in the town of Porvoo, the four estates swore an oath of 
allegiance to the Tsar, who in turn confirmed Finland's old laws, religion and privileges 
– including private property.
The Porvoo Diet proposed the setting up of a central bank under the supervision of the 
Diet, but this was not acceptable to the Tsar. The central bank was instead 
subordinated to the economic department of the newly created Grand Duchy of Finland 
– first in Turku, from 1811, and then from 1819 onwards in Helsinki.
The political purpose was clear. Following its crushing defeat in the War of Finland in 
18081809, Sweden had ceded Finland to Russia in the Peace Treaty of Hamina in 
1809. St Petersburg wanted a measure of monetary order in the new Grand Duchy  and 
to replace the Swedish currency in circulation with Russian roubles.
However, in the first decades after 1809, both Swedishand Russian paper  riksdalers 
roubles circulated in Finland. Eventually, thedominated, but it was no model of  rouble 
stability. In particular, it was badly shaken by the Crimean War of 18531856. In Finland, 
the need for a domestic anchor became plain. So, in, Finland introduced the 1860  
as a national unit.markka  
At first the markka was defined as ¼ of the paper rouble. The key break came in,  1865
when the markka was and thus freed from the instability of the rouble.  pegged to silver 
It was a polite way of saying: "Thank you, but we'll do this." our way
There was a parallel plan in St. Petersburg to stabilize the rouble too, but that plan was 
derailed by the uprising in Poland and the ensuing costly war. Finland was unaffected, 
however, and so managed to establish a national monetary system of its own.
The pegging of the currency to a precious metal was not a passing fancy. It was a 
major signal: Finland wanted credibility, access to European capital, and a place in 
European trade. It was a means of integration: silver was the dominant monetary 
standard in Northern Europe at the time.
The late 19th century was a time of economic liberalism and rapid growth in Finland. 
The Finnish , enacted in (effective in 1880), abolished  Law on Freedom of Trade  1879 
the old guild restrictions and granted citizens the general right to engage in business. 
Though the priest and liberal policy entrepreneur had died decades  Anders Chydenius 
earlier, his deeply  18th-century advocacy of economic liberty and free enterprise 
influenced the intellectual climate that made such reform possible. The law thus 

4/13 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
realized, in practice, the Enlightenment ideals of economic freedom that Chydenius had 
articulated more than a century before.
The final currency step of this era came in, when Finland joined the European  1878
trend of the 1870's and , with the markka at parity with the  adopted the gold standard
French franc. By pegging to gold at the same gold content as the franc, Finland 
effectively became integrated with the as a kind of 'associate  Latin Monetary Union 
member' at the time.1
Again, there was a concurrent plan to take the rouble to the gold standard as well, but 
that had to be abandoned because of the Russo-Turkish war. As a result, Russia 
followed Finland to the gold standard only two decades later in 1897.
That anchor of gold held until the First World War. It gave us credibility, capital and 
access to international markets. Many a railway or factory was built on that foundation. 
The benefit was concrete: the country could raise funds in Frankfurt, Paris and 
elsewhere  for example, for railway routes like the important Savonian line in Eastern 
Finland.
A currency is not a mere symbol. It is a bridge to the world – and to the future.
Slide 5. Currency regimes in the 20centuryth 
Fast-forward into the 20th century and we see a collection – if not a cavalcade – of 
monetary architectures. And Finland experienced most of them up close.
1915–1926: Paper standard. The First World War brought a suspension of gold 
convertibility and rapid inflation. Money served the home front first – stability was 
compromised and came only later.
1926–1931: Return to the gold standard. After the First World War, Finland  like the 
United Kingdom and others  went back on gold. But the old world where the gold 
standard had worked, had gone. Democracy and strong trade unions, and the highly 
indebted agricultural sector, made deflation, once the tool of 'internal devaluation', both 
hard and harmful. Once the Great Depression started, the deflation required by gold 
proved politically and socially untenable, as Barry Eichengreen has demonstrated.2
1931–1933: Floating exchange rate. The gold exchange standard had to be 
abandoned. Finland devalued its currency and floated, following the United Kingdom 
and the Scandinavian countries.
1933–1939: Pound peg ('the sterling area'). The markka, and the Scandinavian 
currencies, were pegged to the British pound. This fitted the trade patterns of the day: 
the UK was our main export market, above all for forest products. The economy grew 
briskly in the late 1930s.

5/13 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
1939–1949: Exchange controls. War and reconstruction required rationing of foreign 
exchange. The external constraints were tight. Controls were necessary, but they were 
costly in terms of lost efficiency. There was high inflation, and after the war there were 
several devaluations.
1949–1971/73: Bretton Woods par value system. Fixed  but adjustable  exchange 
rates anchored to the US dollar. Membership of the IMF (since 1948) and full current-
account convertibility (from 1959) tied Finland into the post-war Western economic 
order. These were years of fast growth, industrialisation and the expansion of the 
welfare state.
Between , Finland moved from postwar exchange controls to full  1959 and 1961
participation in the Bretton Woods monetary system. In, the government ended  1959
foreign-exchange rationing and restored current-account convertibility, aligning with the 
broader European liberalization of payments. Over the next two years, the Bank of 
strengthened reserves in preparation for formal entry into the IMF's framework. Finland 
This transition culminated in , when Finland September 1961  declared a par value for 
and accepted the obligations of , marking the official the markka   IMF Article VIII
completion of its monetary liberalization and full integration into the postwar 
international financial order.
Yet the economy remained volatile. The markka was devalued roughly every ten years 
from the post-war period until 1992. The lesson from this is that fixed rates alone do not 
guarantee an equilibrium and stability if economic policy is loose and wages run ahead 
of productivity.
1971/73–1991: Currency basket. When the dollar was delinked from gold and the oil 
shocks occurred, Europe and the world were compelled to improvise. Finland pegged 
the markka to a that reflected trade shares. currency basket 
In Western Europe the European Monetary System and the Exchange Rate 
Mechanism, the emerged under a de facto Deutsche mark anchor – the  EMS/ERM,  
Bundesbank was the European leader in monetary policy.
1991: European Currency Unit peg. In June 1991, Finland shifted from the trade-
weighted currency basket to a peg against the, a composite of EU currencies,  ECU
thereby tightening our link to Europe. It was as much a political as an economic 
decision, if not more.
The decision to peg the markka was taken after a serious stand-off between the new 
Government, led by Prime Minister Esko Aho, which would have preferred a 'final 
devaluation' of between 5% and 10% to correct cost competitiveness when pegging, 
and the Board of the Bank of Finland, which proposed pegging to the ECU with the then 
current exchange rates. The Board strengthened its stance by threatening to resign if 
the markka was devalued. The Government yielded at first.

But the tension did not disappear. On the contrary, Bank of Finland Governor Rolf 
Kullberg was forced to resign in April 1992, while the Government appointed Sirkka 
Hämäläinen as the new Governor. She later served on the first-ever European Central 
Bank Executive Board in 19982003.
1992–1996: Float. The early 1990s crisis  born of a failed financial liberalisation, free 
but excessive capital flows, a fixed exchange rate, lax fiscal policy and the collapse of 
Soviet trade  led to mass unemployment by 1992. In 1991, Finland's GDP fell by 7% 
and the number of people unemployed increased by 150,000.
The economic crisis and the parallel international currency crisis of September 1992 
forced Finland to let the markka float. I, for one, thought of it as –  the Last Devaluation 
the final drink before quitting the habit.  
The markka fell sharply, at one point roughly 40% against the ECU. By spring 1993, 
exports had surged and the current account turned for the better. Interest rates, then a 
key measure of trust on the economy, started finally to decline. But the cost at home 
was heavy: bankruptcies and a long, painful shake-up of balance sheets. For a long 
time, job creation failed to counter the job destruction, which was largely structural, 
occurring in the wake of events within and outside Finland.
Slides 6-8. Impossible Trinity
The period from roughly 1988 to 1992 is of particular importance from the standpoint of 
monetary policy and monetary regime choice. Finland in that period is a perfect case 
study in what is known as 'impossible trilemma' or 'trinity'.
The , also known as the ' , is a core  impossible trinity Mundell-Fleming trilemma'
concept in international macroeconomics. It states that a country cannot 
of the following policy goals:simultaneously have all three 
Free capital mobility (no restrictions on capital flows – investors can move 
money in and out freely).
A fixed exchange rate (the domestic currency's value is pegged to another 
currency or a basket of currencies).
An independent monetary policy (the central bank can set interest rates to 
achieve domestic goals, like inflation or unemployment).
In other words, a country can of these three at the same time – the  choose only two 
third must be sacrificed. In a nutshell, you cannot have a fixed exchange rate, free 
capital flows and an independent monetary policy all at once.
I must add that Professor Hélène Rey, has in her empirically grounded papers in 2013-
15, suggested a significant revision of the Trinity. Her reformulation of the trilemma into 
a captures a deeper truth about the contemporary global monetary order:  "dilemma" 
sovereignty in finance has become conditional. The global financial cycle – driven by 
the liquidity, leverage, and risk preferences of dollar-based markets – binds national

policy far more tightly than exchange-rate regimes once did. In this system, the U.S. 
, transmitting dollar functions as both a currency and a global infrastructure
financial impulses across borders and shaping the rhythm of credit worldwide.
Rey's insight thus redefines monetary autonomy not as the freedom to set interest rates 
independently, but as the capacity to manage exposure to the global balance sheet 
through macroprudential, regulatory, and institutional means. The modern challenge is 
thus not to escape interdependence, but to govern it, or at least, manage it – a task that 
lies at the heart of the post-crisis debate over the future of global finance and the 
boundaries of economic sovereignty.
Anyway, for Finland, the 'impossible trinity' was a hard lesson in the late 1980s and 
early 1990s. According to the ex-post analysis of the Finnish economic crisis of the 
1990s, the central causes behind the overheating of the late 1980s and the subsequent 
deep recession were financial market and monetary factors and monetary policy. This 
was also the conclusion of the three foreign economic experts commissioned by the 
Bank of Finland in 1993 to conduct an in-depth study.3
It is worth noting that Dr. Sirkka Hämäläinen, Governor of the Bank of Finland from 
1992 to 1998, asks in her memoirs whether it would have been possible to move 
already to a floating rate regime in the early 1980s. Some Bank of Finland economists 
had in fact analysed this matter earlier and even recommended opting for a floating 
exchange rate regime. But, as she notes, "the Governor and the majority of the Board 
did not warm to such ideas".4
Hämäläinen also concludes that even if the Governor and the Board had been ready to 
pursue a regime change to floating rates, they would have faced formidable opposition 
not only from the politicians and policymakers, but also from the export industries. 
These, as well as the labour market partners, clearly saw the exchange rates as far too 
important to be left to the whims of the markets. The export industries, both the 
corporate leaders and the trade unions, were accustomed to the support of 
devaluations when the going got tough.5
Dr. Pertti Kukkonen, one of the most perceptive and intellectually honest critics of 
central bank policy of the time, argued that a floating rate regime would have facilitated 
both a revaluation in 1988, which would have contained overheating, and an earlier 
devaluation in 1990, which would have relieved the downward spiral of production and 
employment. He regrets the collapse of the "social contract" (which was referred to then 
as 'Sorsa's contract') proposal in the autumn of 1991 and criticizes the trade unions and 
export industry for not accepting an internal devaluation, which would have been less 
costly for growth and jobs than the external one.6
As Kukkonen writes: "If the markka had been floating, monetary policy would have had 
a larger countercyclical impact, but floating did not yet fit in the realm of ideas in 
European economic policy in the 1980s."7

8/13 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
1996–1998: ERM link on the road to Economic and Monetary Union. Finland joined 
the EU in 1995. As its economy stabilised, Finland tied its exchange rate to the 
Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EU, thereby paving the way for becoming a founding 
member of the euro.
1999–today: The euro. First as a fixed euro conversion rate used only for accounting 
purposes and electronic payments; then the launch of euro coins and banknotes in 
2002.
Over time the euro's institutions have moved fromto the more robust EMU 1.0   EMU 2.0
, including a sturdier framework for European economic governance, a permanent crisis 
fund (the European Stability Mechanism, ESM), new legislation for banking regulation, 
supervision and resolution, as well as the creation of the euro area banking union under 
the auspices of the ECB.
In short, Finland has experienced floats and pegs, metals and paper, currency 
baskets and unions. Each move was a response to the conditions at the time. 
None was a magic solution. But, taken together, they represent our path from 
peripheral volatility to European stability.
Slide 9. The euro and why it was introduced
The euro was not born of romance. It was born of hard problems.
After Bretton Woods collapsed, Europe faced recurring exchange-rate crises. The EMS
/ERM worked  until it did not. In, currency pressures swept the system. German  1992
unification had shifted the centre of gravity. Capital was mobile. National politics 
clashed with monetary constraints. Competitive devaluations returned and sapped trust.
At the same time, in 1993, the Europeanmarket was established. Goods,  single 
services, labour, people and capital were to move freely. But a market without monetary 
stability is a table with one leg short. Prices, wages and interest rates cannot be 
compared if exchange rates fluctuate. Finance cannot be well integrated if currency risk 
dominates.
The euro promised three things., to end the game of beggar-thy-neighbour  First
devaluations inside Europe. , to deliver price stability under a rules-based,  Second
independent central bank system., to deepen the single market by stripping out  Third
exchange-rate costs and noise.
There were too. After the Cold War, Europe needed anchors. A  political goals 
common currency, run by a supranational central bank and embedded in law, was seen 
as a strong anchor. France and Germany made the decisive bargain: in effect, 
Europeanising the anti-inflation credibility of the Bundesbank by embedding it in a new 
European Central Bank, and binding German power within shared institutions.
The design was not perfect. The original EMU was a monetary union without a full fiscal 
and financial union. That gap would matter later. But the purpose was clear and, for 
most EU countries, compelling.

9/13 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Slide 10. Finland in the euro
Why, specifically, did Finland join?
The 1990s had taught us a hard truth – actually this was already apparent in the 1970s 
and 1980s  as we were living then in a devaluation-inflation cycle, with periodic 
devaluations following high inflation and the erosion of the competitiveness gains of the 
previous devaluation. That is with free capital movements and a fixed exchange rate, a 
small country cannot run a patchwork of lax or inconsistent policies and expect mercy 
from the markets. We needed a that could not be kicked away in a  credibility anchor 
storm. The euro offered that.
What has it brought?
Stability, first of all. Compared with the early 1990s, the euro years – since its creation 
in 1999 – have delivered low and predictable inflation, lower interest rates, and a more 
even cost of capital.
Trade and investment have benefited from the removal of currency risk within the euro 
area. have gained from price transparency and ease of payments. Households    
have gained from a deeper market for finance and customers.Businesses 
Slide 11. Responses to the financial crises
After almost a decade of the euro, came the litmus test – or the moment of truth.
The global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis exposed the faults of 
. A single monetary policy alongside many nationally regulated banking EMU 1.0
systems and national fiscal policies can breed imbalances when credit flows too quickly 
in some parts of the network. When the tide went out, such imbalances left weak banks, 
fragile sovereign finances, and a dangerous feedback loop between the two.
Europe's answer, though slow, was real and resolute. It built awith  banking union 
common supervision and resolution. It created a permanent crisis fund, the 
. The ECB acted as a central bank should in a European Stability Mechanism (ESM)
crisis: lender of last resort to the system, guardian of the payments backbone, and, in 
exceptional times, buyer of last resort to prevent self-fulfilling panics.
The architecture moved towards . Not perfect, but stronger. EMU 2.0
It has provided resilience during the many crises of the 2020s, from the COVID-19 
pandemic to the economic consequences of Russia's illegal war in Ukraine, including 
the subsequent energy crisis and inflationary surge.
But still the euro and EMU are very much work in progress.
For Finland the core lesson is not new. A country in a currency union must keep its 
aligned with productivity. It must keep its resilient, competitiveness   public finances 
not just for today, but for the next shock and for the realities of an ageing society. Wage-

setting must be moderate enough to support employment in a small, open economy. 
Innovation and education must feed productivity – human capital matters. Finance must 
be well supervised and capitalized.
The euro does not do these jobs for us. But it makes success in these more likely if we 
do our own job well as a society.
Slide 12. New challenges for the international monetary system
The next chapter in this story is being written on two fronts at once.
First, . The world is less rules-based and more power-based  geopolitical confrontation
than a decade ago. Tensions between the United States and China run through trade, 
technology and finance. Sanctions and export controls have become standard tools. 
Payment systems and reserve currencies are viewed and used as instruments of 
statecraft.
The remains . Market depth, ample liquidity  US dollar   the dominant reserve currency
and the rule of law can keep it at the top. But the use of financial sanctions is 
encouraging some countries to seek partial workarounds: more trade invoicing in other 
currencies, regional payment systems, and local currency swaps.
Escalating geopolitical tensions, trade wars and volatile policy shifts are reshaping the 
rules of global finance. While the US dollar will likely remain dominant, its supremacy 
may become somewhat less hegemonic in the evolving more multipolar world economy.
As to the euro, it is a solid regional reserve currency, and globally distant second – for 
the euro to become , Europe will need to act  a more broadly usedglobalanchor   
strategically and reduce its dependencies.
Europe must not simply drift in this global environment. It must strengthen its economic 
base, reduce strategic dependencies and be able to stand on its own feet - while 
keeping alliances strong.
The second front is . Here the words are new, but the  technological disruption
questions are old: Who issues money? Who controls the payment rails? And who bears 
the risk?
Crypto-assets without backing promise much but deliver little as money. They 
are volatile and speculative. They fail the tests of unit of account and stable store 
of value.
Stablecoins are different in design. They promise a claim on safe assets  say, 
short-term government bills  wrapped in a token that moves fast on new rails. The 
EU now has a for crypto-assets and stablecoins. The US  harmonised rulebook 
has moved to a more permissive model with strict reserve requirements for 
issuers. There is room for coordination between the EU and the US, but the 
politics have not yet reached this point.
Tokenised deposits are the banking sector's answer. They keep money inside 
the regulated system, make it movable on new infrastructures, and allow 
programmability without breaking the link to insured deposits and central bank

households and businesses, designed to be private by default for small payments 
and safe by design for all. It would . It would  complement, not replace, cash

Slide 13. A stronger international role for the euro
A stronger international role for the euro is increasingly seen as desirable. But it 
requires a stronger, more dynamic Europe. Both in terms of its security and its economy.
The euro's global weight ultimately depends on the vitality of the economy behind it. 
That is why the path forward rests on three key priorities: Defence, Dynamism and 
Digital Sovereignty.
The first D is Defence  and security as an economic asset. Russia's war of 
aggression in Ukraine has reminded us, painfully, that security and economics are 
.inseparable
The second D is  the engine of Europe's prosperity and the foundation of  Dynamism  
the euro's strength. The lesson is simple: a currency cannot be stronger than the 
economy it represents.
The third D is  perhaps the most strategic frontier of all. In this  Digital Sovereignty 
arena, Europe is far too dependent on non-European platforms and payment systems.
At the same time, are spreading rapidly, aiming at  US dollar-backed stablecoins 
extending dollar dominance into digital finance.
Europe is not ignoring this shift. That's why theis important. digital euro 
Together, the three Ds form a coherent strategy for a stronger Europe and a 
. And all three support one another: requires a stronger euro  a credible defence 
dynamic economy to fund it; benefits from digital innovation; and economic dynamism    
, in turn, depends on both secure infrastructure and economic scale.digital sovereignty
Technology also changes power. If the rails of payments are controlled from afar, 
sovereignty is eroded. If key platforms are private and foreign, policy levers shrink. This 
is why, in the 2020s, means monetary sovereignty. Europe should  digital sovereignty 
ensure the backbone of its payment infrastructure remains open, interoperable and 
resilient  but it must not be naïve about this.
One more hard fact, if I may. A global currency needs a behind  deep, liquid safe asset 
it. The US has its Treasury securities. The EU has a patchwork. Its joint issuance has 
grown in recent years for specific common purposes, but a larger, permanent pool of 

12/13 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
safe euro-denominated assets anchored in sound fiscal rules would help integrate 
capital markets and strengthen the euro's international role. Defence and security, if 
funded wisely together, could form both a shield and a financial mainstay.
Slide 14. General conclusions
This brings us now to my conclusions. I will summarise five key lessons.
First, money is backed by the state and tested by the market. Its  a social contract 
three jobs  exchange, account, store  are simple to state and hard to maintain.
Institutions and credibility do the heavy lifting. However, there is .  no perfect regime
Fixed exchange rates bring discipline but can become a straitjacket. Floating rates bring 
flexibility but can tempt drift and reduce credibility. A currency union brings stability of 
prices and payments, but it demands that members keep their own houses in order.
Second , Finland's path shows that , not fate.  currency choice is the result of policy
We moved from rouble instability to silver, from silver to gold, from pegs to floats, from 
baskets to the euro.
Each shift matched a need: to attract capital, to stabilise trade, to escape crisis, or to 
anchor expectations.
Today, with Finland in the euro, there is . We must keep  work that only we can do
competitiveness aligned with productivity. We must keep public finances resilient in an 
ageing society. We must invest in education, research and innovation. We must 
supervise the financial sector well. We must ensure that wage-setting supports 
employment in our small, open economy. These are not tasks for Brussels, or Frankfurt. 
They are ours.
Third, the euro is a . It brought to an end the European habit of  stability project
competitive devaluations. It delivered low inflation and deepened the single market. Its 
first design had gaps in it, but its second design is sturdier.
The task now for the EU is to finish the job. This means completing the banking union in 
practice, building a true capital markets union, and ensuring that fiscal rules are simple,
