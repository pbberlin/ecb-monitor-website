1 Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen,
Right off the bat, I have a question for you about Goethe's Faust–and I'm thinking of 
both parts. Do you think Mephistopheles came across more as a lawyer or an 
economist? 
The famous pact between Faust and the devil is evocative of the signing of a legal 
contract. But on the other hand, in part two of the tragedy Mephistopheles acts as an 
economic player in the money creation scene: he creates paper money to remedy the 
emperor's lack of currency. That ultimately leads to inflation. If you ask an AI chatbot, 
say, the answer isn't totally clear. Mephistopheles has both legal and economic 
aspects. He embodies both roles. 
The fact is that there are many interfaces between law and economics. And some 
universities even unite the two disciplines under the umbrella of one faculty. Another 
thing our specialisms probably share is being considered "dry as dust". And our jargon 
is often comprehensible only to insiders. Impenetrable walls of paragraphs or models 
that seem like closed books.
By contrast, I hope that my brief speech today will be entertaining and easily 
understood even by non-experts. I would like to give an overview of sorts of current 
issues–and, in keeping with the title of the event, provide "Frankfurt impulses". Let me 
begin with geopolitical developments; followed by a look first at Germany and then at 
Europe. To finish, I would like to say a few words about central banks and monetary 
policy.
2 Changed geopolitical conditions
The  19 pandemic, the more politicised Chinese economy and the war in COVID-
Ukraine have already shown that it is important to reduce economic dependencies. 
Geoeconomic considerations are increasingly playing a role. The change of 
administration in the United States has once again altered the landscape enormously.
US tariff policy is calling into question the multilateral trading system more than ever. 
Universal rules have to make way for deals on trade policy. And the stronger party 
prevails–though who that actually is sometimes only becomes apparent over time. 
International cooperation is suffering.

2/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
After multiple decades of advancing global integration, the global economy is at risk of 
becoming fragmented. That is very regrettable and also costly to the economy. You 
see, international trade and the division of labour increase productivity and welfare.
We should not be dramatising current developments, nor should we be downplaying 
them. The United States is a key player. If it pulls back from international cooperation, 
that will leave a mark. US imports make up around 13% of global trade, for example. 
Trade restrictions have increased worldwide. Although new trade agreements have also 
been made at the same time, this does not compensate for the damage.
The fact that the United States is somewhat cutting itself off economically with its 
protectionist measures is one thing. But the fact that the changed geopolitical conditions 
are accompanied by much greater uncertainty is also putting additional strain on global 
economic activity. Germany and Europe are therefore facing economic pressures and 
challenges.
The higher tariffs have so far had less of an impact on the global economy than was 
feared at times, but their negative consequences are likely to increase. The United 
States accounts for a share of around one-fifth of German and European exports to 
countries outside the European Union. Exchange rate developments are another 
complicating factor for domestic export business.1
The euro has appreciated by more than 12% against the US dollar since the beginning 
of the year. Compared with the currencies of 18 trading partners, euro appreciation 
came to just over 5.5%. In my opinion, the current valuation level of the euro is not 
concerning. After all, the dollar exchange rate, which is currently sitting at around €1.16, 
is not far from its historical average. However, the appreciation of the euro has led to a 
further deterioration in the price competitiveness of the German economy and the euro 
area. According to Bundesbank calculations, it is no longer favourable, but rather 
neutral.2
How should we respond to all this? Europe and Germany need to position themselves 
in the fragmented world as well as they can. We must be careful not to get crushed in 
the geostrategic conflict between the United States and China. We should work more 
closely with countries that are also interested in open, rules-based trade. The 
agreement between Mercosur and the European Union is a good example. However, 
new free trade agreements should be negotiated much faster than the Mercosur 
agreement, which took more than 25 years. Above all, it is high time we became more 
competitive and more independent. I would now like to move on to the situation and 
outlook in Germany.
3 Strengthening Germany's economic strength in the long term
The German economy stagnated in the third quarter. It will probably grow only slightly 
overall this year. It is likely that growth will be more pronounced next year. However, the 
likely increase in government spending is a major factor in this.

3/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
For our economy to grow stronger again in the long term, it must become more 
productive, regain lost competitiveness and generally make better use of its 
opportunities. This means creating a favourable environment for investment and 
innovation, for example by reducing bureaucracy and easing regulation.
We must not fall behind, especially with regard to future technologies such as artificial 
intelligence. And it is extremely important to restructure the energy sector in a way that 
is both climate-friendly and economically sound, and to make the energy sector and 
energy markets in Europe more interlinked. Lower energy prices would benefit 
household finances and make Germany a cheaper location for businesses. More 
integrated energy markets can reduce price fluctuations.
Furthermore, Germany also needs to have enough labour to sustain higher economic 
growth. Younger working-age people are steadily declining in both absolute numbers 
and as a share of the population. At the same time, life expectancy keeps rising. 
Therefore it is virtually inevitable that we will have to keep working for longer. This also 
means making early retirement less attractive. First, because otherwise the burden on 
the shoulders of the young generations will get heavier and heavier. Second, because 
early retirement exacerbates the shortage of skilled workers. For the same reason, 
labour market-oriented immigration will become even more important than it already is.
In short: higher government spending for more public investment is one thing. However, 
this needs to be accompanied by reforms that sustainably strengthen Germany as a 
business location. The same goes for Europe.
4 Europe should move closer together
At the European level, I see no problem in terms of analysis, but in terms of 
implementation. It is important to press ahead decisively with structural reforms and 
European integration. To this end, the struggle for national advantages must take a 
back seat. Global challenges mean that compromise–in the sense of mutual give-and-
take–is becoming more important than ever. Ultimately, everyone benefits from closer 
cooperation.
The need to build up common defence capabilities in Europe is particularly acute. And 
"Europe" here means not only the European Union, but also partners such as Norway 
or the United Kingdom. Europe should also move closer together in pursuit of economic 
strength and sovereignty. 
First, there are still considerable obstacles in our internal market. This is particularly 
true in the services sector. And we do not have a common energy market. Around 
450 million people are an immense economic area whose potential can be better 
harnessed. 
The reports by Mario Draghiand Enrico Lettahave been available for more than a 3  4 
year now. They contain plenty of good proposals. But there is a lack of implementation. 
The European single market is a success story that we should definitely continue–as 
also shown by a recent Bundesbank study.5

4/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Second, financial integration in Europe must progress. We have been talking about the 
capital markets union for more than ten years now. The objective of a savings and 
investments union has now evolved. But it is still not being implemented. 
What does it need to achieve? The main objective is to channel more of European 
households' high savings into productive investment and innovative enterprises. 
Households are likely to benefit from this, both through higher earnings and lower risks. 
Businesses would benefit from a larger and more diverse capital supply and a reduction 
in capital costs. At the same time, the savings and investments union would make 
Europe more independent in terms of financing sources, including and especially for 
young, innovative businesses.
Third, a European central bank digital currency could counteract the remaining 
fragmentation within Europe and make us more independent when it comes to payment 
systems. Two forms have been proposed: one for large-value payments that only banks 
can use; and one for everyone to use as a complement to cash, transferring its benefits 
to the digital payment world. This digital euro would be accessible to all citizens free of 
charge and would be accepted throughout the euro area. It would be based on 
European infrastructure. This would make us more independent ofUS payment service    
providers such as Visa, Mastercard or PayPal. 
The introduction of the digital euro will depend on the adoption of the relevant legal 
basis in Brussels. Provided that the legislation enters into force in 2026, the Eurosystem 
should be able to introduce the digital euro in 2029.European central bank digital 6 
currency would, not least, also be a sensible response toUS dollar-denominated    
stablecoins. This is because it would strengthen the attractiveness of the euro.
The emergence of stablecoins is a recent and, to some extent, worrying development. 
These are digital tokens from private issuers that aim to maintain a stable value and are 
backed by assets such as government bonds for this purpose. Stablecoins, which 
currently mean almost exclusivelyUS dollar-denominated stablecoins, could become    
more widespread: This is because they offer advantages over existing solutions in 
certain fields of application, such as payments between firms or between different 
currency areas. And also becauseUS regulation aims to safeguard or further expand    
the dominance of theUS dollar through stablecoins.   
In plain terms: Europe's sovereignty in payments would be at risk if stablecoins issued 
by US companies were used extensively here. European central bank digital currency    
alone would certainly not prevent this from happening. This makes euro-pegged 
stablecoins from European issuers all the more important. At present, these are still few 
and far between.
5 Central bank independence is a precious asset
Another current development is giving pause for thought. Namely how the 
independence of theUS Federal Reserve is under pressure. Likewise, the lawyers    
among you are probably watching with particular concern wherever the independence 
of the judiciary is at risk. Central bank independence is a major achievement. It's part of 

5/6 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
theDNA of a successful, effective monetary policy. While public debates and differing    
opinions on the course of monetary policy are useful, there shouldn't be political 
interference.
A look back at history provides cautionary tales of what can happen if central banks do 
not act independently: The public loses confidence in monetary policy. There is turmoil 
in the financial market. Independence is an important prerequisite for us as central 
banks to be able to fulfil our mandate of ensuring price stability. Monetary policy should 
not, for example, be geared towards public finances, with key interest rates lowered 
more sharply than warranted by the objective of price stability.
Let me add that, in return for their independence, central banks should have a clearly 
defined mandate. However, this does not prevent them from taking a far-sighted 
approach to economic challenges. For example, we need to analyse and take into 
account the increasing risks posed by climate change. This is because they, too, are 
relevant for price and financial stability.
Before I conclude, you will probably want to hear me say something about European 
monetary policy. Euro area inflation has stabilised close to 2% in recent months. 
According to previousECB staff projections, inflation is likely to be close to the 2%    
target over the medium term.
However, some aftereffects of the wave of inflation are still being felt. Take supermarket 
inflation, for example. For food, in particular, price increases were above average and 
remain persistent. TheECB recently wrote that to put a meal on the table, consumers    
are paying roughly a third more than before the pandemic.At their regular trips to the 7 
supermarket, people perceive the increased cost of living particularly clearly. And their 
concerns about further price rises are reflected in survey results.The Governing 8 
Council of theECB is, of course, keeping a close eye on this and the continued strong    
services inflation.
We are in a good position and should continue to follow a data-dependent and flexible 
approach and take our decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis. In December, we will 
have additional data, new projections for the next two years and also–for the first 
time–for 2028. We will then see more clearly whether the monetary policy stance 
remains appropriate. 
6 Conclusion
I would like to conclude by noting that much of what seemed self-evident for a long time 
is no longer so. For example, how important it is to have credible, predictable, and 
sustainable policies that strive for international cooperation, not confrontation. Such 
policies also create the framework for economic success.
Europe must hold its own in this changed world. I have mentioned a few key factors for 
success: Increasing productivity and competitiveness. Promoting European 
sovereignty. To this end, working more closely together in Europe and implementing the 
necessary measures: First, deepening the single market. Second, finally making 
progress on the savings and investments union. Third, introducing European central 
bank digital currency.

What is also important is the quality and reliability of institutions, including an 
independent central bank, an independent judiciary and, of course, the preservation of 
our democracy. Professor Friedman, in the opening passage of your latest book, you 
note that the attack on our liberal democracy is the most serious it has been since the 
1930s. However, the end of your  A free Europe could be history in a few years' time. 
book gives us hope that democracy will evolve. You point out that we may well stumble 
along the way. In my view, stumbling from time to time is certainly preferable to not 
making any progress at all.
I would now like to hand over the floor and thank you for your attention.
