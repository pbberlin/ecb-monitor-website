2024 – 131st Financial Year
Rome, 30 May 2025



Ladies and Gentlemen,
T rade disputes and the ongoing conflicts are undermining confidence at 
the international level, casting a shadow over the global economic outlook. In 
recent weeks, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded its global 
growth projections for the next two years, to less than 3 per cent, well below the 
average recorded in past decades. 
Concerns over a potential trade war intensified on 2 April, when the 
United States introduced sweeping tariff hikes, which were partly paused in 
the weeks that followed. The announcement sparked significant volatility 
in the financial markets, with firms most exposed to international trade hit 
hardest. Investors shifted towards assets that are considered safer, pushing the 
price of gold to new all-time highs.
Unlike in previous periods of uncertainty, the yields on long-term US 
T reasury bonds decreased and the dollar depreciated (Figure 1.a). This trend 
persisted in the weeks that followed, despite a partial easing of financial 
tensions and a rebound in stock prices. This raises important questions about 
the future structure of the international monetary system and the dominant 
role of the US dollar as both a reserve and a trade invoicing currency.1
We are witnessing deep fissures in the very equilibrium that has 
underpinned the global economy for decades. While the policies of the US 
administration are the primary trigger, they are part of an already rapidly 
changing landscape.
A global economy amid uncertainty and change
The current trade disputes are partly driven by growing discontent with 
globalization and disenchantment with the unfulfilled promises of free trade. 
Since the great financial crisis, a widespread perception has taken hold in 
many advanced economies that globalization has exacerbated inequality and 
reduced employment opportunities for lower-skilled workers. In reality, these 
developments are largely a consequence of technological progress, as well as of 
distortions caused by unfair trade practices, such as the substantial subsidies 
granted by some emerging economies to their manufacturing sectors.

Meanwhile, many low-income countries remain trapped in poverty and 
burdened by high levels of debt, despite the opportunities presented by an 
integrated global economy and the financial aid provided by the international 
community. Discontent has grown among emerging economies – which have 
benefited greatly from trade liberalization 2 – over the lack of recognition, 
within the governance of international institutions, of their increasingly 
important role in the global economy. 
As a result, consensus around a framework based on shared rules, open 
markets, and multilateral cooperation has gradually weakened. 
Against this backdrop, the protectionist policies adopted by the US 
reflect its declared aim of reviving domestic manufacturing and correcting 
trade imbalances, particularly vis-à-vis China. 
The announcement of high tariffs, it would appear, is being used as a 
bargaining tool to redefine international economic and political relations. 
However, the effects of this strategy are difficult to predict and manage. 
Although the tariffs currently in force in the US are lower than those 
announced in early April, they are the highest since the Second World War 
and are causing a notable increase in average tariffs worldwide (Figure 1.b).

Annual Report 2024
Their potential impact is now significantly greater than in the past, owing to 
the close integration of the global economy.
The higher trade barriers could shave nearly 1 percentage point off global 
growth over a two-year period. 
The estimated impact on the US economy would be roughly double that. 
The tariffs could lead to lower labour demand and heightened inflationary 
pressures, at a time when inflation expectations are already rising. They are also 
weighing on household and business confidence, with potential repercussions 
on consumption and investment. 
The stream of announcements, retractions and revisions is fuelling 
uncertainty and volatility in the markets. These conditions risk amplifying the 
effects of the tariffs and could persist for some time, given the complexity of 
trade negotiations, which typically take far longer than the 90-day suspension 
announced. 
Higher trade barriers are unlikely to correct the large US trade deficit, 
which mainly reflects imbalances driven by strong domestic demand in an 
economy close to full employment. A correction would require reducing 
consumption or investment, which would be accompanied by lower inflows 
of foreign capital.3
The medium-term effects of the tariffs on the global economy will 
depend on the ability of countries and firms to redirect international trade 
and forge new trade relations. Chinese firms, for example, are expanding 
their presence abroad by leveraging technological advantages and adopting 
aggressive pricing policies to absorb excess capacity. 
Protectionist policies are steering the global economy onto a perilous 
course. The tariffs currently in effect could reduce international trade by 
around 5 per cent, prompting a reconfiguration of global supply chains. This 
would lead to less integrated and less efficient trading systems.
The effects risk spilling over beyond trade, altering the structure of the 
international monetary system, currently centred on the US dollar, and 
restricting capital flows. 
They could go further still, hampering the movement of people, ideas and 
knowledge. Weaker global cooperation, including in science and technology, 
would ultimately reduce incentives for innovation and hinder progress. Over 
time, the very foundations of shared prosperity would be compromised.
Yet perhaps the most far-reaching risk lies elsewhere: that trade, once 
a driver of integration and dialogue, becomes a source of division, fuelling  
political instability and endangering peace.

The globalization of services
Somewhat surprisingly, current trade disputes continue to revolve around 
goods trade, despite the growing role of services in the global economy. The 
United States has a large surplus in this sector, including with the European 
Union, especially in digital services (Figure 2.a).
Since the global financial crisis, international trade in services has 
grown faster than trade in goods (Figure 2.b), reaching 15 per cent of world 
GDP , one quarter of total trade and one third of transactions within global 
supply chains. Even within trade in goods, the share attributable to services 
– such as marketing, design and after-sales support – accounts for a growing 
portion of value added. 
The main driver of this expansion has been digitalization, which has 
made it easier to provide services remotely.4 Over the last twenty years, trade 
in digital services has grown at an average annual rate of 8 per cent, twice as 
fast as traditional services such as tourism and transportation. 
As was the case for goods in the past, trade in services may prove to 
be a powerful engine of productivity growth, 5 helping to narrow gaps 
between countries and contain inflation. However, for this transition to 
be sustainable, it must be combined with social protection systems and

targeted investment in human capital, so as to safeguard the workers most 
exposed to technological change. 
Insidious risks are inherent in the concentration of power in a few 
large global corporations which steer technological innovation, control vast 
troves of data and threaten competition. The combined market value of 
the seven leading US tech companies today exceeds $15 trillion. Given this 
scenario, effective regulation that protects consumer rights, media plurality 
and competition – without stifling innovation – is essential.
Global public debt
Over the last fifteen years, the global debt-to-GDP ratio has risen 
significantly, with a marked acceleration in the two largest world economies 
(Figure 3). 
This trend partly reflects the series of global shocks – from the 2008 
financial crisis to the pandemic and the energy crisis – that have disrupted 
economic activity and necessitated extraordinary government intervention.
The high level of debt exposes economies to volatility in sovereign debt 
markets and limits the room for manoeuvre in the event of a crisis.

Low-income economies face severe tensions.6 In just over 15 years, their 
debt-to-GDP ratio has doubled and debt servicing costs have soared, diverting 
crucial resources from growth and development. 7 More than half of these 
countries are currently in a highly vulnerable position,8 and a significant share 
of their debt is due to mature in the next two years. 
A larger share of this debt is now held by foreign creditors. Alongside 
multilateral institutions and the governments of advanced countries, new 
actors, such as China and a growing number of private investors, have come 
to the fore. Such a diverse pool of creditors, compounded by the deterioration 
in international relations, makes it more difficult to find shared solutions and 
to manage potential crises in a coordinated way. 
It is crucial to strengthen the G20’s Common Framework for restructuring 
the debt of low-income countries, which has been little used so far because 
of procedural obstacles. We need more effective cooperation between 
stakeholders, so as to overcome the challenges posed by disagreements 
between countries. Although the debt of low-income countries accounts for 
just a small share of the world economy, reducing it is essential, not only to 
limit global financial risks, but above all to create prospects for prosperity for 
more than one billion people.
Lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio is also key for the advanced economies 
in order to free up resources for development. This requires policies that can 
boost growth through reforms, innovation and education. At the same time, 
it is essential to embark on a path of fiscal consolidation that is both credible 
and gradual: credible, to bolster confidence in the sustainability of public 
finances; gradual, to prevent setbacks to growth and head off unacceptable 
social costs. 
Equity is critical to the success of any reform strategy. Without social 
consensus, no fiscal policy is sustainable in the long term.
The economic outlook and monetary policy in the euro area
The real economy and inflation
After a long period of stagnation, the euro-area economy returned to growth 
in 2024, though at a rate below its potential.9 Once again, Germany failed to 
provide its decisive contribution. 
Domestic demand remained below expectations, despite some signs 
of recovery. The fallout from the energy crisis, the still restrictive monetary 

BANCA D’ITALIA The Governor’s Concluding Remarks

policy stance and the widespread uncertainty dampened consumption and 
investment, which was affected by the weakness of the manufacturing sector.
The support from foreign demand also faltered, reflecting the deterioration 
in the global economy.
In the first quarter of this year, GDP rose by 0.3 per cent. Industrial 
production, while showing signs of stabilization, remains well below the 
levels recorded prior to the energy crisis, especially in Germany and Italy.
In this context, the return of inflation to close to 2 per cent is a positive 
sign (Figure 4.a). This is partly due to wage pressures easing: the recovery in 
real wages is well on track and new contracts provide for significantly smaller 
increases than in the past two years.
Outlook and risks
Protectionist policies loom over the fragile recovery outlook. The outcome 
of trade negotiations is uncertain, but the impact on the European economy 
is bound to be significant.
The United States is the main outlet market for euro-area products, 
absorbing almost one fifth of exports. Some of the sectors most exposed to 
tariffs – such as transport equipment, machinery and beverages – are already 
showing signs of declining confidence, weakening order expectations and 
deteriorating employment prospects.

Tariff barriers could also reduce demand for European products 
indirectly by holding back the global economy. In addition, China and some  
South-East Asian countries, which all have excess production capacity and large 
trade surpluses with the US, are likely to seek new outlets to counter the effect 
of the tariffs, thus exacerbating competitive pressures on European markets. 
Uncertainty about trade policies hinders business planning and raises 
firms’ borrowing costs. Following the April announcements, European 
equities fell sharply, amid rising volatility and widening credit and liquidity 
risk premiums.
T ensions have since subsided and have not affected financial stability, 
thanks to the soundness of the European banking system and to the 
improvement in the public finances of vulnerable countries. However, 
investor confidence is still wavering.
In recent weeks, the IMF and the European  Commission have cut their 
growth forecasts for the next two years by about half a percentage point 
(Figure 4.b). 
On the inflation front, energy prices have fallen considerably and the euro 
has strengthened. T ogether with weak economic growth and intense global 
competition, these developments could dampen consumer price inflation. 
Market expectations point to inflation returning to below 2 per cent as early as 
the second half of this year and decreasing to 1.7 per cent on average in 2026.
This is an unsettled economic outlook.
A further appreciation of the euro, growing uncertainty or tighter financial 
conditions could magnify the recessionary impact of the tariffs. Moreover, a 
larger-than-expected increase in Chinese exports to Europe could push down 
production and inflation.10
Conversely, swift and tangible progress in trade negotiations would 
mitigate downside risks to economic activity. The anticipated increase in 
public spending in Europe could support growth, with the effects appearing 
gradually over time. Disruptions to global supply chains would put upward 
pressure on inflation.
Monetary policy
Past concerns about the disinflation process have proved unfounded. 
The credibility of the European Central Bank’s action has kept expectations 
anchored to the 2 per cent target, preventing the recovery in real wages from 
triggering the feared wage-price spiral. Core inflation has declined at a pace 

BANCA D’ITALIA The Governor’s Concluding Remarks

consistent with past experience, while persisting somewhat in services. Even 
the ‘last mile’ has not proved particularly challenging so far.11
On the whole, disinflation has not taken too high a toll on the economy 
and is now close to completion. The cuts in the ECB’s key interest rate, 
amounting to 1.75 percentage points over the past year, are feeding into 
financial conditions and will support economic activity over the next few 
months.
Charting the course of monetary policy in the coming months will be 
far from easy. 
Decisions will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, weighing up 
available data and the outlook for inflation and growth. 
The previous cuts clearly leave less room for reducing interest rates further. 
However, the macroeconomic outlook remains weak and trade tensions could 
cause it to deteriorate, though it is hard to say how and when that might play 
out.
It will be essential to maintain a pragmatic and flexible approach,12 while 
closely monitoring liquidity conditions and signals from financial and credit 
markets.
The ECB Governing Council has already proved able to act decisively 
and swiftly to safeguard monetary and financial stability, and will continue to 
do so in the future.
The European Union: rethinking the growth model
The European economy is showing clear structural weaknesses. Stagnating 
productivity and lagging innovation are curbing its growth potential. Its 
dependence on foreign markets, both in acquiring supplies and in selling 
its products, makes it more vulnerable in an increasingly fragmented global 
environment. We need to rethink the growth model that has supported 
Europe for decades.
Productivity and innovation
Over the past 30 years, labour productivity in the European Union has 
grown by 40 per cent, more than 25 percentage points below the figure for 
the United States.13 The gap has widened since 2019: productivity in Europe 
has increased by just 2 per cent, against 10 per cent in the US, where gains 
have been driven mainly by high-tech sectors.

BANCA D’ITALIAThe Governor’s Concluding Remarks
Annual Report 2024

This gap reflects above all the difficulties in fostering innovation. 
As a share of GDP , European firms only invest half of what US firms 
do in research and development. 14 In Europe, most of the investments are 
made by long-established firms in mid-tech sectors, such as the automotive 
industry. Investments by young and innovative firms – many of which 
choose to relocate abroad – account for a smaller share. Conversely, 
the US business environment is constantly being renewed by new firms 
capable of succeeding in dynamic markets; 15 investment in research is 
concentrated in digital and knowledge-intensive services. 
Public spending on research and development in Europe is comparable 
in size to that of the US, but is fragmented among Member States. 16 The 
lack of effective coordination limits the scope for carrying out projects 
on a European scale. 
Despite China’s rapid rise, Europe remains a top player in scientific 
research, on an equal footing with the US in many high-tech sectors. 
However, this leading position does not translate into product innovation: 
the number of patents remains low, especially in the digital field. In 
artificial intelligence, for example, the number of European patents is 
less than one fifth of those filed in the US, despite a much smaller gap 
(around 30 per cent) in scientific output. 17
Trade openness
The degree of trade openness of the European economy, which had 
already been on the rise since the beginning of the century, expanded 
further after the global financial crisis, when policies geared towards 
external competitiveness and fiscal austerity squeezed domestic demand. 18 
The trade surplus has quadrupled, reaching 3.2 per cent of GDP , while 
consumption and investment have declined as a share of GDP . 
As a result, Europe has increased its trade openness compared with the 
United States and overtaken China (Figure 5.a). In some areas, however, 
its openness has translated into a dependence on foreign markets and 
countries. 
Europe’s energy needs rely heavily on foreign sources: about two 
thirds of the energy consumed comes from fossil fuels, almost all of 
which are imported. Dependence on China is also very high for many 
strategic goods, especially those relating to the energy transition and 
high-tech products (Figure 5.b).

Manufacturing, services and energy 
Manufacturing is still an important component of the European 
economy, where it accounts for 15 per cent of GDP – 20 per cent in Germany –  
compared with 10 per cent in the United States. However, competition 
from the emerging economies has been eroding Europe’s competitive edge, 
including in medium- and high-tech sectors, putting the resilience of entire 
production chains at risk. China in particular has continued to increase its 
share of global manufacturing (Figure 6), by leveraging technology, low 
costs and tight control over value chains.
In services, Europe’s external surplus – though substantial – stems mainly 
from traditional sectors such as tourism and transport, while in the United 
States it is driven by digital specialization.

The issue of high energy costs remains unresolved. Following the invasion 
of Ukraine, energy costs for European industries have increased significantly, 
widening the gap with the other major economies. By mid-2024, the cost of 
electricity in Europe was twice as high as in the US and China and one fifth 
higher than in Japan. 
This disadvantage curbs investment and undermines competitiveness, 
increasing the risk of firms relocating abroad. Resolute action is needed to 
reconcile containing energy costs with the decarbonization process. The 
European Commission has recently provided guidance to that effect. 19 
However, as I have noted in the past, 20 an effective energy transition also 
requires taking account of its social and production issues, striking the right 
balance between ambition and feasibility.
Triggering change
The European economy requires swift and structural action. What is 
needed is an adequately funded reform programme with a clear timeline, 
based on proposals already put forward at EU level.21 
It is necessary to remove the remaining internal barriers to the movement 
of goods, capital and people, and to invest in technology, common 
infrastructure and sectors with high growth potential.

Annual Report 2024
In an increasingly unstable global landscape, strengthening strategic 
autonomy must be a top priority. 
The European Commission’s Competitiveness Compass 22 points in 
the right direction, but it does not address the crucial issue of how to raise the 
necessary funds. Several estimates suggest that supporting the green and digital 
transitions and reinforcing the EU’s defence capabilities will require €800 billion 
per year until 2030.23 This is a sizeable amount, yet it only covers part of the 
overall financial needs. Making Europe truly competitive will require even 
greater investments. 
A commitment of this scale cannot rely solely on national budgets, nor 
can it rely on the private sector alone. As I have recently argued, what is 
needed is a true European ‘productivity compact’.24 
On the one hand, the public sector is essential for financing European 
public goods – from energy security to defence and including basic research –  
and for supporting initiatives that have collective benefits, returns over a long 
horizon, and at the same time more uncertain outcomes.
On the other hand, mobilizing private capital is key to financing 
innovative business projects. T o do so, we must urgently complete the creation 
of a fully integrated European capital market, capable of channelling savings 
towards long-term, risky investments – including through the development 
of venture capital and private equity funds on a European scale. 
This will require regulatory changes,25 to which I will come back shortly. 
However, eliminating the fragmentation of the capital market along national 
lines at its root means introducing a European safe asset with a dual purpose: 
financing the public component of investment and providing a sound and 
credible common benchmark for the entire financial system.
Our estimates suggest that an integrated capital market, centred on a 
European safe asset, would lower financing costs for businesses, resulting in 
additional investment of €150 billion per year and increasing GDP by 1.5 
per cent in the long run. The effect on GDP could be up to three times larger 
if the new investments were directed towards innovative high-tech projects. 
This effect would be greater if a single, well-structured and liquid capital 
market – providing better opportunities for diversification – were able to 
attract resources from abroad.
The experience of NextGenerationEU shows that it is possible to finance an 
ambitious European investment plan through the issuance of common public 
debt without having to create a fiscal union or introduce an EU finance ministry.

Security and defence spending
The new international context has made it clear that Europe needs to step 
up its defence capabilities. Achieving this goal will require a shared strategy 
among Member States, a sound common governance framework and sizeable 
investment.26 
The Commission’s proposal27 relies on national funding and loans, rather 
than on European spending and transfers financed using common funds. Such 
an approach risks widening the disparities between Member States and making 
spending less effective. What we actually need is a common programme, 
supported by European debt. 
A commitment of this scale must have a clear foundation. 
Common resources should be allocated by prioritizing technology and 
research in defence. At national level, ramping up defence spending should not 
come at the expense of growth-boosting investments and social expenditure. 
Most importantly, promoting international cooperation and peace must 
remain at the heart of European action. 
Investing together in security and defence does not mean entering an 
arms race, but rather taking a realistic stance in response to common threats 
that no individual country can tackle alone. Only in this way can security 
become a pillar of European solidarity: the kind of solidarity that not only 
protects but also generates prosperity, cohesion and trust.
The Italian economy
I have commented on the Italian economy’s long period of stagnation on 
past occasions. 
Over the last five years, however, despite the pandemic and energy crises, 
the country has displayed signs of a renewed economic vigour. 
Growth was greater than in the euro area. GDP grew by about 6 per 
cent, driven by an increase of almost 10 per cent in the private sector. 28 
Alongside construction, a significant contribution also came from services, 
which have been expanding in both the traditional and the advanced sectors. 
The number of people in employment has increased by around one million, 
and is now at a historical high of over 24 million, whereas the unemployment 
rate has fallen from 10 to 6 per cent. The South has grown at a slightly higher 
rate than the national average. 29

Restructuring the production system
These achievements were supported by expansionary economic 
measures, but would not have been possible without the restructuring of 
the production system that followed the sovereign debt crisis. 30 
Between 2013 and 2023, labour productivity in the private sector 
grew by 0.7 per cent a year on average, and total factor productivity rose 
by more than 1 per cent, marking a clear improvement compared to the 
period 2000-13. 31
The number of workers employed in medium-sized and large firms 
has grown significantly and the number of companies with at least 250 
employees has risen by one third. 32 The adoption of advanced technologies, 
such as cloud computing, robotics and artificial intelligence, has spread 
(Figure 7.a). 33 Over time, profitability and capital positions have strongly 
improved (Figure 7.b).
This response by the production system to global changes offers a 
beacon of hope, but it is just a first step.

Recent developments and manufacturing
GDP grew by 0.7 per cent in 2024, accompanied by particularly 
favourable employment conditions. However, labour productivity declined, 
and so did goods exports. 
There was modest growth in domestic demand, with households 
remaining cautious and limiting the expansion in consumption to 0.4 per 
cent, in spite of a 1.3 per cent increase in disposable income.
Value added in manufacturing fell by 0.7 per cent, partly as an effect 
of growing international competition. The remainder of the private sector 
instead grew by 1 per cent.
In spite of the present challenges, Italian industry is not headed for decline. 
Dynamic and competitive firms operate in all economic sectors, invest in 
technology and research, and rank high in their field of production. Having 
such solid foundations provides a strategic advantage in global competition, 
but they need strengthening.
Firms need to continue along the path of innovation and investment 
supported by public policies that enable them to manage the current 
transformations successfully.
In Italy more than elsewhere in Europe, it is a priority to address energy 
costs,34 persevering with the course of action already undertaken: making 
greater use of clean energy sources, incentivizing the use of long-term 
contracts and strengthening infrastructure and transmission networks. 35 
Adequate investment and much simpler authorization procedures for new 
plants are needed.
Yet the central issue is always productivity – in manufacturing as in the rest of 
the economy. There has been encouraging productivity growth, though it is not 
enough to support development in Italy.
Low salary levels are a reflection of this weakness. Since the start of the 
century, mirroring the stagnation in productivity, real wages have grown far less 
than in the other major European countries: up to the pandemic, wages had 
grown by a mere 6 per cent. The subsequent inflationary shock drove real wages 
back to below the 2000 levels, despite the recovery that began last year.
Nevertheless, to ensure a lasting increase in wages, it is essential to boost 
productivity and growth through innovation, capital accumulation and forceful 
public action.

Innovation as a strategic lever
Innovation must be at the heart of our economic strategy. This requires 
far more investment in research and development, in order to bridge the 
gap that divides Italy from Europe and the United States (Figure 8). 
The biggest effort here must come from the private sector, whose 
spending on research and development remains low, a shortcoming that is 
only partly explained by the prevalence of traditional sectors.
Public action can support innovation by stimulating private research and 
investment in technology. Public incentives have yielded positive results in 
the last few years, albeit at a high cost.36 They can become more effective and 
less costly if they are more targeted and if procedures are simplified.
The quality of scientific research has equalled – and in some sectors 
overtaken – that of the major European countries, especially in medicine, 
engineering and IT .37 However, the number of patents remains low, equal 
to one fifth of German patents and to half of those of France, and they are 
concentrated in mature sectors. T echnology transfer capacity is also still 
unsatisfactory.38 
These failings are mainly a question of resources: average university 
spending stands at 1.3 per cent of GDP in Europe, but at only 1 per cent 
in Italy. Closing this gap would be a farsighted investment, achievable with 
relatively limited resources.

Increasing funds to improve centres of excellence would make the 
university system more attractive to Italian and foreign researchers, who are 
currently choosing institutions abroad. Targeted policies for attracting talent 
could also catch scholars who are leaving other countries.
The National Recovery and Resilience Plan
Public action can support capital accumulation by investing in 
infrastructure and creating a business-friendly environment. This is the 
guiding principle behind the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). 
Italy has received €122 billion under the Plan so far and has used over 
half of that.39 The disbursement of the upcoming instalments will depend on 
reaching targets linked to the completion of public works. The information 
currently available suggests that there are delays.40 
The use of NRRP funds has supported the economy in recent years. The 
measures scheduled over the years 2025-26 could increase GDP by 0.5 per 
cent: at a time of cyclical weakness, it is essential to be resolute in moving 
forward with their implementation.
As regards reforms, measures to liberalize markets and simplify 
administrative procedures have strengthened the economic fabric over the 
last fifteen years. 41 The institutional landscape has improved. The length 
of trials on contractual issues is down by one third, in part thanks to the 
organizational reforms to civil justice. Also, the NRRP has promoted the 
digitalization of the public administration, making public services more 
accessible and procurement procedures for public works more efficient and 
transparent.42
Reform efforts require time and continuity, and must continue 
beyond the end of the NRRP . The priorities remain those set out in the  
fiscal-structural plan for the next five years: 43 improving the business 
environment and reforming the public administration and the justice and 
tax systems.
Demographics and the labour force
The ageing of the population and the low birth rate are bound to have 
a profound effect on the growth potential of Italy’s economy. According to 
Istat, the number of working age people will drop by five million by 2040.44 
This could mean an 11 per cent contraction in GDP , an 8 per cent fall in per 
capita terms.45 

BANCA D’ITALIA The Governor’s Concluding Remarks
21
Annual Report 2024
An increase in labour market participation rates would soften this effect.46 
Greater inclusion of women could help significantly; despite recent progress, 
their participation rate is among the lowest in Europe.47 Investments in childcare 
services encourage female employment, which is still hindered by a lack of 
adequate facilities and an unbalanced distribution of family responsibilities.
However, even under the most favourable scenario, higher participation 
rates will at best offset the fall in the working-age population. 
In order to expand the labour force in a stable way, attractive employment 
opportunities need to be created for the many Italians who leave the country in 
search of better prospects. Some 700,000 Italians have emigrated in the last ten 
years, a fifth of whom are young graduates.48
Legal immigration can make a significant contribution, especially in the 
construction and tourism sectors, which are experiencing a growing shortage 
of labour.49 
This contribution could extend to higher value-added activities, 
provided that skilled workers can be attracted. 50 Italy lags behind on this 
front: among the leading countries, it has the lowest share of immigrant 
graduates (Figure 9). Narrowing this gap entails – among other things –  
aligning the system for recognizing academic degrees and professional 
qualifications in line with European standards.

The public finances
Compared with 15 years ago, when the assessments of the main rating 
agencies on Italy’s public debt began to worsen, the fundamentals of our economy 
have greatly improved. 
The net international investment position, which was negative by 20 
percentage points of GDP , is positive by 15 points today. The banking system 
is significantly more robust, which has a significant impact on agencies’ ratings. 
The resolution of the pandemic and energy crises has made it possible to end 
the phase of extraordinary budget measures, thus improving the public accounts. 
The deficit fell to 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2024 and a primary surplus was recorded 
for the first time since 2019. 
This progress was reflected in the positive assessments recently published by 
rating agencies. 
However, the process of fiscal consolidation is only at the beginning. Debt 
remains high and expenditure will come under pressure in the next few years 
owing to an ageing population, the green and digital transitions, and the scaling 
up of our defence capacity. 
The new European rules have restored a medium-term horizon to fiscal 
policy, thereby helping to anchor investors’ expectations. The medium-term 
fiscal-structural plan, published last autumn, sets out a path for debt reduction in 
line with this new approach. The public finance document for 2025, approved in 
April, confirmed that we are heading in that direction. 
It is crucial to ensure continuity along this path, even in the event of a 
weakening macroeconomic outlook. The progress achieved in recent years must 
prompt us to maintain a prudent fiscal policy and to intensify the reform efforts 
needed to support growth. 
Economic growth and the sustainability of the public finances are 
interdependent. Confidence in the soundness of public finances encourages 
investment, and higher growth in turn makes fiscal consolidation less of a burden.
Banks and financial markets 
The Italian banking system
Balance sheet data and market valuations confirm that the Italian banking 
system is on solid footing. 
The cost-to-income ratio continues to improve. Net interest income is 
starting to be negatively affected by falling interest rates, but profitability is

being supported by fee income, especially on asset management activities. 
Return on equity remains high and the outlook is stable. 
Small banks, which are more vulnerable to the squeeze on net interest 
income, nevertheless enjoy a relatively satisfactory return on equity of around 
8 per cent. 51
Capitalization is robust for the system as a whole and exceeds the 
European average. The price-to-book ratio for listed banks remains well above 
one (Figure 10).
According to our estimates, the flow of non-performing loans to firms 
will continue to grow moderately over the next two years. T rade tensions 
could affect credit risk, but the impact should be limited overall. 52 In any 
case, high profitability and the built-up capital buffers have prepared the 
Italian banking system to absorb possible shocks. 
Banca d’Italia continues to monitor the situation closely and stands 
ready to take action where needed. Over the last few months, the Bank 
has intervened in several cases in which small banks found themselves in 
difficulty, mainly owing to corporate governance and internal control system 
deficiencies.
Trends in lending
Over the last year, lending to firms continued to decline, albeit at a slower 
pace. This development warrants attention: adequate availability of credit is

essential to support investment and revive production – especially for small 
firms, who find it more difficult to access alternative funding sources.
The available evidence suggests, however, that the contraction in lending 
to firms primarily reflects weak demand, rather than a tightening of credit 
supply conditions. 
Business surveys show that the share of firms that report difficulties in 
accessing credit is declining across all sectors and all size classes. 
This finding is consistent with firms’ balance sheet data. In recent years, 
internal financing has grown more than investment (Figure 11.a), including 
for small firms, thereby progressively reducing – and eventually eliminating – 
the need for external funding (Figure 11.b).  
At the same time, many firms have substantially increased their capital53 
and expanded their reserves of financial assets. As I have already mentioned, 
leverage has improved considerably since the sovereign debt crisis. 
Banca d’Italia will continue to follow developments in lending, especially 
in the case of small firms.

Consolidations
In recent months, several complex consolidation transactions have been 
announced, sometimes in competition with one another, that involve banks of 
different sizes and business models, insurance companies and asset managers.
For some of these transactions, the investigation phase has ended, while 
for others it is still under way.
Three years of robust profits have made significant resources available 
to banks, which are now being used to launch initiatives that would reduce 
the fragmentation of the Italian credit market, thereby bringing its degree of 
concentration closer to that of the other main European countries.
Acquisitions can be a delicate moment and mark a break in the life of 
intermediaries. Their goal must be to strengthen them, which is why they 
must be well-designed and aimed solely at value creation.
Creating value means, first and foremost, offering firms and households 
adequate financing in terms of quantity and costs; effective and transparent 
savings instruments at fair conditions; qualified and innovative services, 
consistent with Italy’s development needs.
As part of its mandate, Banca d’Italia is involved in the transaction 
approval processes in close cooperation with the ECB and IVASS. Other 
national and foreign authorities operate in accordance with their statutory 
powers.
Banca d’Italia is responsible for verifying that each transaction complies 
with Italian and EU prudential legislation, and that the resulting intermediaries 
are sound in terms of capital, liquidity and risk governance.
Provided these conditions are met, the judgment on each offer is 
ultimately determined by market dynamics and shareholder decisions.
Simplifying the regulatory framework
The newly-elected US administration has taken a favourable stance 
towards the deregulation of the banking and financial sectors. This also raises 
questions for the European Union, which needs to consider whether and how 
to respond so as not to be placed at a competitive disadvantage. 
There are good reasons why Europe should not go down the same path. 
Weakening the regulatory framework in an environment of increasing 
risks would be imprudent. Maintaining an effective regulatory framework 
that staves off instability and preserves the soundness of the system is crucial.

BANCA D’ITALIAThe Governor’s Concluding Remarks
Annual Report 2024
26
The rules introduced in response to the global financial crisis have proved 
effective. They have helped European banks withstand major shocks – from 
the pandemic to the energy crisis – while remaining strong. Conversely, 
the failure of a few US regional banks in the spring of 2023 can be partly 
explained by the non-application of some international prudential standards.
Moreover, European banks have been showing highly positive capital and 
income results for years, proof that well-designed regulations can safeguard 
stability without sacrificing competitiveness and efficiency.
The aim must therefore not be to relax the rules but rather to improve 
them.
The focus should be on simplification, thereby eliminating regulatory 
overlaps and ambiguities and lightening the administrative burden.54 A clearer 
and more consistent regulatory framework would reduce uncertainty for 
operators and make supervisory action more effective and timely.
In Europe, simplification must start by harmonizing the legislation across 
EU Member States, so that operators active in multiple markets do not have 
to comply with different rules. In the banking sector, the goal must be to have 
a coherent EU legislative framework based on a consolidated banking law for 
all the Member States.
Intervention should help achieve the objectives of the regulations, 
preserving the levels of capital and liquidity achieved so far. It should cover all 
regulatory levels55 and the main scopes of application: from macroprudential 
oversight and the supervision of financial intermediaries, to crisis management 
and resolution. 
Simplification is one of the European Commission’s priorities for this 
legislative term and is part of its strategy to boost the EU’s competitiveness.56
The initiatives recently announced by the Commission 57 to develop 
securitizations, facilitate the cross-border activity of investment funds and 
boost investment in venture capital go in the right direction and can foster 
the creation of a genuine European capital market. 
Banca d’Italia is involved in the discussions on these issues within the 
Eurosystem and in cooperation with the Ministry of Economy and Finance 
and the European Commission. 
Crypto-assets
The link between the world of crypto-assets and the financial system 
are growing ever stronger at international level. Agreements between 

BANCA D’ITALIA The Governor’s Concluding Remarks
27
Annual Report 2024
crypto-asset players and financial intermediaries are on the rise, and so are 
initiatives launched by the latter. Some US listed companies have purchased 
large amounts of Bitcoin, thereby exposing their shares – and indirectly 
savers – to the volatility of this instrument. Furthermore, exchange traded 
funds (ETFs) that invest in Bitcoin have been operating for some time.
These developments have implications for risk.
First, crypto-assets such as Bitcoin, which are not backed by an 
underlying asset, are highly volatile and are mostly traded on unregulated, 
opaque exchanges. Their growing interconnectedness with the financial 
system makes it more difficult to contain the related risks, as I have already 
discussed on previous occasions. 58 
Second, there is the matter of stablecoins. These instruments are 
designed to maintain a stable value against underlying currencies or assets, 
but still expose holders to risks relating to the soundness of the issuers and 
to volatility in the value of the underlying asset. In the absence of adequate 
regulation, their suitability as a means of payment is doubtful, to say the 
least. 
However, if large foreign-based technology platforms decided to 
promote the use of stablecoins for payments between their customers, this 
could lead to new systemically important payment schemes operating on 
a global scale. Traditional means of payment used domestically – such as 
banknotes and cards – could be crowded out, negatively affecting monetary 
sovereignty, personal data protection, and credit intermediation, which so 
far has always been integrated with and complementary to the provision of 
payment services. 
One risk that cuts across all crypto-assets is that of illicit use. As these 
technologies allow anonymous transactions, they lend themselves to being 
used for activities such as money laundering, arms or drug trafficking and 
the circumvention of international sanctions. 59
Several countries have started regulating crypto-assets. China decided 
to ban their use. Conversely, the US administration has taken a favourable 
stance, though the regulatory framework is still a work in progress. 60 
In Europe, the Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MiCAR) 
introduced rules to protect customers and facilitate the orderly development 
of the market. 61 MiCAR divides stablecoins into two categories: only 
those pegged to a single currency – known as electronic money tokens  
(EMTs) – offer consumers sufficient safeguards to qualify as a means of 
payment, including the right to redeem them at nominal value.

BANCA D’ITALIAThe Governor’s Concluding Remarks
Annual Report 2024
28
Since MiCAR came into force, only some EMT stablecoins have been 
issued in the EU and their circulation is limited so far. Many operators 
reported they had started providing crypto-asset services, or were intending 
to apply for authorization to do so.
In Italy, there has so far been little interest in the issuance of  
crypto-assets by supervised intermediaries and other operators, while a 
growing focus on custodial and trading services has been observed. 
The risks that stem from this sector will have to be monitored carefully, 
especially the reputational risks linked to the provision of crypto-assets 
by banks. In fact, there is a concern that crypto-asset holders might not 
fully understand their nature and conflate them with traditional banking 
products, with potentially negative repercussions for confidence in the 
credit system should losses occur.
Overall, MiCAR offers protection to European savers. However, 
heterogeneity in regulatory approaches at international level remains 
a source of risk. EU citizens might be exposed to failures of platforms 
or issuers based in other jurisdictions that lack adequate controls or the 
necessary transparency and operational safeguards.
These risks can be contained through international cooperation – an 
objective for which Europe could take the lead. 
But we would be remiss to think that the evolution of crypto-assets 
can be controlled only through rules and restrictions. 
What is needed is a response that matches the ongoing technological 
transformation, one capable of meeting the demand for secure, efficient 
and accessible digital payment instruments, all while preserving the role 
of central bank money. The digital euro project stems precisely from this 
need.
At the same time, strengthening financial literacy is essential to help 
people navigate the new digital landscape and make informed decisions 
about the opportunities and risks that come with these products and 
services.
Banca d’Italia is engaged on both of these fronts.

Conclusions
New countries have emerged on the global stage, propelled by market 
integration throughout the long period of economic stability following the 
end of the Cold War. 
In 2000, G7 economies accounted for almost half of the world’s GDP; 
today, they generate less than one third. T echnology is no longer the exclusive 
domain of advanced countries. 
The importance gained by the emerging economies was bound to shift 
the existing balance. 
Globalization has driven world growth and lifted more than two billion 
people out of poverty, but not everyone has benefited fully. What has followed 
is a widespread sense of disenchantment, heightened by a dramatic sequence 
of crises over the last two decades. 
T oday’s bitter trade disputes are not a passing malaise. They are symptoms 
of a fraying of international political and economic relations, which has 
accelerated the reorganization of global supply chains and of trade flows that 
was already under way. 
Digital innovation is unfolding before our very eyes. It can and should 
become a driving force for productivity again, which otherwise risks stagnating 
in advanced countries. We must not fear it. 
Yet, like any technological revolution, the one we are currently 
experiencing will reshape our economies. It will only be sustainable if we can 
benefit from it by making it inclusive, mitigating its risks and protecting the 
weak.   
The repercussions of these developments on the global economy are 
difficult to foresee. Even the role of the dollar, long the linchpin of the 
international monetary system, is now being questioned. Uncertainty is 
widespread. 
The multilateral system – unbalanced and imperfect as it was – sought to 
address global challenges through shared rules and common principles. That 
system is now in crisis. In its place, a multipolar order is taking shape, one in 
which power dynamics carry increasing weight. 
Even the historically close relationship between the US and Europe is 
feeling the strain. Yet the cultural affinities and economic ties that unite us 
must ultimately prevail over the current frictions. 
We must get ready to navigate these uncertain waters, without giving up 
our values, and without falling behind.

The European Union remains a bastion for the rule of law, democratic 
coexistence and openness to trade and international cooperation, but it 
cannot afford to stand still. It must rise above national divisions and convert 
its economic strength – and its rich heritage of culture and values – into 
political clout. 
I have often argued that a common European response is key to 
overcoming today’s challenges. The agenda is well-known, and the path is 
already mapped out. 
There is now an unavoidable need, but also a real possibility, to complete 
the common market; to simplify, but not dismantle, the rules that govern 
it; and to create a unified capital market centred on the regular issuance of 
European bonds. This would help generate the public and private resources 
needed to finance investment and foster growth. 
It is just as important to preserve and strengthen the pillars of the 
European social model. Our social welfare systems, based on the principle of 
solidarity, are preconditions for development and cornerstones of European 
civil society. 
Italy will also benefit from a decisive common European response. 
The challenges of growth and innovation now facing Europe emerged 
earlier – and more markedly – in Italy. We bear the burden of longstanding 
structural weaknesses that we have not yet overcome: regional disparities, 
low education levels, a fragmented production system, and persistent 
barriers to innovation. For forty years now, we have shouldered a heavy 
public debt that restricts our investment capacity and constrains economic 
policies. 
Yet, in the aftermath of the global financial and sovereign debt crises, 
we are seeing signs of change: in manufacturing and services, in the financial 
sector, in the public administration and in research. These are signs of vitality 
that we must not fritter away. 
These achievements are unfinished, but they mark real progress. They 
provide a concrete foundation on which to build – through reforms, by 
dismantling entrenched privileges, and by giving young people a future they 
can believe in.
We have both the responsibility and the opportunity to do this.
