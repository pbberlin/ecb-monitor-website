Dear Vice-Minister of Finance, distinguished guests, dear colleagues,
Before I begin, let me express my sincere gratitude to the Center of Excellence in Anti-
Money Laundering for hosting us today. Thank you. In just a few short years, this 
gathering has become a vital space for reflection on where we stand today and where 
we are headed. 
Time and again in our previous gatherings, we went beyond the surface of illicit finance. 
And discussed about the importance of cooperation to address money laundering risks.
This year we are going even further beyond the surface. Because true motivation stems 
from fully understanding the mission.
A – M – L. We all know what these letters stand for. Today, I would like to invite you to 
uncover additional layers of meaning. As three qualities that define an effective and 
principled response to financial crime.  
A is adequacy. M is mobilisation. And, leadership. 
Or AML, in short. 
Let me now unlock these qualities. 
First, on adequacy. I will repeat what I emphasized on our previous gatherings, 
standing exactly at this tribune: Lietuvos bankas is loving and therefore, strict 
supervisor. Adequacy and a risk-balanced approach was. And remains. The essence of 
our supervisory strategy to fight illicit financing.
Money laundering risk management does not mean de-risking. The focus on the 
consumer – in terms of accessibility, quality and safety of financial services – has to 
remain at the heart of business for each and every financial institution. True AML 
effectiveness lies not in narrowing access. But in strengthening vigilance of both rules 
and the common sense. In truly knowing your customer. Not rejecting them 
preemptively.
Of course, our job is to think about risks. And to be attentive to them. 
The risk of fraud remains relevant. Financial institutions have to implement adequate 
controls to identify and prevent fraud cases.

Mobilisation. Of an international as well national effort. That is the second point I want 
to make. 
Previous year. For the first time. EU level regulation harmonising anti-money laundering 
rules were adopted. You, as community of AML professionals, are well aware that 
criminal activities go beyond states' borders. So, it is very important to have clear 
framework aimed at eliminating regulatory arbitrage.
To coordinate the enforcement of EU level regulation, a new European Authority is set 
up. AMLA. 
I believe AMLA could be a game-changer. Because it offers a unique opportunity to 
eliminate the fragmentation of AML oversight and enforcement across the EU and 
effectively address illicit cross border financial flows.
A push toward European approach doesn't mean local authorities are getting less 
important. To the contrary. AMLA opens up the path for nationally-grown skills and 
competences to be transmitted to the EU level. 
I want to say that for AMLA to be impactful, cooperation is key. The agency must be 
rooted in strong, operational partnerships with those who understand the national 
context and risks best.
These people are YOU. 
The 3rd national money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment completed 
last year was an important milestone. It deepened the knowledge of nationally faced 
risks. The assessment was very important for financial sector to identify both their own 
risks and those of their partners/clients.
To understand and prevent the risks we need to work in common. Using this 
opportunity, I would like to thank the State Tax Inspectorate, Financial Crimes 
Investigation Service, vigilant markets participants, Lithuanian Police, my colleagues at 
Lietuvos bankas, Center of Excellence in Anti-Money Laundering. You are an essential 
part of unified effort to stand firm against illegal activities. 
Dear colleagues,
Leadership is the third quality that defines an effective and principled response to 
financial crime. 
Leadership is not defined by title. Rank. Or position. The leader is an analyst who 
carefully reviews suspicious transactions. The leader is a compliance officer who 
challenges inconsistencies. 
Leadership lives in the choices we make when no one is watching. In the consistency, 
integrity, and devotion with which we perform our duties. 
True leadership is not defined by what you do. But by how. 

3/3 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
But how to make the leadership continuous? How to find motivation in everyday 
routine? When daily tasks are often repetitive. And even good results not always come 
with applause. 
I invite you to unlock the power of motivation from the very essence of the work that you 
do. Because it is both distinct and special. 
In most areas of finance, professionals are tasked with managing credit, liquidity or 
market risk. Measuring it. Pricing it. Deciding what level of exposure is acceptable. 
The risk that YOU face is fundamentally different. It cannot be priced. It cannot be 
accepted. It must be fought – relentlessly. 
Because it is not just a risk to financial integrity. Money laundering is a threat to justice 
and to security. Your job is not about constructing a financial portfolio which minimizes 
expected credit loss. 
You are protectors of financial system. You are generators of trust. Ultimately, you are 
guardians of the values our society lives by. 
This is not an easy task. So, let that responsibility be a key. That you use to unlock the 
gate leading to everyday motivation. 
I will stop here wishing you insightful conference.
