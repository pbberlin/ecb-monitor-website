1/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Olaf Sleijpen: Central counterparties - central to protecting financial 
stability
Speech by Mr Olaf Sleijpen, Executive Board Member of Monetary Affairs and Financial 
Stability of De Nederlandsche Bank, , at the annual meeting of central counterparties
Amsterdam, 19 June 2025.
* * *
It's a real pleasure to be here with you today-and not just anywhere, but in a place 
steeped in history. This magnificent building once housed the Admiralty of Amsterdam. 
Back in the 17th century, during the Dutch Republic, this was the nerve centre for naval 
protection-not just for this city, but for much of the country.
And how fitting it is that we gather here today for the annual meeting of CCP Global. 
Because, in your own way, you too are protectors. You safeguard the financial system. 
You stand as a buffer against instability. You ensure that financial services continue to 
flow-to businesses, to households, to society.
Your work matters. Deeply. And CCP Global plays a vital role in strengthening the 
resilience of CCPs around the world. So let me start by saying: thank you. Thank you 
for the work you do. And thank you for inviting me to be part of this important 
conversation between CCPs, central banks, and regulators.
When I joined the board of the Dutch central bank in 2020, I took on responsibility for 
Monetary Affairs, including Payments and Market Infrastructures. I had some familiarity 
with central clearing from my time overseeing pension fund supervision. And our paths 
crossed when I was working in the pension industry myself. But I'll admit-this world was 
still somewhat new to me.
What I did remember vividly, though, was the chaos of the 2008 financial crisis. Amid 
the turmoil of Lehman Brothers' collapse, the CCPs remained strongholds of stability 
and trust. And that made one thing very clear-central clearing is a cornerstone of 
financial stability.
But with great importance comes great scrutiny. Governments and regulators said: 
'Thank you, CCPs. You know what? You are so important, you deserve more 
supervision.' And so, the spotlight turned to you-not just from central banks, but from 
market supervisors as well.
Enter CPMI-IOSCO, arguably the longest acronym in the world of financial regulation. 
For those who need a refresher: it's a collaboration between the BIS Committee on 
Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of 
Securities Commissions (IOSCO). A marriage between central banks and market 
regulators. I had the honour of co-chairing the Policy Standing Group from 2022 until 
recently, and I now co-chair the Steering Group.

2/4 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, launched in 2012, are one of our 
proudest achievements. Since then, we've worked to keep those principles relevant-by 
developing guidance and by applying them to new challenges and emerging risks.
Let me name a few of those challenges.
First: margining. The COVID-19 pandemic brought a 'dash for cash' that tested our 
systems. Margining, while essential for safety, also created liquidity strains. Initial 
margin spikes and variation margin hiccups caused serious challenges for market 
participants. Central banks had to step in to avert a crisis. It was a wake-up call. We 
needed better regulation, better practices.
Afterwards, policymakers and industry leaders came together to set standards for how 
margining could better contribute to safer and more stable markets. The community 
found that initial margining should most prominently be anti-cyclical. We formulated 
recommendations to that end and CCPs went on to implement them. The importance of 
strengthening margining was confirmed during the volatility following Russia's attack on 
Ukraine and during the turmoil in the UK gilt market. Without proper liquidity 
management in the form of margining, these events would have caused much more 
financial instability.
I think the work on margining is a great example of how the standard setting bodies and 
the sector, working together, can achieve great things. And now we have to finish what 
we started, notably implementing it in local regulation and in CCP practices. So to all of 
you I would say: continue the work on margining.
Second: non-default losses. We've made great strides in managing default risk and 
related losses. But what about cyber risk? Legal risk? Climate risk? These can also 
threaten CCPs and cause losses.
The risk of cyberattacks is particularly urgent. Market infrastructures occupy a unique 
position in the cyberthreat landscape. You may be targeted less often than banks-but if 
you are hit, the consequences could be enormous. That's because your systems are 
critical. And your numbers are few. If party A goes down, it can be difficult for party B to 
compensate. These features make CCPs an attractive target, in particular for nation-
state actors who want to cause maximum disruption.
So CCPs need to stay alert to cyber risk, including managing possible losses if these 
risks materialise. At CPMI-IOSCO, we have been thinking hard about how CCPs should 
address non-default losses, keeping in place plans for recovery and orderly wind-down, 
and balance sheet capacity. We will share our findings with you soon.
Third: resolution. One of the deliverables of the last three years was the FSB report on 
instruments and resources in CCP resolution, that came about with the help of the 
industry and CPMI-IOSCO. Having the proper toolbox for CCP resolution is important, 
not only for the trust in CCPs, but also for providing clarity to clearing members and 
other stakeholders on what they can expect in crisis situations. It is now up to national 
regulators and the CCPs to implement the recommendations in this report.

So margining, non-default losses, resolution, this is all work in progress. What else do 
we see? As our work programme says: 'CPMI-IOSCO will continue its horizon scanning 
for emerging issues in FMI risk management'. I'd say, we should also take a look at 
what's right on our doorstep. I would call them the three 'ations' (with a letter t): 
digitalisation, non-bank financial intermediation and geo-economic fragmentation.
It may not surprise you that digitalisation brings opportunities and risks for CCPs. I 
already mentioned cyber risk. But what is the impact of Distributed Ledger Technology 
on clearing and settlement? Will there be an uptake of tokenised securities, derivatives, 
stablecoins? And what does digitalisation mean for trading, clearing and settlement? In 
the world that we know, trading takes place on a trading venue or over the counter, 
clearing at a CCP and settlement at a CSD. Will tokenisation change this? And if there 
is a mixture of roles, how will CCPs deal with this? How do we keep the right 
governance in place?
Then non-bank financial intermediairies, or NBFI. The NBFI sector has grown into a 
critical part of the financial system. It brings real benefits. NBFI offer a diversified source 
of funding. But they also carry vulnerabilities-liquidity mismatches, leverage, and 
inadequate margin preparedness.
The FSB has done a lot of work to make this part of the financial system more safe. 
Notably, it has put forward policy recommendations to enhance money market fund 
resilience, to address structural liquidity mismatch in open-ended funds, and to enhance 
margin practices. Recommendations which now have to be implemented by national 
jurisdictions.
But more recently we have also seen the growing importance of stablecoin issuers, 
payment service providers of all kinds, etcetera. What is the impact on CCPs? Can 
CCPs also mitigate risks caused by these new developments, for example by offering 
cleared repo? These are questions that both the industry and regulators will have to 
address.
I would like to end with some remarks on our work in the context of the current 
geopolitical climate. Global cooperation is harder in a fragmented world. But it is also 
more essential. Not only because our work almost by definition crosses borders. But 
also because geo-economic fragmentation, brings about new types of risk. Think of 
cyber risk, and the risk of strategic dependencies. In a world that is becoming more 
dangerous, a lack of international cooperation is an accident waiting to happen.
So how do we limit the impact of political fragmentation on the global standard setting 
community? It is important that, apart from continuing to do our jobs, we  stay 
committed to international cooperation and the institutions that support it, like the FSB 
and CPMI-IOSCO.
And I also look at you. CCP's are almost by nature global institutions that thrive on 
global cooperation and multilateralism. The more the industry can do by itself in order to 
improve the robustness and transparency of its activities, the better. So I would 
encourage CCP Global to continue its initiatives to strengthen CCP resilience: by

developing best practices among yourselves, by continuing to organise the global drills, 
by ensuring higher transparency around margins, and by improving the quality and 
frequency of the Public Quantitative Disclosure.
Compared to some other parts of the financial industry, the cooperation between CCPs, 
central banks and regulators is very constructive. I believe that's because we all think 
like risk managers. For you, safety and trust are your business model. For us central 
banks, it is our mission.
So let's treasure that cooperation. Let's nurture it, through meetings like this one, here 
in the former Admiralty of Amsterdam. Let's protect the world of clearing. Let's keep it 
safe, stable, and strong.
Thank you.
