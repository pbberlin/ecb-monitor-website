1 Introduction: recognising the signs of the times
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Europe's sovereignty is currently being challenged by various angles, such as 
enhancing defence capabilities. It would also appear advisable for Europe to become 
more economically independent. For instance, we depend on non-European providers 
for payments and many digital services. TheEU Member States need to work together    
more closely and also step up cooperation with willing third countries. After all, it is 
important for us to represent our common values and interests as best as we can.
But it is not just European sovereignty that is being challenged. Doubts have also arisen 
on the other side the Atlantic regarding the safe-haven status of theUS dollar.    
Immediately after theUS tariff announcements at the beginning of April, exchange rate    
movements were atypical for periods of heightened uncertainty in the financial markets. 
The US dollar did not benefit from its status as a safe haven, but depreciated instead. It    
seems possible that international investors' loss in confidence will persist.
This certainly does not signal the end of the US  dollar as the world's leading currency, 
but Europe should recognise the signs of the times. Despite the adverse circumstances, 
we are called upon to do whatever is necessary to ensure that Europe and the euro 
continue to play an important role on the world stage in the future. I'd like to explain this 
in more detail in three steps, starting with the question of what we mean by a strong 
euro.
2 A strong euro–what does that mean?
Above all, strength means stability. A currency's purchasing power should remain 
stable over time in order to maintain price stability. Price stability ensures stable 
economic conditions that make long-term planning possible. In this vein, you, in your 
group of managers, are connected to us on theECB Governing Council: if we do our    
job well–in other words fulfil our mandate–you are better able to fulfil your tasks, for 
instance when making business investment decisions.
A strong and stable currency also requires stability-oriented fiscal policy and overall 
predictable policies. Military clout is also necessary to ensure external security if the 
worst comes to the worst. Other key conditions for the strength or international 
importance of a currency are deep, liquid and open capital markets as well as a wide 
range of high-quality safe assets.

2/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The euro is currently the second most important currency in the world. Its share across 
various indicators of international currency use stood at around 19% in 2024.This was 1 
largely unchanged from previous years. The gap to theUS dollar is large, but so is the    
advantage over other currencies.
Recent exchange rate developments have led to economic policy debates.The euro 2 
has appreciated by 12.5% against theUS dollar since the beginning of the year. This    
raised concerns in some cases that the euro-USdollar exchange rate had reached a  
level that was placing an excessive strain on the euro area export industry.
However, it is more meaningful to look at how the euro has developed against the 
currencies of several trading partners. Its effective appreciation in the year to date came 
to only 5.7% against a group of 18 partner currencies. This figure was 6.2% against a 
group of 41 partner currencies. Simply analysing the euro's gains against theUS dollar    
thus overstates how much the German export industry is being burdened.
Nevertheless, revised data indicate that the price competitiveness of both Germany and 
the euro area has deteriorated in recent years.According to Bundesbank calculations, 3 
the recent appreciation of the euro has contributed to the price competitiveness of the 
German economy and the euro area no longer being favourable, but rather neutral. 
Overall, I am not concerned about the euro's current valuation level.
The depreciation of theUS dollar this year can be attributed to various factors. Most    
recently, differences in interest rate developments on both sides of the Atlantic played a 
role in particular, influenced by the expected course of monetary policy in the two 
economic areas.
As mentioned earlier, the first signs of a loss in confidence in theUS currency caused    
by political factors emerged after the day President Trump dubbed "Liberation Day" in 
April. In addition, the tax and fiscal package, the , has led to growing Big Beautiful Bill
fears aboutUS debt sustainability. Increasing concerns about the independence of the     
US central bank has also harmed confidence in the dollar. It appears that it is no longer  
seen unreservedly as a safe haven.
However, it is neither on the cards nor desirable for theUS dollar to be replaced as the    
world's leading currency. Nevertheless, there are tendencies towards greater 
diversification of foreign reserve assets. In this respect, the question of greater global 
importance of the euro is perfectly justified. In my view, a stronger international role for 
our single currency would be desirable.
This is because, not least, it promises funding cost advantages for Member States and 
enterprises. However, of course this would not change the fact that favourable financing 
conditions also require stability-oriented fiscal policy. Sound fiscal policy pursued by 
euro area countries tends to result in there being more high-quality and safe 
government bonds in the euro area. That is likely to support the international role of the 
euro.
3 Strengthening Europe's sovereignty

3/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
Let us now turn to step two: promoting European sovereignty. Needless to say, 
geopolitical changes have injected new urgency into this topic. Protectionist tendencies 
were already evident before the newUS administration made its drastic pivot in trade    
policy.
In an increasingly fragmented world, it is especially important for Europe to make the 
best possible use of its single market's potential. Strikingly, estimates by the 
International Monetary Fund have shown that trade barriers within the European Union 
in 2020 were equivalent to tariffs of 44% for industrial products and as high as 110% in 
the case of services.There are still considerable barriers to be removed.4 
Moreover, greater integration of European financial markets would be a huge 
opportunity and highly welcome.I have already made the case for this on numerous 5 
occasions.6
European households' high level of savings should be better channelled towards more 
innovation, productivity and competitiveness.Our savings are urgently needed to 7 
finance the green and digital transitions in Europe, as well as defence spending.
The Savings and Investments Union would simplify cross-border investment and enable 
a more efficient use of funds. The cost of capital is likely to decline in the case of a 
larger and more diverse supply of capital. Thus, financially stronger integration in 
Europe could also close gaps if funding sources dry up due to geo-economic 
fragmentation. Moreover, a better distribution of risks across borders would be possible, 
making the European economy more resilient to shocks.All in all, progress in the 8 
Savings and Investments Union is expected to significantly increase Europe's economic 
strength and attractiveness.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is not just the new geopolitical environment that supports 
strengthening European sovereignty. In addition, there is a second reason that could 
potentially create new realities: stablecoins. A lot of fuss about nothing; we shouldn't get 
–you might be thinking this or something along these unnecessary worked up about this
lines. For me, it is important to contextualise current developments and prospects in a 
rational way.
Stablecoins are digital tokens issued by private issuers, which aim for value stability. 
Their value is therefore tied to assets. In practice, these are currently often assets 
denominated inUS dollars such as government bonds or bank deposits. Stablecoins    
have thus far played a limited role, but their market is growing. This is because they 
offer something that does not exist like this elsewhere, such as programmable 
payments for non-banks, meaning that delivery-versus-payment transactions can be 
carried out immediately and automatically.
In July,US President Donald Trump signed the "GENIUS Act". This regulatory    
framework is intended to further expand the dominance of theUS dollar through    
stablecoins. As the regulation requires every stablecoin to be fully backed and the 
backing can be in the form of short-termUS Treasuries, the GENIUS Act supports    
demand for short-termUS Treasuries.   

4/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
The Bank for International Settlementstook a close look at stablecoins in its latest  (BIS) 
Annual Economic Report.To quote theBIS directly, 9      Stablecoins as a form of sound 
money fall short, and without regulation pose a risk to financial stability and monetary 
."sovereignty10
In my view, stablecoins do indeed carry risks. A loss of confidence could lead to 
redemptions of stablecoins on a massive scale and fire sales of reserve assets–with 
spillover effects on money and bond markets. And yes, such crypto-assets should not 
be allowed to spread in an uncontrolled manner. In Europe, the Markets in Crypto-
Assets Regulation, or has established a regulatory framework for crypto-assets,  MiCA, 
including stablecoins. The regulatory guidelines should be updated and refined where 
necessary.
But stablecoins hold opportunities as well as risks. In certain areas of application, such 
as the direct and automated delivery-versus-payment transactions I mentioned earlier, 
they can offer added value and complement existing structures in a useful way. Overall, 
framework conditions should remain innovation-friendly–not least with respect to 
European issuers' euro-pegged stablecoins.
In the digital financial system of the future, Europe must be mindful of its sovereignty. 
That is another reason why, here in Europe, we want to take a different approach to 
digital central bank money than, say, the United States. In the United States, digital 
central bank money is prohibited by executive order. This brings me to the third step I 
want to discuss today.
4 Promoting digital central bank money
European digital central bank money could help to strengthen the role played by the 
euro internationally. It would be an important milestone for the Savings and Investments 
Union, and a logical response to stablecoins.
There are two types of digital central bank money: the retail variant could be used at 
any time by anyone wishing to make an electronic payment–whether at the point of 
sale, when shopping online or for payments among friends. The wholesale variant 
would be used to settle transactions between financial institutions in central bank 
money using new technologies. Both types of digital central bank money could help to 
strengthen the euro area's resilience, autonomy and efficiency in the field of payments.
Let me briefly turn to the current situation regarding the digital retail euro. It is intended 
as a digital supplement to cash that would be available free of charge anywhere in the 
euro area. In mid-July, theECB published its third progress report on the digital euro    
preparation phase.Work on the draft rulebook has progressed further, with advances 11 
in technical testing, user research and engagement with stakeholders.
It is crucial for the Eurosystem's work that the necessary legislation is adopted as 
quickly as possible at the European level: the digital euro needs a legal basis before a 
decision can be taken on its introduction. As things stand, it probably won't be possible 
to launch the digital euro before 2028.

5/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
In my view, the time is ripe for central banks to offer a digital complement to cash. 
People's needs and preferences have changed. They are tending to use less and less 
cash. But they value cash characteristics, like privacy. The digital euro would meet the 
highest standards of data protection and privacy. In addition, an offline solution would 
be available even without an internet connection or given technical disruptions.
Banks and other payment service providers could use the public infrastructure for the 
digital euro as a basis for innovation. So far, cash is the only European means of 
payment that is accessible and accepted throughout the euro area. For our electronic 
payments, we often have to rely on a handful of non-European companies.
The digital euro would make one of Europe's critical infrastructures more independent. 
This seems more important than ever in view of growing geopolitical tensions and 
uncertainties. The same applies to wholesale digital central bank money.
The ability to settle large-value critical financial market transactions in central bank 
money based on distributed ledger technology, orwould have the following  DLT, 
advantages: more efficient–that is, faster–settlement processes, a higher degree of 
automation, programmability, streamlined and thus cheaper settlement processes, and 
reduced settlement risks.
In an exploratory phase, the Eurosystem tested three solutions together with financial 
market participants.Market demand was high and participants expressed their 12 
interest in a continuation after the trial phase. In early July, theECB presented a dual-   
track strategy for the settlement ofDLT transactions.    13
"Pontes" is the short-term track, which is intended to provide a pilot solution by the end 
of 2026 to linkDLT platforms to ourTARGET services. The aim is to offer a swift and        
pragmatic solution to meet the high market demand. It is important to act as quickly as 
possible so that market participants do not opt for alternatives such as stablecoins. The 
long-term track "Appia" aims to achieve an innovative and integrated financial 
ecosystem in Europe. This solution is also intended to be globally compatible.
At the end of this chapter on the meaning and purpose of digital central bank money, 
it's important to add that changing needs and technologies demand a response. We 
central banks have to move with the times. Even in an increasingly digital world, the 
euro should and will remain an attractive means of payment for all. The Eurosystem has 
played a pioneering role with its extensive work on digital central bank money.
5 Conclusion: Take fate into our own hands
In conclusion, I have outlined the key building blocks for a strong and sovereign 
Europe. These can complement each other, mutually amplify their impact and combine 
to form an impressive whole. The launch of the retail digital euro and wholesale digital 
central bank money would be milestones for the Savings and Investments Union. All of 
the building blocks would counteract existing and potential fragmentation. They would 
also help to strengthen the role played by the euro internationally.
For one thing, theUS dollar is no longer seen unreservedly as a safe haven. For    
another, dollarisation could increase ifUS dollar stablecoins become more widespread.    

6/7 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
For the foreseeable future, it appears neither realistic nor desirable for the euro to 
replace theUS dollar as the world's key currency. However, it certainly would be both    
possible and desirable for the international importance of the euro to increase.
In a world of change, Europe should not surrender to its fate, but should confidently 
take it into its own hands. On that front, we can take the words of Henry David 
Thoreau as encouragement, or even a warning: What a man thinks of himself, that it is 
." We have strong foundations: which determines, or rather indicates, his fate
democracy, the separation of powers and the rule of law. Independent media, 
independent statistics collection, an independent central bank. We have our single 
market, successful firms and highly skilled workers.
I have no doubt that we are prepared to take the three steps I've outlined–for a strong 
euro, for a sovereign Europe, for a modern and resilient European payments system 
with the digital euro. If we take these steps, we will increase Europe's economic 
strength, attractiveness and independence.
