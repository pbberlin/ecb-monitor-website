Philip R Lane: Monetary policy - new challenges
Speech by Mr Philip R Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central 
Bank, at the Barclays-Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) International 
Monetary Policy Forum 2025, London, 24 June 2025.

Since the extraordinary inflation surges in 2021-2022, the primary challenge facing 
monetary policy has been to return inflation to target in a timely mannerIn terms of .1 
interest rate policy, this required a rapid hiking cycle from July 2022 to September 2023, 
followed by a "hold at peak" phase and then a gradual reversal of the restrictive stance 
starting in June 2024.The gradualism in the easing phase reflected ongoing 2 
uncertainty about the speed of the disinflation process.
While headline inflation is currently around the target, services inflation still has some 
distance to travel to make sure that inflation stabilises at the target on a sustainable 
basis. Still, there has been sufficient progress in returning inflation to target to consider 
that this monetary policy challenge is largely completed. This assessment is reinforced 
by the accumulating evidence that the remaining services disinflation is well on track: 
first, the projection errors for inflation, including for the services subcomponent, have 
been relatively small during the disinflation process; second, both the wage tracker data 
and survey indicators suggest that further deceleration in wage growth can be expected 
in both 2025 and 2026, facilitating further declines in services inflation.
However, this disinflation challenge has been superseded by a new set of challenges 
and monetary policymakers have to make sure that the medium-term inflation target is 
protected in a volatile environment in which, amongst other factors, there is high 
uncertainty about the future of long-standing international trade system.This 3 
uncertainty extends beyond the calibration of new tariff regimes and includes the 
possibility of a broader set of non-tariff barriers, a deeper intertwining of economic 
policies and security policies and possible revisions to the treatment of foreign portfolio 
investors and foreign direct investors. In addition to policy uncertainty, geopolitical 
tensions, such as Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the 
Middle East, remain a major source of uncertainty. Reflecting these developments, we 
have seen high volatility in energy prices this year and substantial currency repricing. 
There has also been considerable financial market volatility.
At the same time (and largely as an endogenous reaction to the changed security 
landscape), the fiscal outlook for the euro area has materially changed for the coming 
years, with the overall fiscal deficit looking set to remain above three per cent over the 
projection horizon. The near-term and medium-term implications for output and inflation 
of the structural changes associated with the green transition, the increasing business 
adoption of artificial intelligence applications and global shifts in comparative advantage 
are also highly uncertain, operating both on demand and supply with potentially 
different timelines.
Especially under current conditions of high uncertainty, it is essential to remain data 
dependent and take a meeting-by-meeting approach in making monetary policy

decisions, with no pre-commitment to any particular future rate path. In addition to 
observing how activity and inflation are actually behaving, data dependence also 
extends to the incoming data on policy settings outside the monetary domain, since 
shifts in international and domestic policy regimes are highly relevant for future inflation 
dynamics. In this environment, the primary task for monetary policy makers is to make 
sure that any temporary deviations from target do not turn into longer-term deviations.
This orientation explains our June decision to cut rates by 25 basis points. The June 
projections were conditioned on a rate path that included a quarter-point reduction of 
the deposit facility rate (DFR) in June: model-based optimal policy simulations and an 
array of monetary policy feedback rules indicated a cut was appropriate under the 
baseline and also constituted a robust decision, remaining appropriate across a range 
of alternative future paths for inflation and the economy. By supporting the pricing 
pressure needed to generate target-consistent inflation in the medium-term, this cut 
helps ensure that the projected negative inflation deviation over the next eighteen 
months remains temporary and does not convert into a longer-term deviation of inflation 
from the target. This cut also guards against any uncertainty about our reaction function 
by demonstrating that we are determined to make sure that inflation returns to target in 
the medium term. This helps to underpin inflation expectations and avoid an 
unwarranted tightening in financial conditions.
It is worth noting, in particular, that the robustness of the decision was also supported 
by a set of model-based optimal policy simulations conducted on various combinations 
of the trade scenarios discussed in the Eurosystem staff projections report, even when 
also factoring in upside scenarios for fiscal expenditure. By contrast, leaving the DFR 
on hold at 2.25 per cent could have triggered an adverse repricing of the forward curve 
and a revision in inflation expectations that would risk generating a more pronounced 
and longer-lasting undershoot of the inflation target. In turn, if this risk materialised, a 
stronger monetary reaction would ultimately be required.
Looking ahead, our monetary policy will have to take into account not only the most 
likely path (the baseline) but also the risks to activity and inflation. To this end, it will be 
important to explore how alternative rate paths hold up in various plausible sensitivity 
and scenario analyses, in order to make sure we minimise the risk of extended 
deviations from our medium-term target.

and the expiry of the TLTRO III funding programme.
