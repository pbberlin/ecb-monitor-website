Olli Rehn: Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary 
Affairs of the European Parliament
Speech by Mr Olli Rehn, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the Hearing of the 
Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Brussels, 
20 February 2025.

Thank you for inviting me here today to discuss how I intend to conduct my duties as 
the First Vice-Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). Let me begin by 
saying that as a former Vice-President of this House and of the European Commission, 
I hold dialogue with Parliament in the highest regard.
I trust we are all aware of the hazardous complexities of our time. History seems to be 
experiencing a sudden jolt of acceleration – into reverse. The reaction from Europe to 
the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties should, I believe, be firm and forward-looking, 
creating a Europe that is stronger and more united – on the economy and finance, 
defence and security.
We at the ESRB are monitoring developments on the other side of the Atlantic with 
concern. The new US Administration is establishing new priorities, including significant 
deregulation of the financial system. This deregulation is also aimed at new sectors, 
such as private finance, non-bank financial intermediation and crypto-assets. We are 
vigilantly assessing its implications and the potential risks to the EU financial sector.
Having said that, we must not simply be on the defensive. I am convinced that the EU 
has the potential to deliver on the essential goals of competitiveness and productivity 
growth, as outlined in the Letta, Draghi and Niinistö reports. I also remain convinced 1
that building up a savings and investment union will be essential for enabling the EU to 
provide its citizens and businesses with the public good of a competitive and integrated 
financial system – one which can also foster their security. I should add that I firmly 
endorse all the efforts by the European Commission in this direction.
As First Vice-Chair of the ESRB, my priorities are shaped by the insights yielded by the 
High-Level Group on the ESRB Review. I had the privilege of chairing this Group and 
working with three esteemed colleagues: Advisory Scientific Committee Vice-Chair 
Professor Stephen Cecchetti, ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos and Advisory 
Technical Committee Chair Pablo Hernández de Cos. Together, we examined the 
ESRB's performance over the last ten years, as well as the legal provisions 
underpinning ESRB functions.
Our goal was to contribute to the upcoming review of the ESRB Regulation by bringing 
our strategic advice on the ESRB's future. We recently published our  and shared report
it with your Committee. Importantly, some of our proposals might require legislative 
changes. I hope that your Committee will consider these in the upcoming review of the 
ESRB Regulation.2

Let me continue here by taking a look at the big picture. I believe that the ESRB has 
been successful in fulfilling its mandate of macroprudential oversight. The comparative 
advantage of the ESRB lies in its unique position: being able to monitor and assess the 
prevention and mitigation of systemic risks and vulnerabilities across the entire EU 
financial system.
This is why the High-Level Group on the ESRB Review focused on how to enhance the 
ESRB's holistic assessment of systemic risk. Let me give you two examples of the 
advancements that we have in mind.
First, we envisage top-down system-wide stress tests covering the entire EU financial 
system. Such system-wide stress tests would allow us to examine where fragilities lie in 
the financial system – and to identify the weakest link in the chain.
Let me stress that what we have in mind is a top-down desktop exercise. This means 
that it would not create any additional requirements – such as reporting requirements – 
for market participants. It would help us if you could provide a legal anchor for such a 
system-wide stress test in the ESRB Regulation.
Second, we propose enhanced access to data. The ESRB needs access to granular 
data on financial institutions, non-financial corporations, households and governments. 
We need this to analyse how entities are interlinked and how risks can spread 
throughout the financial system. This, of course, is also key to running the top-down 
system-wide stress tests I discussed a moment ago.
The ESRB already benefits from immediate and automatic access to many datasets. 
But some key datasets are only available in response to ad hoc requests. In other 
words, we have access to these datasets, but it is not continuous and automatic, as the 
ESRB – and the other authorities involved – need to follow a somewhat cumbersome 
procedure.
The European Parliament has recognised that this hampers our capability to monitor 
the financial system and has proposed a solution in a recent legislative procedure. 
Unfortunately, your proposal of data sharing by default between the European 
Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and the ESRB has not become part of the final 
compromise on the legal text.
I hope that this Committee will continue its efforts to grant the ESRB immediate and 
automatic access to regular supervisory data collected by the ESAs. The upcoming 
ESRB Review provides an opportunity to enhance our framework in this regard.
Allow me to conclude by highlighting another, equally important element: 
communication. Since the ESRB does not have any binding powers, its warnings and 
recommendations will only be taken into account if it is able to convince others.
Communicating about financial stability is not always straightforward and can be 
challenging. Being keenly aware of this, we aim to focus ever more intensely on our 
communication efforts. It is perhaps something of a paradox that the longer 
macroprudential policy is successful – or, to put it another way, the more the memory of 

3/3 BIS - Central bankers' speeches
the last financial crisis fades – the more probable it is that financial stability will be 
overlooked in public debate.
Nevertheless, macroprudential policies are and will remain essential. We must not 
forget that financial stability is a prerequisite for sustainable growth. A stable financial 
system not only fosters sustainable growth but also supports innovation. It ensures 
access to credit and creates confidence in the economy, thereby contributing to the well-
being of all Europeans. It is therefore our hope that this Committee will help us further 
improve the holistic assessment of risks in the EU, including through enhancing the 
ESRB's access to data.
By ensuring that macroprudential policy decisions are grounded in relevant data and 
based on strong analytics, we will be in a better position to tackle current and future 
challenges together.
Thank you very much.
