SPEECH
Euro area international financial flows:
analytical insights and measurement
challenges
Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board
of the ECB, at the joint Banco de Espajna, Irving Fisher Committee
on Central Bank Statistics and European Central Bank conference
“External statistics after the pandemic: addressing novel analytical
challenges” in Madrid
Madrid, 12 February 2024
Introduction
It is my great pleasure to speak at this second edition of the conference on external statistics, jointly
organised by the Banco de Espana, the Irving Fisher Committee and the European Central Bank, after
having contributed already to the first edition of this conference in Lisbon in February 2020, just before
the onset of the pandemic. 4] As a long-standing user of external statistics, both in academia and as a
central banker, | am very pleased to see that since the last conference the richness and availability of
external statistics — in particular for the euro area — has been further enhanced. This is of particularly
high value for the analysis we do regularly at the ECB, as | will show today. At the same time, there
are still significant measurement shortfalls in external statistics and many analytical hurdles to
overcome, including specific challenges for the euro area.
Today| will focus on the analysis of euro area financial flows, in the current context of the monetary
policy tightening cycle and elevated geopolitical tensions. In addition, | will outline some areas where |
see potential for further enhancing the statistical information available for such analysis and for
improving the underlying statistical infrastructure.
The euro area is highly financially integrated, both internally and externally: an accurate measurement
of financial linkages is key for our understanding of euro area exposures to external shocks and the
international transmission of the ECB’s policies. The analysis of euro area cross-border financial
linkages has become increasingly complex in recent years, in particular owing to the expansion of
international financial intermediation chains, which often involve non-bank entities located in
international financial centres, including in some euro area countries.4! At the same time, the ECB —
together with the euro area national central banks — has developed new breakdowns of the euro area
balance of payments and international investment position (b.0.p./i.i.p.) statistics that facilitate an
enhanced, albeit still imperfect, analysis of risk exposures and interconnectedness.2
Euro area financial flows at the current juncture


Euro area international financial flows sharply reversed in 2022 — from a multi-year peak observed in
2021 — into the largest retrenchment since the global financial crisis (Chart 1).41 The retrenchment
affected both foreign assets and foreign liabilities, in line with their strong co-movement observed over
the past decades. More recently, in 2023, euro area financial flows started to pick up again.

The swings in euro area international financial flows over the past few years were to a great extent
driven by foreign portfolio investment and foreign direct investment (Chart 2), Accordingly, | will focus
my remarks on these two components of the financial account that — due to the intricacies of euro area
financial intermediation — require a particularly careful analysis. To this end, | will use the available
detailed official statistics, but also draw on insights from research studies.

Notes: For assets, a positive (negative) number indicates net purchases (sales) of non-euro area instruments by
euro area investors. For liabilities, a positive (negative) number indicates net purchases (sales) of euro area
instruments by non-euro area investors. The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2023.
Euro area portfolio investment flows — the sectoral dimension
| start by examining detailed information at the euro area (resident) sectoral level to better understand
the factors driving aggregate foreign portfolio investment flows. Focusing on the non-bank financial
intermediaries sector provides valuable insights.
At a structural level, the sectoral breakdown reveals the predominance of the investment funds sector
(including money market funds) as holders of portfolio investment securities issued by non-euro area
residents. It accounts for 64% of total equity and debt holdings in the third quarter of 2023. It follows
that an analysis of the cross-border investment patterns by investment funds is crucial, not only for
assessing the exposures of the investment fund sector, but also for understanding those of the
underlying investors. Insurance companies, pension funds and households are significant holders of
euro area investment fund shares, while foreign investors residing outside the euro area are also
major investors in euro area funds. Recent research shows that euro area investment funds are a
source of portfolio diversification for the underlying euro area investors, in particular towards extra-
euro area assets. For foreign investors, euro area investment funds not only provide exposure to
euro area assets but also constitute intermediation vehicles for global portfolio investment.
Investment funds account for a significant proportion of the fluctuations in international portfolio
investment flows (Chart 3). This is consistent with a procyclical demand for investment fund shares,
with the underlying investors strongly affected by shifts in global sentiment. This helps to explain the
2022 retrenchment, given the low risk appetite prevailing in global financial markets following the


Russian invasion of Ukraine. The data also confirm that insurance corporations and pension funds
tend to be more stable investors, at least in relation to their direct holdings.

Notes: For assets, a positive (negative) number indicates net purchases (sales) of non-euro area instruments by
euro area investors. Investment funds include money market funds. Other sectors include governments, non-
financial corporations, and households and non-profit institutions serving households. The latest observation is for
the third quarter of 2023.
While a structural analysis of the drivers of euro area portfolio flows is beyond the scope of today’s
remarks, | would like to highlight that — apart from the geopolitical factors weighing on investor
sentiment — the monetary policy tightening of the ECB may also have contributed to the retrenchment
in portfolio flows. In fact, the shifts in investment patterns observed in 2022 marked an end toa
protracted phase of large-scale portfolio rebalancing towards extra-euro area securities, which had
started in 2014 when the ECB introduced negative interest rates and launched its asset purchase
programmes. | More recently, the net purchases of foreign securities by euro area investors
rebounded amid the global shift in the interest rate environment, with higher interest rates especially
prompting a step-up in international bond purchases.
On the liability side of euro area portfolio investment, investment funds played a similarly large role in
the drying-up of foreign net purchases of euro area equities in 2022. The combination of the sizeable
euro area investment fund industry and the strong extra-euro area investor base — especially for those
funds based in Ireland and Luxembourg — amplifies euro area financial flows, particularly during times
of sharp shifts in risk sentiment (Chart 4). At the same time, since the amplification in part reflects the
pass-through holdings of external investors in external assets, the impact on euro area financial
dynamics is overstated by focusing on un-adjusted measures.

Notes: For liabilities, a positive (negative) number indicates net purchases (sales) of euro area instruments by
non-euro area investors. Investment funds include money market funds. Other sectors include the Eurosystem,
households and non-profit institutions serving households, insurance corporations and pension funds. The latest
observation is for the third quarter of 2023.
Higher euro area interest rates and the ending of net asset purchases by the Eurosystem have visibly
boosted the appetite of foreign investors for euro area debt securities since 2022 (Chart 4). This is a
reversal of the pattern during the years 2014-2019 when foreign investors were large net sellers of
euro area debt securities, especially sovereign bonds. That is, monetary policy clearly plays a
significant role in determining net foreign debt inflows, via both the level of interest rates and balance
sheet policies. In an environment of rising interest rates, foreign investors have turned into net buyers
of euro area debt securities, especially sovereign bonds and bank bonds.
Euro area portfolio investment flows — the geographic dimension
The new counterpart breakdowns available in the euro area b.o.p./i.i.p. allow for a better coverage of
the geography of international financial flows, vis-a-vis both advanced economies and emerging
market economies.“ These data reveal that in 2022 euro area investors reduced their exposures to
equity securities in a broad-based fashion across geographic counterparts (Chart 5) 02] The
retrenchment was particularly pronounced vis-a-vis the United States and the United Kingdom.

Notes: For assets, a positive (negative) number indicates net purchases (sales) of non-euro area instruments by
euro area investors. “Other advanced and other EU” include Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway, South Korea and
Switzerland as well as the non-euro area EU Member States and those EU institutions and bodies that are
considered for statistical purposes as being outside the euro area, such as the European Commission and the
European Investment Bank. “Emerging and developing economies’ include all countries and country groups not
shown in the chart, as well as unallocated transactions. The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2023.
For debt securities, the picture is more nuanced: during the retrenchment in 2022, euro area investors
on balance sold a significant amount of securities issued by US and UK residents, while net purchases
continued vis-a-vis other advanced economies and the non-euro area EU (Chart 5). The strong net
sales of debt issued by emerging market economies and offshore financial centres were particularly
striking, especially given their relatively small weight in the euro area portfolio. Among emerging
market economies, these net sales were driven by disinvestments of securities issued in China,
Mexico and Russia.“2] while euro area net purchases of debt securities recovered strongly vis-a-vis
most regions in 2023, the sentiment towards emerging economies and offshore financial centres
remained muted.
While at first sight emerging economies and offshore financial centres may appear as rather unrelated
investment destinations, these are in fact closely linked, since the debt securities issued in offshore
financial centres are to a significant extent issued by subsidiaries of corporations based in emerging
markets, particularly in China. Recent research, as presented in the first session today, finds that euro
area and US investment in emerging market corporate bonds is substantially larger when investment
in issuance by offshore subsidiaries of emerging market corporations is taken into account.4] For the
euro area, estimates show that the “nationality-based” holdings of corporate debt securities of the
BRICS countries are around six times higher.“5! This example highlights the difficulty in tracing
ultimate exposures across the financial intermediation chains. At the same time, it shows how
ambitious research involving the careful merging of various datasets may provide complementary
information to the public, which could lay the ground for future enhancements to official statistics.


While information on the geography of euro area portfolio investment assets has become increasingly
rich, it is notoriously difficult to obtain a full grasp of the foreign holders of euro area securities.“4 This
relates to the phenomenon of globally missing assets, as the portfolio investment liabilities that are
reported globally consistently exceed reported assets.“4 This gap, in turn, can be linked to a
significant degree to equity securities issued in the United States, Ireland and Luxembourg. 21 There
is a range of conjectures on the origins of the globally missing assets. A primary explanation relates to
the non-reporting of assets held in custody abroad (so-called third party holdings), in particular by
investors with no statistical reporting obligation such as households or non-financial corporations.
Within the euro area, such third-party holdings are already reported by custodians as part of the
securities holdings statistics, which increases the coverage of intra-euro area portfolio investment
holdings. However, security holdings that are held in custody outside the euro area can at best be
estimated. In closing this significant data gap, | see room for international initiatives to promote a
comprehensive and granular reporting of third-party holdings (for instance in the context of the IMF’s
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey) by those countries with a strong custody industry./24)
Euro area foreign direct investment flows
Taking a longer-term perspective, euro area foreign direct investment (FDI) flows were remarkably
stable for decades, even during crisis times, before entering a phase of exceptionally large, positive
flows from about 2015 (as shown in Chart 2). This was followed by a period of high volatility and —
more recently — a strong retrenchment phase. 221
As | have noted on previous occasions, the developments in FDI over the past decade have been very
much driven by euro area financial centres due to the presence of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in
these economies.22] MNEs tend to have complex organisational structures which frequently involve
numerous legal entities, including special-purpose entities (SPEs), across various countries.24]
While the interpretation of euro area headline FDI figures has not become easier over the years, more
detailed sectoral and geographic breakdowns facilitate the analysis of FDI. Moreover, our
understanding of euro area FDI is set to improve further in the near future, with the publication of a
separate breakdown for SPEs in euro area b.o.p./i.i.p. statistics.
Taking a sectoral view of the retrenchment observed in euro area FDI since 2022 reveals the important
role of the other financial institutions (OF1) category, which also includes SPEs and holding companies
(Chart 6), 1251 The strong positive correlation between gross FDI asset and liability transactions related
to OF ls suggests that these “financialised” flows often “pass through” the euro area without being
absorbed in the domestic economy. Preliminary data suggest that SPEs represent around 30 per cent
of euro area FDI asset and liability positions and 55 per cent of FDI assets and liability positions in the
OFI sector. More insights on the role of SPEs in euro area cross-border statistics will become available
with the publication of the b.o.p./i.i.p. dataset for SPEs this spring.

Notes: For assets, a positive (negative) number indicates net purchases (sales) of non-euro area instruments by
euro area investors. For liabilities, a positive (negative) number indicates net purchases (sales) of euro area
instruments by non-euro area investors. “Other sectors” include all institutional sectors not shown in the chart. The
latest observation is for the third quarter of 2023.
In contrast to OF |-related FDI flows, the FDI flows of the non-financial corporate sector are mainly
driven by the euro area countries outside the group of financial centres and hence tend to be more
closely related to developments in the real economy. Accordingly, while there was no large-scale
retrenchment, the recent slowdown in this sector’s FDI transactions appears to be consistent with
lower global and euro area growth momentum and might also provide tentative signs of companies
pulling back from overseas direct investment amid heightened geopolitical risks./241
The geographic breakdown of FDI flows brings additional insights (Chart 7). The recent retrenchment
occurred vis-a-vis counterparts in the United States, United Kingdom and in offshore financial centres,
which suggests a close relation to MNE operations, particularly in combination with the sectoral
evidence presented before. Having said this, euro area FDI asset flows to other destinations have
proven to be more resilient in recent years, albeit on a much smaller scale.

Similarly to portfolio investment, even these more detailed FDI data remain insufficient to fully look
through the often complex cross-border chains to identify the ultimate investor countries and ultimate
host economies involved in FDI relationships. This is a notoriously difficult task, not only due to the
complex ownership structures of MNEs, but also because it requires very comprehensive information.
Sharing data among national statisticians across borders could be helpful — something | will return to
later in my remarks. Nonetheless, some research-based advancements in identifying the ultimate
countries involved in an FDI relationship (also to be presented at this conference) provide useful
insights 24 Data on inward FDI on an ultimate basis reveal, for example, a much larger role of the
United States as an investor in the EU compared to the official (immediate counterparty basis) data./22
Potential enhancements to data and statistical infrastructure
Combining b.o.p./i.i.p. statistics with security-level data such as the European System of Central
Banks’ (ESCB) Securities Holdings Statistics allows for a granular analysis along various dimensions,
such as currency, issuing entity and security characteristics, including the rating.221 For the latter,
experimental ECB data on euro area portfolio investment assets show an increase in the share of
high-rated debt securities since 2021, in line with a preference for safer assets during times of
elevated risk aversion (Chart 8).22

Notes: Experimental data following Rodriguez Caloca, A., Radke, T. and Schmitz, M. (2021). The ratings
categories are drawn from the Eurosystem Credit Assessment Framework (ECAF). The ECAF provides a
harmonised rating scale of five credit quality steps. The first step includes securities rated from AAA to AA-, the
second from A+ to A-, the third from BBB+ to BBB-. In addition, the fourth category includes all rated securities
with a rating below credit quality step three and the fifth category reflects those securities without a rating. The
latest observation is for the third quarter of 2023.
In addition, and this also stressed in the ongoing update of the balance of payment manual, it is very
useful to have a fully integrated view of the international investment position, showing how the
transmission of financial shocks propagates through the valuation channel arising from exchange rates
and other asset price movements to an economy’s external balance sheet.2] Unlike when I started
doing research on this topic, nowadays such data are readily available in the official statistics of many
economies, including for the euro area, with a considerable degree of detail, and show, for example,
the importance of exchange rate-induced valuation effects (Chart 9).

Note: The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2023.
To enhance the analysis of globalisation-related phenomena, and in particular to isolate the impact of
MNEs, | support the plans of the ESCB to establish new data on foreign-controlled non-financial
corporations in the balance of payments and the financial sector accounts. It would also be essential
for such data to be available for the non-financial accounts, in order to observe the impact of MNEs on
production and capital formation patterns. In this context, | would like to stress once more that it is
analytically very useful to have fully consistent data on external accounts and domestic sectoral
accounts, as is the case for the euro area datasets on b.o.p. and quarterly sector accounts. This
supports the analysis of interconnectedness and helps to identify domestic sector imbalances that
ultimately drive external imbalances.221
More generally, in terms of statistical infrastructure, | would like to highlight again that further efforts
are needed to improve the analytical value of macroeconomics statistics. In my view, to keep official
statistics fit for policy analysis, these need to enable a fast response to crises and keep pace with the
rapidly evolving global activities of MNEs and financial intermediaries. For example, | am very much in
favour of the development and use of experimental statistics to boost statistical agility. In this context,
the pandemic has shown the usefulness of “non-standard” higher-frequency data sources, for instance
to enhance our understanding of labour market dynamics.
Another improvement that is worth considering is facilitating the safe exchange of confidential
statistical information for well-justified statistical purposes across borders, especially within the


ESCB/European Statistical System (ESS). This can be achieved by a sound and supportive legal
basis, coupled with robust and safe information technology systems supporting the exchange of data.
This would minimise the risks of unlawful disclosures, while maximising the benefits of synergies
through collaboration between statistical authorities.221
As | have advocated before, there is a strong case for exploring avenues to collect data on
internationally active, large MNEs in a centralised way, at the EU rather than national level. This could
eliminate information gaps and overlaps across countries and ensure a more timely, complete and
consistent cross-country recording of the activities of MNEs. A coordinated approach across the EU
could be a win-win situation, as it would reduce the statistical reporting burden of MNEs by removing
the need to complete questionnaires from 27 Member States in more than 20 languages. This
streamlined process would not only benefit the MNEs themselves but also the statistical authorities
responsible for collecting and analysing the data. It would improve timeliness, enhance the accuracy of
reporting and ultimately contribute to a more efficient and effective system of data management. This
is already being pursued by the ESCB in relation to the banking industry through standardising area-
wide data reporting by banks. 241
Conclusion
In my remarks today | have focused on euro area financial flows in the current context of the monetary
policy tightening cycle and geopolitical tensions. | have stressed the usefulness of available data for
the regular analysis we do at the ECB, but | have also highlighted the areas where measurement
issues still hamper our full understanding of portfolio investment and foreign direct investment
EXpOsures.
| would like to highlight once more that further efforts are needed to improve the analytical value of
external statistics and this can be achieved by enhancing the underlying statistical infrastructure.
As a long-standing user of external statistics, | very much look forward to the discussions at this
conference and will closely follow future enhancements to the data on cross-border statistics.

The list of counterpart countries now includes for instance all G-20 and EU countries outside the euro
area. In particular, information became available for a number of additional advanced economies
(Australia, Norway and South Korea) and emerging market economies (Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico,
Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkiye).

Foreign direct investment-related flows were traditionally considered to be the least volatile category of
international capital flows. See, for example, Eichengreen, B., Gupta, P. and Masetti, O. (2018), “Are
Capital Flows Fickle? Increasingly? And Does the Answer Still Depend on Type?”, Asian Economic
Papers, Vol. 17(1), pp. 22-41. However, in recent years the strong role of multinational enterprises has
been accompanied by increased volatility, especially for small open economies. See, for example, Di
Nino, V., Habib, M. and Schmitz, M. (2020), “Multinational enterprises, financial centres and their
implications for external imbalances: a euro area perspective”, Economic Bulletin, |ssue 2, ECB.

Euro area financial centres commonly include Belgium, Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and the
Netherlands.
24.
SPEs located in euro area financial centres typically hold equities, manage debt issuance and allocate
funding across parent and subsidiaries.

Further developments of approaches combining micro and macro data, for example to measure euro
area portfolio investment holdings of sustainable debt securities, will be very much welcome (see
“Experimental indicators on sustainable finance” on the ECB’s website). More broadly, the data needs
in macroeconomic statistics to cover climate change and sustainable finance have become very
apparent in recent years. These include, for instance, the recommendations of the third data gaps
initiative regarding climate change and FDI statistics presenting the associated carbon footprints as
well as physical and transition risks. Official statistics in this field are needed to assess the social and
economic impact of climate change and monitor the financial vulnerabilities stemming from physical
and transitional risks.
