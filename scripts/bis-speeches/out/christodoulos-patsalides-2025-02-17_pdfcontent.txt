Introduction - Strategic Vision Statement and Elaboration
Distinguished guests, esteemed colleagues,
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the organizers of the 12th Banking Forum 
and Fintech Expo for bringing us together for this important exchange of ideas and 
insights.
It is my privilege to have today the opportunity to present the strategic vision and 
priorities of the Central Bank of Cyprus. In an ever-evolving global and digital economy, 
we are committed to leading the way in fostering a resilient, innovative, and sustainable 
financial sector for Cyprus. Our agenda focuses on embracing digital transformation, 
ensuring robust governance, addressing societal and environmental challenges, and 
safeguarding financial stability.
Today, I will outline our key priorities, including advancements in the digital economy, 
the evolving role of digital payments, the potential introduction of a digital euro, and the 
regulatory frameworks that ensure responsible governance and societal considerations 
in our financial systems. Through these efforts, we aim to strengthen Cyprus' position 
as a dynamic player within the European financial landscape.
Cyprus Economy
To ground our strategic vision, we must first examine the economic landscape in which 
the Cyprus economy operates. With its key sectors-ICT (Information Communication 
Technology), tourism, trade, shipping, and construction-, the economy has 
demonstrated resilience and adaptability despite the consecutive significant geopolitical 
challenges, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. In recent 
years, Cyprus has achieved robust growth rate well above the EU average and 
maintained a strong fiscal position, consistently posting surpluses that have bolstered 
public finances. As a result, international rating agencies have upgraded their ratings 
well within the investment grade, highlighting our sound economic management, fiscal 
discipline, and reforms in the banking sector.
Banking Sector in Cyprus
Building on the strength of our economy is the Cypriot banking sector, which has built 
up remarkable resilience and robustness despite a series of unprecedented and 
successive crises in recent years. The sector's solvency, as indicated by the Common 
Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, rose to 23,5% in the third quarter of 2024, achieving its 
highest level on record and significantly surpassing the European average of 16,0%.

Additionally, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)-a key indicator of credit institutions' 
capacity to withstand severe liquidity stress-reached 336% in September 2024. This 
level exceeds the regulatory minimum of 100% by more than threefold and stands well 
above the European average of 161,4%. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio fell to 
6,5% in the third quarter of 2024, marking its lowest level since 2014, when the NPL 
definition was standardized across the European Union.
However, there is no room for complacency as macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical 
risks, and emerging threats like cyber and climate risks grow. Banks must adapt quickly 
to identify and address these evolving challenges effectively. Moreover, technological 
advancements bring about a new landscape in which banks are called upon to 
compete. The pursuit of an appropriate business model is key.
Digital Economy and Global Digital Trends
As we look toward the future, the digital economy emerges as a defining feature of 
global trends. Technology has the ability to sustain and improve our standards of living 
and the long-term productivity of our economy. Examples of innovative technologies 
used in financial services (usually referred to as FinTech) include artificial intelligence, 
cloud computing, digital wallets, big data analytics and biometrics. These technologies 
have been applied to improve customer service, automate payments, reengineer 
business processes, detect suspicious activity, and assist with customer profiling and 
digital onboarding. However, we are yet to see the realization of potential in other 
promising new technologies such as distributed ledger technology (DLT), smart 
contracts and tokenization.
As technology becomes more widespread in our evolving digital economy, cyber risk 
and data security continue to be by far the most prominent driver of operational risk for 
banks. Technological advances with increased sophistication, growing reliance on 
digital solutions, but also growing capabilities of cyber offenders, have all resulted in 
enhanced risk exposure for banks, including vulnerability to sophisticated cyber-attacks. 
Cyber risk is often driven by geopolitical risk, thus raising overall risk to a much higher 
level. Supervising these risks remains one of our priorities.
To take full advantage of the potential of innovative technologies responsibly while 
managing risks, common supervisory and regulatory approaches are essential. The EU 
has introduced key legislation such as DORA, PSD3, FiDA, MiCAR, and the AI Act, 
which aim to strengthen financial sector resilience and boost consumer and investor 
confidence by guiding responsible innovation. Recognizing the evolving market 
dynamics, the Central Bank of Cyprus has established an Innovation Hub to foster 
dialogue with fintech stakeholders and support domestic financial innovation.
Digital Payments in Cyprus
A key element of the digital economy is the rapid rise of digital payments. We find 
ourselves in an era where digital transformation is reshaping economies, and Cyprus is 
no exception. One of the most prominent trends is the proliferation of digital payments, 
which now capture around 96% of cashless payments. At the same time, preference for 
cash payments is shrinking, as evidenced by a remarkable decline of 11% since 2022 
that placed Cyprus at the top of euro area countries. Cypriots use cards 1,3 times more

frequently than their European peers, while our contactless card payments capture 
more than half of all card payments consistently since 2022. This reflects the readiness 
of local businesses to accept cards and to opt for terminals that embed Near-Field-
Technology. 
In the same vein, e-commerce exhibits gradual expansion, manifested by online 
purchases via cards almost doubling over a six-year period to 28% of the total of card 
payments. It is indeed remarkable that the use of mobile phones for online purchases 
has almost reached one quarter of the total, outperforming the EU average which 
stands at 16%.
As of the 9th of January of this year, instant payments have become a reality for all 
banking participants. This signifies that account-to-account payments can be effected at 
the speed that people demand in the digital and social media age: transmission within 
10 seconds, with immediate access to funds on a 24/7/365 basis, as opposed to the 
current 1-2 days waiting time. Consumers and businesses will reap the benefits in the 
months to come. 
Electronic Money Institutions & Payments Institutions
E-money payments are gaining traction, driven by opportunities in fintech, e-commerce, 
and digital payments. Having licensed 4 electronic money institutions this year, the 
Central Bank of Cyprus now supervises 27 electronic money institutions and 11 
payment institutions. 
As part of our broader strategic agenda, we are committed to drawing on international 
experience in supporting the Central Bank of Cyprus in refining its approach for 
regulating, licencing and supervising Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) and Payment 
Institutions (PIs) in Cyprus.
In December, the CBC, announced the establishment of a comprehensive licensing and 
supervisory strategy for the sector of these institutions.
For the development of this strategy, the CBC appointed an international consultancy 
firm whose experts, in collaboration with CBC staff, conducted an analysis of the sector 
and its inherent risks.
The objective of the new strategy is to pursue the prudent and sustainable growth of the 
sector. Among other measures, the strategy includes:
The enhancing and enriching of the licensing processes for institutions applying to 
participate in the sector.
The Strengthening of the supervision of institutions by implementing a risk-based 
supervisory approach for each institution and enriching supervisory tools. 
And the adoption of best practices for the operation of the sector.
To achieve these objectives, a Division for the Supervision of Electronic Money and 
Payment Institutions is being established, which will henceforth undertake the 
prudential supervision of the sector.

Digital Euro
Moving on to the digital euro, I will give a brief status update from last year's forum. As 
legislative negotiations continue in Brussels, the Eurosystem is progressing through the 
first part of the preparation phase for the digital euro, focusing on calibrating the holding 
limits without compromising financial stability or bank intermediation as the banks will 
retain their role vis-à-vis their customers. The ECB continues to rapport with the market, 
with specific holding entitlements to be defined later. The rulebook formulation, 
developed with stakeholder input, will set standards for future digital euro distributors, 
leveraging existing frameworks for cost efficiency and allowing flexibility for innovation. 
Consumers and businesses prioritize functionalities like conditional payments and 
effortless bill-splitting, guiding expectations for future services.
Moving on to the platform and infrastructure preparations, the ECB is now selecting 
candidates from its recent application process and plans to enhance engagement with 
distributors to ensure readiness for the potential issuance and successful distribution of 
the digital euro, if and when the decision to issue is made.
Allow me to take a moment to refer to our efforts at raising awareness within our market 
through various communication channels, targeting the general public, the business 
community, and financial institutions. Aside from articles that we regularly publish in the 
press and on professional social networking platforms, we invite various stakeholder 
groups to the CBC premises. Last July we gave a press conference with Mr Piero 
Cipollone, member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, as keynote 
speaker. In November we held a focus session with business associations and their 
members, and in December we presented a thorough status update of the project to the 
members of our National Payments Committee. Last but not least, the Central Bank of 
Cyprus participates in panel discussions and presents the digital euro project at various 
local and international conferences.
ESG Regulatory Landscape: Governance, Society, and Climate 
Change
A. Governance
As we embrace these innovations, we remain steadfast in our commitment to strong 
governance. Governance, a core pillar of ESG, is crucial in enhancing transparency, 
accountability, and ethical standards in financial institutions. Strong governance 
enables sound lending decisions, reduces conflicts of interest, and ensures compliance 
with regulations including the updated Directive on Corporate Sustainability and ESG 
provisions in the recently enacted CRD 6, protecting institutional reputation and 
minimizing financial risks.
B. Encompassing Society Considerations in Business Activity: Financial Conduct
Social factors, including diversity, labour practices, community engagement, and 
adherence to human rights standards, are also vital for modern credit institutions. 
Embedding diversity in governance and fair pricing in operations fosters trust among 
stakeholders, promotes financial inclusion, and enhances institutional resilience, 
strengthening reputation and market standing.

C. Climate Change – CBC Initiatives
The Central Bank of Cyprus actively engages in thematic reviews, stress tests, and in-
depth analyses led by the European Central Bank to assess institutions' preparedness 
on climate risk and its integration into their strategy, governance, risk management and 
disclosures. This supervision helps ensure credit institutions speed up their 
preparations to manage ESG risks while meeting necessary sustainability and 
resilience standards. Additionally, the smaller institutions, directly supervised by us, 
were requested to develop implementation plans, with specific milestones, in order to 
advance the management of climate related risks, in line with the ECB's 13 supervisory 
expectations which stipulate how banks should integrate climate and environment risks 
into their business models and strategies, governance and risk appetite.
Beyond what is expected from the supervised institutions, the Central Bank of Cyprus 
has set up internally a Sustainability Team, aiming to support the CBC in addressing 
climate change in line with its mandate to maintain price stability, safeguard financial 
stability, supervise banks and support the general economic policy of the State, while 
also contributing to the target of net zero carbon emissions, and the continuation of 
strong governance. The recent visit of Mr Frank Elderson, member of the ECB's 
Executive Board and Co-Chair of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks of 
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision touched upon these issues as well.
Concluding remarks
Let me now conclude: the strategic vision of the Central Bank of Cyprus is built on the 
pursuit of price stability and financial stability in its capacity as the macroprudential 
authority of the country. By embracing the digital economy, ensuring robust 
governance, and addressing climate change, we are positioning Cyprus as a forward-
looking financial hub in Europe. Together, we will navigate the challenges and 
opportunities of the future, ensuring stability and prosperity for all.
