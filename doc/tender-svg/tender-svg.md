We are a publicly funded German research institute. 

We need a graphic for a website presenting academic information about our research on the European Central Bank -  ECB. 

You task:

* Produce a SVGator SVG graphic of the european central bank as seen from east.

* Should be scalable - so that it looks good from 300 pixels height  up to 1200 pixels height.

* Graphic should mostly show the building - as seen here

* Colors:  Use these colors ![alt text](colors-source-zew.png)

* Stroke: Wide stroke, nothing delicate - should be recognized from afar - without focusing

* Wide stroke shows the main characteristic shapes of the building -  can be "artsy" incomplete - like architectural sketch coloration

* Sparsely drawn patches of windows / windows panes - most windows should not be drawn but "implied" - a few windows are subject to modest animation - see below

* Background 1: transparent, looking good on white backgrounds, maybe a some high slim clouds (scarce style)

* Background 2: only a single line of shapes behind the building - sketching a low skyline.  

* Optionally before the building: - some simple shapes of parking lots or tree foliage  - just indicating the anchoring on the ground 

* Animation
    * One version without animation
    * Second version - identical, but with animations

* Animation should provide some small signs of "busy operation" inside the building

* Only eight animations stages

* 3 times - Lights go on and out (only small window pane color changes)

* 2 times - Somebody is walking by the window inside - small "shadow" moves behind the window pane

* 3 times - small light changes on the outer facade - nothing too intrusive - just a change in daylightn intensity - if a cloud passes by

* the eight effects should appear every 20 seconds - if possible randomly withing 10-20 seconds - if that's not possible with SVG animation - then just show one animation for 2 or 3 seconds every 20 seconds.




* SVGator source file (.svgator project file)

* SVG output created by SVGator
